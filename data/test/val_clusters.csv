Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). The presence of fibrin fibers and fibrin degradation products exert a two-fold stimulation of tPA and uPA. Plasmin activity is also inhibited by alpha2-antiplasmin. Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a carboxy-peptidase B-like proenzyme activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin dimer. TAFI cleaves (DD)E2 to separate DD and E fragments which do not enhance the activation of tPA or uPA and results in a reduced feedback signal. Disease Significance: Overabundance or increased activity of the plamsminogen activator inhibitors or reduced presence or function of tPA or uPA can result in atherosclerotic disease and venous thrombosis due to an increase in fibrin deposition or formation of a thrombus. Thrombosis can also result from plasminogen deficiency caused by a lack of protein or lack of functional protein. Reduced or depleted levels of alpha2-antiplamin can result in severe bleeding disorders."

T cells and the T cell receptor complex do not respond to antigen in solution, but even for the specific antigen they only respond to antigen-MHC-1 complexes on the cell surface. This interaction is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. T cell activation also requires a co-stimulatory signal involving interaction of CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 family genes) on the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 activates a signal transduction pathway acting through PI-3K, Lck and Grb-2/ITK to provide its co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation. Another means to control T cell activation is by expressing factors that down-regulate T cell activation. Signaling by activated T cell receptors induces expression of CTLA-4, a receptor that opposes T cell activation. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity than CD28 for B7 proteins, terminating T cell activation. ICOS is a protein related to CD28 that is only expressed on activated T cells, and that provides another important co-stimulatory signal. The requirement for co-stimulatory signals provides additional control mechanisms that prevent inappropriate and hazardous T cell activation."

It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens."

The IL-10 receptor is in the JAK/STAT class of receptors but activation of the JAK/STAT pathways by IL-10 does not appear on its own to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of this cytokine. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 appear to require induction of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through a map kinase pathway involving the p38 kinases. HO-1 is involved in the biosynthesis of heme, and catalyzes a reaction producing carbon monoxide, free iron, and the heme precursor biliverdin. HO-1 is induced by IL-10 and is also induced by oxidative stress. Blocking HO-1 with inhibitors or antisense blocks the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10. The anti-inflammatory actions of HO-1 appear to be the result of signaling by carbon monoxide it produces since removal of CO blocks the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 and HO-1. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 may be therapeutically useful either directly or through modulation of HO-1 activity."

Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type."

Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of downstream effector proteins. Studies have demonstrated that Src family PTKs are activated initially and serve to phosphorylate CD79a and CD79b thereby creating phosphotyrosine motifs that recruit downstream signaling proteins. In particular, phosphorylation of the BCR complex leads to the recruitment and activation of the PTK Syk, which in turn promotes phosphorylation of PLCg, Shc and Vav. Additionally, the Tec family member Btk is recruited to the plasma membrane where it is involved in activation of PLCg. Initiation of B lymphocyte activation is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent formation of multi-molecular effector protein complexes that activate downstream signaling pathways. The formation of such complexes was initially hypothesized to occur primarily via effector protein binding to the BCR complex itself. However, recent studies have demonstrated that productive signaling via the BCR is in fact dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more adapter proteins that play a crucial role in recruitment and organization of effector proteins at the plasma membrane. The SLP-65/BLNK adapter protein has recently been shown to play a crucial role in recruitment and activation of key signal transducing effector proteins in the B cell. After the BCR has been engaged by antigen and the activation response has been initiated, numerous second messengers and intermediate signal transducing proteins are activated. These include the production of lipid second messengers by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to yield diacylglycerol and 1,4,5-inositoltrisphosphate (IP3). DAG is important for activation of PKC whereas IP3 promote release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent influx Ca2+ from the extracellular space. Numerous intermediate signaling proteins are also activated including the Ras and Rap1, which are small molecular weight GTPases and these ultimately lead to the activation of MAP kinases including Erk, JNK and p38. The net effect of second messenger production and activation of intermediate signaling proteins is the concerted regulation of several transcription factors that mediate gene transcription in the B cell."

The two-carbon acetyl group in acetyl-CoA is transferred to the four-carbon compound of oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon compound of citrate. In a series of reactions two carbons in citrate are oxidized to CO2 and the reaction pathway supplies NADH for use in the oxidative phosphorylation and other metabolic processes. The pathway also supplies important precursor metabolites including 2-oxoglutarate. At the end of the cycle the remaining four-carbon part is transformed back to oxaloacetate.

The Cdc2-cyclin B kinase is pivotal in regulating this transition. During G2 phase, Cdc2 is maintained in an inactive state by the kinases Wee1 and Mt1. As cells approach M phase, the phosphatase Cdc25 is activated, perhaps by the polo-kinase Pik1. Cdc25 then activates Cdc2, establishing a feedback amplification loop that efficiently drives the cell into mitosis. DNA damage activates the DNA-PK/ATM/ATR kinases, initiating two parallel cascades that inactivate Cdc2-cyclin B. The first cascade rapidly inhibits progression into mitosis: the CHK kinases phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc25, which can no longer activate Cdc2. The second cascade is slower. Phosphorylation of p53 dissociates it from MDM2, activating its DNA binding activity. Acetylation by p300/PCAF further activates its transcriptional activity. The genes that are turned on by p53 constitute effectors of this second cascade. They include 14-3-3s, which binds to the phosphorylated Cdc2-cyclin B kinase and exports it from the nucleus; GADD45, which apparently binds to and dissociates the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase; and p21Cip1, an inhibitor of a subset of the cyclin-dependent kinases including Cdc2 (CDK1)."

The movement of membrane vesicles between these compartments allows proteins in the secretory pathway to move outward from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, trans Golgi network (TGN), secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane and to be secreted into the extracellular environment. The trafficking of membrane vesicles is also essential for endocytosis and the movement of material from the extracellular environment into the early endosome (EE), late endosome (LE) and lysosome. The movement of vesicles and their contents between these compartments and their secretion are essential for a host of cellular functions, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. The movement of membrane vesicles between all of these compartments is regulated by members of the Rab family of GTPases, part of the ras superfamily of genes, regulated through binding of GTP and hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. At least eleven yeast genes in this family have been identified as Ypts, yeast transport proteins, and over sixty mammalian Rab genes have been identified in this highly conserved gene family. The products of the Rab genes regulate specific steps in vesicle transport. Rab1 is involved in the movement of membranes from the ER through the Golgi. Rab3 regulates secretory vesicle release and Rab27 is also involved in regulated release of secreted proteins. Rab5, 7 and 9 contribute to endocytosis while Rab4 and Rab11 mediate recycling from the endosome back to the plasma membrane. Rab11 is involved in both endocytosis and exocytosis. As with other Ras family GTPases, the activity of Rabs is regulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GAPs (GTPase activating proteins). Downstream effectors must also interact with Rabs to transmit their signals regulating each step of the membrane trafficking pathways including vesicle formation, movement of vesicles between compartments, vesicle docking, fusion and membrane remodeling. Downstream effectors of the Rabs include Rabphilin-3 (vesicle movement effector for Rab3), Rabphilin-11 (vesicle formation effector for Rab11), and EEA1 (vesicle fusion and membrane remodeling). If Rabs are involved in more than one role and other components of Rab signaling also interact with more than one Rab this will further increase the complexity of the system. Elucidating the interaction of Rabs and regulation of vesicle trafficking by other signaling pathways will be a key area of research in the future."

NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is activated by glycoproteins on the cell surface (activating receptors) and inhibited by MHC-1 with self-peptide bound. The MHC-1 inhibitory signal through Ig-family or lectin receptors prevents NK cells from killing normal cells. Abnormal MHC-1 expression in infected or tumor cells results in the release of perforin, the lysis of the abnormal cell and the release of cytokines that stimulate the immune response. MAP kinase inhibitors but not ras inhibitors are able to block NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating that the pathway can function by a ras-independent manner that involves the MAP kinase pathway. This pathway includes phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) as a key component, followed by Rac1 and the exchange factor Vav. The tyrosine kinase SYK and LAT may provide an additional pathway for activation of MAP kinases leading to NK cell activation, and also Pyk-2 activation by integrins.

When activated, complement proteins form a pathway of proteolytic reactions that culminates in the lysis of foreign cells. The complement system also stimulates phagocytosis of foreign cells and an inflammatory response. There are two different complement systems, the classical complement pathway initiated by antibody complexes on the cell surface, and an alternative complement pathway that is initiated without antibodies. The complement system proteins are named with a capital C followed by a number. A small letter after the number indicates that the protein is a smaller protein resulting from the cleavage of a larger precursor by a protease. In the classical pathway, the first step is the initiation of the pathway triggered by recognition by complement factor C1 of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface. When C1 complex interacts with aggregates of IgG with antigen on a cell's surface, two C1-associated proteases, C1r and C1s, are activated. Other factors like lipopolysaccharide also activate C1s. Once C1s is activated, it cleaves C4 to form C4b that then binds to the cell membrane of the cell being attacked. The proteolytic complement cascade is then amplified on the cell membrane through sequential cleavage of complement factors and recruitment of new factors until a cell surface complex containing C5b, C6, C7, and C8 is formed. The addition of a multiple C9 proteins creates the membrane attack complex results in a large pore that spans the membrane of the cell being attacked, allowing ions to flow freely between the cellular interior and exterior. Ions flow out, but large molecules stay in, causing water to flood into the cell and ultimately burst the cell from osmotic pressure."

The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4. PAR1 activation may be involved in the dilation of arteries during inflammation through the action of thrombin on endothelial cells and in platelet activation by thrombin during clotting. PAR1 and PAR2 activation cause bronchodilation in airway and may protect against asthma. PAR 4 activation by thrombin activates platelets during clotting and mice lacking PAR4 have impaired clotting and platelets that do not respond to thrombin signaling. The action of thrombin on PAR1 and PAR4 on platelets and endothelial cells may also contribute to vascular permeability and inflammation. Activated PARs appear to couple primarily through Gq-mediated stimulation of inositol phosphate metabolism and intracellular calcium levels to activate platelets. PAR1 and PAR4 also appear to couple to multiple G-proteins and transduce signals through more than one G-protein mediated pathway in some circumstances. Signaling by PAR1 and PAR4 through Galpha12 pathways couples to Rho signaling and changes in cytoskeletal structure and cell shape. Gi activation does not appear necessary for platelet activation by PAR1 or PAR4, and platelet activation by these receptors requires an ADP signal perhaps acting through the platelet-associated purinergic receptor P2Y12. Gi-coupled signaling may play a role in mitogenic PAR signaling in some settings through Map kinase activation. Activation of Rho by PAR1 can induce cellular transformation through a Galpha12 mediated mechanism and sustained rho-dependent phosphorylation of the myosin light chain by PAR1 contributes to cytoskeletal changes and activation of platelets.

One signaling pathway involved in regulating skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy is the AKT/mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway activity increases in response to muscle activity during hypertrophy and decreases in activity during atrophy. Blocking this pathway genetically or with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks hypertrophy and genetic activation of the pathway induces hypertrophy. One agent that promotes muscle hypertrophy is the growth factor IGF-1. IGF-1 activates AKT, GSK-3beta and mTOR to promote hypertrophy. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway is not involved in hypertrophy and is down-regulated by agents such as IGF-1 that promote hypertrophy. Calcineurin may modulate other aspects of muscle function such as the development of slow muscle fibers through transcriptional regulation. These pathways lead to regulation of protein translation, with increased translation apparently acting as a key regulatory point in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Agents such as IGF-1 that stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy may provide treatments for muscle atrophy and wasting."

Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders.

Inhibitory signals that block heart formation in anterior paraxial mesoderm include Wnt family members expressed in dorsal neural tube and anti-BMPs expressed in the axial tissues (i.e., noggin in the notochord). Wnt signalling pathway, which is essential for setting up the entire body pattern during embryonic development involves glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3 is active and phosphorylates b-catenin resulting in its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits GSK3, thereby preventing phosphorylation of b-catenin, which is then able to move to the nucleus. There it associates with members of the LEF-1/TCF family of transcription factors, which activate the transcription of genes like cyclin-D1, myc, and MMPs. The Wnt signaling pathway is blocked by a family of secreted proteins such as crescent and Dkk-1 sufficient for induction of heart formation in posterior mesoderm. BMP signaling can also be blocked by the BMP antagonists noggin and chordin, which are secreted from the notochord and cooperate with Wnts to prevent cardiogenesis. Receptors for BMPs, members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) superfamily, are persistently expressed during cardiac development, yet mice lacking type II or type IA BMP receptors die at gastrulation and cannot be used to assess potential later roles in creation of the heart. Activin receptor-like kinase 3 (ALK3) is specifically required at mid-gestation for normal development of the trabeculae, compact myocardium, interventricular septum, and endocardial cushion. Cardiac muscle lacking ALK3 is specifically deficient in expressing TGFb2, an established paracrine mediator of cushion morphogenesis. In humans, congenital heart defects occur with a prevalence of at least 1% in newborns, and are even more common in death before term. Most frequent are defects in septation and the cardiac valves, and few single gene etiologies are known. The invariable defects in myocardium and AV cushion resulting from congenital deletion of ALK3 provide strong support for its assessment as a candidate gene in human congenital heart disease."

The opioid receptors modulate pain signaling in response to endogenous peptide ligands and opiate drugs such as morphine. The kappa opioid receptor plays a key role in the profound analgesia of opiates and is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand dynorphin, encoded by the prodynorphin gene. Production of prodynorphin is transcriptionally regulated by a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the prodynorphin gene. A transcription factor called DREAM (DRE antagonistic modulator) binds to the DRE and represses prodynorphin transcription when bound. DREAM binds calcium with 4 EF-hand motifs and the binding of DREAM to DNA is repressed in the presence of calcium. Many transcription factors are regulated by calcium indirectly through calcium sensitive kinases and phosphatases, but DREAM is unique to date in being a transcription factor that directly binds calcium and is regulated by calcium binding. DREAM may also regulate other genes such as c-fos. DREAM is expressed in spinal cord neurons in regions involved in pain signaling. The regulation of prodynorphin expression by DREAM also leads to the hypothesis that DREAM is involved in pain signaling. Transgenic mice lacking the DREAM gene were unusually pain insensitive and had elevated spinal levels of dynorphin and tonic activation of the kappa opioid receptor, supporting this hypothesis. Other functions of DREAM may exist such as regulation of presenilins and potassium channel activity in the heart. DREAM is also known as calsenilin and KChIP3 through its association with these other proteins. These processes were not affected in mice lacking the DREAM gene however."

Presenilin-1 is also a component in gamma-secretase activity involved in signaling by the transmembrane protein Notch. Active gamma secretase requires PS-1 N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment and is unique in catalyzing proteolysis within the transmembrane region of proteins. Other proteins such as nicastrin may also be components of the gamma-secretase. Binding of the ligand Delta by Notch appears to trigger two proteolytic cleavages of Notch. The first step cleaves an extracellular domain and is catalyzed by a metalloprotease termed alpha-secretase or TACE. The second cleavage step appears to occur within the transmembrane domain of Notch, and releases a Notch intracellular doman (NICD). Once released, NICD moves into the nucleus where it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CSL family transcription factors (CBF1, Su(H), Lag-1) or other transcriptional regulators such as LEF-1. Presenilin is also involved in the Wnt/frizzled signaling pathway through beta-catenin. Beta-catenin is a cytoskeletal component that enters the nucleus to act as a transcriptional cofactor. Binding of WNT to Frizzled causes disheveled (DSH) to inhibit Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3b) activity. Phosphorylation of Beta-catenin induces the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of beta-catenin by the proteasome. Non-phosphorylated beta-catenin is stable and enters the nucleus to regulate transcription with TCF. The beta-catenin/TCF complex activates genes that promote cellular survival, proliferation and differentiation during development. Presenilin stimulates beta-catenin turnover, reducing its transcriptional activation."

This receptor is composed of three polypeptide chains, the alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2 receptor gamma chain is a common component for several other cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. The IL-2 receptor beta chain is essential for IL-2 signaling and is also a component of the IL-15 receptor complex. The polypeptides of the IL-2 receptor do not themselves have intrinsic catalytic activity, but interact with cytoplasmic signaling proteins to transduce signals. br>Different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor beta chain interact and couple with distinct signaling pathways and cellular responses. JAK1 associates with the beta chain, and JAK3 with the gamma chain. Binding of IL-2 induces heterodimerization of receptor subunits, and activation of JAK kinase activity. Tyrosine residues in the beta chain cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated during activation, recruiting other factors to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues through src homology 2 (SH2) domains. The adaptor protein Shc binds to phosphorylated tyrosine 338 of the beta chain. When bound, Shc is phosphorylated and couples through Grb2 and Sos-1 to activate Ras and stimulate T cell proliferation. Another key proliferative pathway activated by IL-2 is phosphorylation of STAT-5 by JAK kinases. STAT-5 is recruited to IL-2 beta phosphorylated tyrosines at multiple positions, including Y338, Y392 and Y510. Once phosphorylated, STAT-5 enters the nucleus to regulate the transcription of several genes, some proliferative such as cyclin genes and others that are involved in T cell immune function such as cytokine genes. The suppressors of cytokine activation, SOCS-3 and SOCS-1, oppose phosphorylation and activation of STAT-5 and JAK1 caused by IL-2. PI3 kinase is another protein recruited to IL-2 receptor beta chain tyrosines when phosphorylated. Activation of PI3 Kinase also contributes to the proliferative activity of IL-2 in T cells. The role of other tyrosines in the IL-2 receptor beta chain, Y355, Y358 and Y361, is not yet clear, but may be involved in signaling by the protein kinase p56lck. In addition to stimulating T cell activation and proliferation, IL-2 activation blocks T cell apoptosis through multiple pathways. Among the genes activated by STAT-5 are BCL-xL, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and fas-ligand, an activator of apoptosis in cells expressed the fas receptor.

The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK kinase, activation of Jun, and production of ceramide may also play roles in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Activation of fas-mediated apoptosis is opposed by I-FLICE and FAP.

Recently, protein methylation by CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) has been observed to play a key role in transcriptional regulation. CARM1 associates with the p160 class of transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by steroid hormone family receptors. CARM1 also interacts with CBP/p300 transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by a large variety of transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors and CEBP. One target of CARM1 is the core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets of the histone acetylase activity of CBP/p300 coactivators. Recruitment of CARM1 to the promoter region by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and makes promoter regions more accessible for transcription. Another target of CARM1 methylation is a coactivator it interacts with, CBP. Methylation of CBP by CARM1 blocks CBP from acting as a coactivator for CREB and redirects the limited CBP pool in the cell to be available for steroid hormone receptors. Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known. The methylation activity of CARM1 modulates the activity of specific transcriptional regulators. CARM1 acts as a coactivator for the myogenic transcription factor Mef2c, and is necessary for normal muscle cell differentiation. The estrogen receptor is another transcription factor that uses CARM1 as one of several coactivators, acting synergistically with CBP through the Grip1 member of the p160 family of coactivators.

The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import of fatty acids into mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I for oxidation and energy production. In the presence of leptin, AMPK is activated, ACC is inhibited, and malonyl-CoA levels fall, increasing the oxidation of fatty acids and reducing the lipid content of cells. The reduced lipid content in skeletal muscle allows insulin signaling and glucose consumption to return to their normal levels, reducing insulin resistance."

Melanogenesis is under complex regulatory control by multiple agents. The most important positive regulator of melanogenesis is the MC1 receptor with its ligands melanocortic peptides. MC1R activates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response-element binding protein (CREB). Increased expression of MITF and its activation by phosphorylation (P) stimulate the transcription of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), which produce melanin. Melanin synthesis takes place within specialized intracellular organelles named melanosomes.

The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex consisting of at least three proteins; IKK1/IKKa, IKK2/IKKb, and IKK3/IKKg. These enzymes phosphorylate IkB leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which is the best-studied activator binds to its receptor and recruits a protein called TNF receptor death domain (TRADD). TRADD binds to the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) that recruits NF-kB-inducible kinase (NIK). Both IKK1 and IKK2 have canonical sequences that can be phosphorylated by the MAP kinase NIK/MEKK1 and both kinases can independently phosphorylate IkBa or IkBb. TRAF-2 also interacts with A20, a zinc finger protein whose expression is induced by agents that activate NF-kB. A20 functions to block TRAF2-mediated NF-kB activation. A20 also inhibits TNF and IL-1 induced activation of NF-kB suggesting that it may act as a general inhibitor of NF-kB activation."

Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates activation of B cells and T cells through dephosphorylation of signaling factors. CD32 is a receptor for IgG Fc, and is also called FcgammaRII.

The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4+ T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD40 interaction with CD40L and CD28 interaction with CD80 provide positive costimulatory signals that stimulate B cell activation and proliferation. T cell receptor activation induces expression of molecules like the CD40 ligand that modulate the B cell-T cell interaction. The CD40-CD40L interaction induces cytokine production and expression of other genes and alters the fate of the B cell involved in the interaction. If the interaction between CD40 and CD40L is prolonged, the B cell can be induced to become a memory cell rather than a plasma cell. Fas ligand binding to Fas between B and T cells may negatively modulate B cell activation, inducing apoptosis that limits B cell proliferation and activation. Cytokines like IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 also play an important role in B cell activation."

Each of these cell types has a distinct role in the immune system, and communicates with other immune cells using secreted factors called cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, and the interferons. Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and are antigen-presenting cells, using cytokines to stimulate specific antigen dependent responses by B and T cells and non-specific responses by other cell types. T cells secrete a variety of factors to coordinate and stimulate immune responses to specific antigen, such as the role of helper T cells in B cell activation in response to antigen. The proliferation and activation of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils respond to cytokines as well. Cytokine communication is often local, within a tissue or between cells in close proximity. Each of the cytokines is secreted by one set of cells and provokes a response in another target set of cells, often including the cell that secretes the cytokine. Some cytokines, like IL-1, interferons and TNF, stimulate a broad inflammatory response in response to infection or injury. Other cytokines have more specific functions such the following examples. IL-2 stimulates the proliferation and activation of B and T cells. IL-4 plays a role in the differentiation of Th2 cells, in allergic responses, and in the switching of antibody types. IL-5 stimulates the production and maturation of eosinophils during inflammation. IL-8 is a chemokine, a chemotactic factor that attracts neutrophils, basophils and T cells to sites of inflammation. IL-12 and IL-18 are involved in helper T cell differentiation. IL-10 apparently acts to repress secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.

Presumably, these breast cancers become estrogen independent through genetic alterations that bypass the requirement for ER-dependent stimulation of cell proliferation. As such estrogen receptor is a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelia and represents a crucial prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression through direct gene activation of a number of genes (cathepsin D, HSP27 (heat shock protein 27,000 kDa, aldolase A, dehydrogenase, alpha-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphat, Pdzk1, Greb ets) and also through the biological functions of target loci. The product of human MTA3 has been identified as an estrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2/NuRD transcriptional corepressor in breast epithelial cells and demonstrate that MTA3 constitutes a key component of an estrogen-dependent pathway regulating growth and differentiation. The absence of estrogen receptor or of MTA3 leads to aberrant expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Aberrant Snail expression results in loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, an event associated with changes in epithelial architecture and invasive growth.

The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in platelet activation. Clustering Eph kinases or ephrins in platelets stimulated cytoskeletal changes as well as other markers of platelet activation during clotting such as secretion of alpha-granules to release clotting factors. Clustering ephrins together activated Rap1b, a ras gene family member that may regulate integrins. Platelet activation caused Eph kinases to bind to src family members Fyn and Lyn and also with the cell adhesion molecule L1. Failure of the ephrins/Eph kinase pathway to function normally in platelets may result in loosely associated platelets and improper clot formation.

The role of cdk5 in dopamine responses occurs through phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Caseine kinase 1 (CK1) also regulates DARPP-32 phosphorylation and dopamine signaling. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by cdk5 reduced dopamine signaling. Depending on its phosphorylation state, DARPP-32 inhibits either protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or PKA. The role of mGLUR1 in this process is supported by the induction of cdk5 and CK1 activity by the mGLUR1 agonist DHPG and the subsequent phosphorylation of DARPP-32 associated with DHPG treatment of nigrostriatal neurons. CK-1 and Ckd5 inhibitors block the DHPG induced DARPP-32 phosphorylation. Dopamine exerts a positive signal that increases dopamine response by reversing phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at threonine-75. Dopamine initiates this pathway through activation of the D1 dopamine receptor, a Gs coupled GPCR, elevating cAMP and activating PKA. PKA activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which dephosphorylates DARPP-32 and increases dopamine responsiveness.

Tissue injury stimulates the release of inflammatory signaling molecules such as bradykinin. Bacterial infection stimulates an immune response in several ways. Bacteria that are phagocytosed can activate macrophages, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. Bacteria can also activate the complement cascade through either the antibody-mediated pathway (classical pathway) or the alternative complement pathway. In extravascular tissues, cells that respond to infection or injury include macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages and other immune cells secrete chemokines that recruit leukocytes from the circulation to the site of inflammation. Mast cells release histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes that act as chemokines, increase vascular permeability, and act on the vascular endothelium to increase tissue recruitment of leukocytes. Chemokines can recruit leukocytes or lymphocytes out of the blood stream into tissues and make blood vessels more permeable. Leukocytes are activated by inflammatory signals to express adhesion molecules that cause them to interact with the vascular endothelium, penetrate the endothelial wall and migrate into the extracellular space of tissues. The combined response of immune cells and signaling molecules at the site of inflammation induces swelling, activation of immune cells, and clearance of potential infectious agents. Chronic inflammation can however also lead to tissue damage in conditions such as arthritis, in which anti-inflammatory drugs act on various steps in inflammation to prevent disease."

The majority of RhoA activations is due to disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell morphology. RhoA is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. The RhoGAP ARHGAP1 also acts as a GAP for Rac and CDC42. Active RhoA increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several different factors downstream of RhoA act on cytoskeletal structures to affect stability of these structures. Rock1 provides a direct link from RhoA to cell morphology through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Rock1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses this activity. According to Nimnual et al. Rho activity is reduced as a result of Rac-induced redox-dependent inhibition. Related Disease: Non-syndromic deafness appears to be the result of amino acid substitutions in the 52-amino acid C-terminal end of Dia 1.

TNF RI contains a cytoplasmic DD required for signaling pathways associated with apoptosis and NF-kB activation.2,3 Jiang et al.4 identified a widely expressed 60 kDa protein, named SODD (silencer of death domains), associated with the DD of TNF RI and DR3. Overexpression of SODD suppresses TNF-induced cell death and NF-kB activation demonstrating its role as a negative regulatory protein for these signaling pathways. TNF-induced receptor trimerization aggregates the DD of TNF RI and recruits the adapter protein TRADD.3,5 This in turn promotes the recruitment of the DD-containing cytoplasmic proteins FADD, TRAF2 and RIP to form an active TNF RI signaling complex (Figure 1A).6-9 In contrast, SODD acts as a silencer of TNF RI signaling and does not interact with TRADD, FADD, or RIP (Figure 1B).4 It is associated with the DD of TNF RI and maintains TNF RI in an inactive, monomeric state. TNF-induced aggregation of TNF RI promotes the disruption of the SODD-TNF RI complex. SODD does not interact with the DD of other TNF receptor superfamily members such as Fas, DR4, DR5, or TNF RII.

Homologous desensitization of GPCRs (1) results from the binding of -arrestins (-arr) to agonist -occupied receptors following phosphorylation of the receptor by GRKs. -arrestin binding sterically precludes coupling between the receptor and heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to termination of signaling by G proteins effectors. Receptor-bound -arrestins also act as adapter proteins, binding to components of the clathrin endocytic machinery including clathrin, 2-adaptin (AP-2). Receptor sequestration (2) reflects the dynamin (Dyn)-dependent endocytosis of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits. Once internalized, GPCRs exhibit two distinct patterns of -arrestin interaction. `Class A' GPCRs, for example the 2 adrenergic receptor, rapidly dissociate from -arrestin upon internalization. These receptors are trafficked to an acidified endosomal compartment, wherein the ligand is dissociated and the receptor dephosphorylated by a GPCR-specific protein phosphatase PP2A isoform, and are subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane (3). `Class B' receptors, for example the angiotensin II AT1a receptor, form stable receptor--arrestin complexes.

During mitosis, chromatin is condensed for segregation of chromosomes, while for transcription chromatin is more open. The nuclear matrix, or scaffold, is a protein network in the nucleus providing structure and regulating chromatin condensation. Regulated interactions of matrix proteins with each other, DNA and other factors in different phases of the cell cycle alter the structure and function of chromatin. AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein) is a nuclear matrix associated protein that also binds DNA and different proteins during different phases of the cell cycle. The interaction of AKAP95 with DNA and proteins alters the condensation and transcription of chromatin. A specific domain of AKAP95 regulates its interaction with the nuclear matrix and another regulates its association with DNA. One key protein that AKAP95 interacts with is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. AKAP95 binds to PKA through a PKA RII regulatory subunit, an interaction that requires PKA phosphorylation by Cdk1. PKA activity and cAMP are reduced during entry into mitosis, but PKA recruited by AKAP95 to condensed chromosomes is essential to maintain the condensed state. Another protein recruited by AKAP95 is Eg7, a 150 kD protein recruited during mitotic chromatin condensation. Eg7 is a part of a multiprotein condensin complex, recruiting another key component of mitotic chromatin condensation. Modification of the core histones through phosphorylation regulates chromatin condensation. Histone H3 interacts with the condensin complex, and is phosphorylated during mitosis. Histone H3 phosphorylation by Aurora-2 induces chromatin condensation, and dephosphorylation by PP1 promotes chromatin decondensation for reentry into interphase. AKAP95 may play a role during the regulation of chromatin structure for transcription during interphase as well. The interaction of AKAP95 with the p68 RNA helicase recruits this enzyme to the nuclear matrix during interphase.

Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric restriction. Although dwarf mice with defective growth hormone or IGF-1 signaling also have significantly increased lifespan, humans with defects in growth hormone signaling tend to develop diseases that shorten their lifespan. One of the downstream targets of IGF-1 signaling is to repress stress resistance proteins including antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, and heat shock proteins, so a reduction in IGF signaling may extend lifespan by increasing the expression of stress resistance genes. The link between caloric restriction and IGF signaling may be that a reduction in food intake reduces the expression of IGF-1, increasing the expression of stress resistance proteins. In addition to the IGF-1R mutation, p66 Shc mutation also increases lifespan without significant aberration of other systems. Shc is a target of IGF-1R phosphorylation, and a major inducer of cellular responses to oxidative stress. Shc increases levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, repressing the forkhead factor FKHRL1. Alhtough FKHRL1 is also involved in apoptosis, in the absence of Shc, FKHRL1 mediates increased resistance to oxidative stress.

Calpains digests the links between the actin cytoskeleton and several focal adhesion complex proteins; talin, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. The release from the focal adhesion complex facilitates migration. Calpestatin is an inhibitor expressed in most cells. Calpestatin binds the four inhibitory domains of calpain. Release from calpestatin does not activate calpain. Activation requires additional signaling, coactivators and an appropriate calcium concentration. During cell migration calpain1 (mu-calpain) acts at the leading edge as a response to integrin signals or calcium fluxuations due to the stretch activated calcium channels. Calpain1 cleaves the target proteins, talin, exzrin, paxillin and the cytoplasmic tail of the integrins B1(a) and B3(b) to release the adhesion and form new adhesions. Calpain2 (M-calpain) is believed to be membrane bound and functions at the trailing edge of the migrating cell to cleave the integrins in response to growth factor receptor signals. PKA functions to down regulate or inhibit calpain2. Disease related notes: In Alzheimers disease, amyloid peptides interfere with calpain activity causing a mislocalization of cdk5.

Mutations or altered expression of these proteins contributes to PD pathogenesis through common mechanisms that result in proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress. Point mutations in alpha-synuclein and the recently described Iowan functional duplication of alpha-synuclein lead to excessive intracellular accumulation and protofibril formation. Decrease in the amount of soluble alpha-synuclein tends to increase free cytoplasmic dopamine and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, formation of protofibrils or aggregates and Lewy bodies (LBs) diminishes the availability of the physiological forms of alpha-synuclein, favoring an increase in TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) and DAT (dopamine transporter), but diminishes vesicles formation and neuronal plasticity.

A closely studied Map kinase cascade originates with tyrosine kinase activation, and activation of Ras. Ras activates Raf, Raf activates the Map kinase kinases Mek1 and Mek2 and these kinases activate downstream Map kinases like Erk1 and Erk2. Erk1 and Erk2 in turn activate transgenes like p35 through the Map kinase activated transcription factor EGR-1. Mek1 plays a central role in many different Map kinase pathways. Factors that activate Mek1 include growth factors like NGF, cytokines, chemokines, and phorbol ester, resulting in cellular proliferation and survival. Mek1 activation may also play a role in differentiation in neuronal tissues. In cultured neuronal PC-12 cells, NGF induces neurite outgrowth via Mek1 and the map kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of Mek1 can transform cells and may play a role in cancer. The crucial role of Mek1 in a variety of pathways including cellular transformation suggests that the cell must tightly regulate its activity. Cdk5 is a kinase that regulates the activity of Mek1. Although Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase gene family, the activity of Cdk5 does not appear to be regulated by cyclins, but is activated by association with p35. Cdk5 does not act as a checkpoint kinase to regulate cell cycle progression, but acts as a regulatory kinase involved in other post-mitotic processes such as neuronal activity such as neuronal migration during development and neurite outgrowth. Mice lacking Cdk5 exhibit defects in neuronal development. One target of Cdk5 is Mek1. Phosphorylation of Mek1 by Cdk5 represses Mek1 activity and blocks downstream cellular responses. The activation of p35 by Map kinase pathways followed by deactivation of Map kinase signaling by the Cdk5/p35 complex completes the loop of a feedback circuit to terminate Map kinase signaling."

Multiple signal transduction pathways have been shown to be involved in this process. Activation of PFs terminating on spines in dendritic branchlets leads to glutamate release and activation of both AMPA and mGluRs. Activation of CFs, which make multiple synaptic contacts on proximal dendrites, also via AMPA receptors, opens voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and causes a generalized influx of calcium. These cellular signals, generated from two different synaptic origins, trigger a cascade of events culminating in a phosphorylation-dependent, long-term reduction in AMPA receptor sensitivity at the PF-PC synapse. This may take place either through receptor internalization and/or through receptor desensitization."

Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML.

In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated."

Unlike DNA damage, hypoxia does not induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, suggesting that p53 activity is differentially regulated by these two stresses. Hypoxia induces p53 protein accumulation, but in contrast to DNA damage, hypoxia fails to induce endogenous downstream p53 effector mRNAs and proteins, such as p21, Bax, CIP1, WAF1 etc. Hypoxia does not inhibit the induction of p53 target genes by ionizing radiation, indicating that p53-dependent transactivation requires a DNA damage-inducible signal that is lacking under hypoxic treatment alone. The phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. Mdm-2 targets the p53 tumor suppressor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome, but, in addition, the p53 transcription factor induces Mdm-2, thus, establishing a feedback loop. Hypoxia or DNA damage by abrogating binding of HIF-1 with VHL and p53 with Mdm-2, respectively, leads to stabilization and accumulation transcriptionally active HIF-1 and p53. At the molecular level, DNA damage induces the interaction of p53 with the transcriptional activator p300 as well as with the transcriptional corepressor mSin3A. In contrast, hypoxia primarily induces an interaction of p53 with mSin3A, but not with p300."

In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. Generally, lymphocyte adhesion and passage from the bloodstream to the lymphatic system occurs in the high endothelial venules of the lymphnodes. This way the lymphocytes can communicate with each other in the lymphatic system and search for foreign compounds after their recirculation to the bloodstream, this fulfilling their role in the immune system. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3.

The alpha transcript of CDKN2A has been shown to encode p16(INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the RB protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A encodes p14(ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14(ARF) is shorter than the corresponding mouse protein, p19(ARF), and the 2 proteins share only 50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53 response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A and MDM2, and resulting in a distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2/M phases. Two unrelated proteins encoded by the INK4A-ARF locus function in tumor suppression. ARF binds to MDM2 and promotes the rapid degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the E1-beta-encoded N-terminal domain of ARF and a C-terminal region of MDM2. ARF-promoted MDM2 degradation is associated with MDM2 modification and concurrent p53 stabilization and accumulation. The p19(Arf) tumor suppressor inhibits production of ribosomal RNA, retarding processing of 47/45S and 32S precursors. These effects correlate with but do not strictly depend upon inhibition of rRNA biosynthesis or cell cycle arrest, are not mimicked by p53, and require neither p53 nor Mdm2. Arf mutants lacking conserved amino acid residues 2-14 do not block rRNA synthesis and processing or inhibit cell proliferation. Evolution may have linked a primordial nucleolar Arf function to Mdm2 and p53, creating a more efficient checkpoint-signaling pathway for coordinating ribosomal biogenesis and cell cycle progression."

BRCA1 and BRCA2 induce double-stranded repair of breaks using homologous recombination, in part through activation of RAD51. BRCA1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase targeting the protein FancD2 that activates checkpoint control, integrating the ATM response to ionizing radiation and the FA response to cross-linking agents like mitomycin C. Mutation of one of the several components of the FA complex involved in maintaining integrity of the genome leads to the condition Fanconi anemia. One member of the FA complex was recently identified as BRCA2, which leads to Fanconi anemia when both copies of the gene are mutated. Another related factor involved in the response of cells to DNA damage is the kinase ATM. ATM is mutated in patients with AT, a condition with many similar traits to Fanconi anemia. Like ATM, ATR serves as a checkpoint kinase that halts cell cycle progression and induces DNA repair when DNA is damaged. Loss of ATR results in a loss of checkpoint control in response to DNA damage, leading to cell death, and deletion of the ATR gene in mice is embryonic lethal. ATRIP is a protein that interacts with ATR and is a substrate for its kinase activity. ATRIP is required for ATR function, and removal of ATRIP also leads to a loss of checkpoint control of the cell cycle. ATR and ATM kinase targets include repair enzymes like Rad51, and the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2, as well as BRCA1 and BRCA2. The close relationship of the genes involved in breast cancer and Fanconi anemia has helped illuminate this signaling system, and may help lead to improved understanding and treatment of these conditions."

Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit GalNAc(b1-4)GlcA(b1-3), modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates. CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues. The assembly process of CS is initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization step is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both b13 glucuronosyltransferase and b14 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O sulfation and 6-O sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues.
