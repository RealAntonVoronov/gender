BIOCARTA_41BB_PATHWAY,The 4-1BB-dependent immune response,"The activation of T cells requires a co-stimulatory signal with T cell receptor activation, provided in many cases by activation of CD28 in resting T cells. 4-1BB (CD137) is a member of the TNF receptor gene family that provides another T cell co-stimulatory signal. 4-1BB is expressed by activated cytotoxic and helper T cells and its expression is induced by a variety of T cell stimuli, including activation of the T cell receptor or stimulation with mitogens. The ligand for 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is induced on activated antigen-presenting cells including macrophages, activating T cells expressing 4-1BB. Mice lacking 4-1BB survive and have an altered though functional immune response. T cells of mice lacking 4-1BB proliferate more rapidly than normal T cells, but have reduced cytokine secretion. The costimulatory signal provided by 4-1BB may act in combination with CD28 activation to prolong the T cell response, and may also act independently of CD28. Stimulation of T cells with the 4-1BB ligand may provide a therapeutic immune response in the treatment of cancer or viral infection. 4-1BB in T cells activates several signaling pathways. Like other members of the TNF receptor family, the 4-1BB receptor does not have an intrinsic kinase activity. TRAF2 is a signaling adapter that mediates signaling by other members of the TNF receptor family and that also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of ligand activated 4-1BB to activate intracellular kinase cascades. TRAF1 also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of 4-1BB although with lower affinity than TRAF2. One downstream effector activated by 4-1BB through TRAF2 is the transcription factor NF-kB. 4-1BB also activates map kinase pathways, including p38 and JNK activation. ASK1 dependent pathways can activate both p38 and JNK, and dominant negative ASK1 blocks their activation. Other kinase pathways may also be involved in 4-1BB activation of p38 and JNK, such as activation of germinal center kinase (GCK) or related kinases involved in activation of JNK and p38 by TNF. Map kinase activation along with NF-kB activation results in transcriptional activation of cytokine genes involved in T cell activation and signaling. The co-stimulatory signaling provided by 4-1BB shares some features with CD28 signaling, providing an explanation for the ability of 4-1BB to replace the CD28 costimulatory signal in some settings."
BIOCARTA_ACE2_PATHWAY,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 regulates heart function,"Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would appear that ACE 2 inhibits the formation of angiotensin and reduces blood pressure increases. Crackower et al determined that ace2 -/- mice suffered significant heart defects at 6 months. Further deletion of ACE resulted in restored cardiac functions."

BIOCARTA_ACH_PATHWAY,Role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the regulation of apoptosis,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are essential for neuromuscular signaling and are also expressed in non-neuronal tissues, where their function is less clear. Although nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are primarily known for their action as ligand-gated ion channels transducing action potentials across synapses, they may have other actions. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in neurons alter apoptotic signaling, protecting against cell death in some settings, and this action may in some cases be directed through alternative signaling pathways. In neurons the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor activates PI3 kinase through a src-family kinase, activating the anti-apoptotic kinase AKT. One pathway involved in AKT signaling involves phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, causing its retention in the cytoplasm associated with 14-3-3, and blocking expression of the apoptotic fas protein. The PI3 kinase/AKT pathway protects a broad range of neurons against apoptotic cell death and may block apoptosis triggered by beta-amyloid fragments that contributes to the progression of Alzheimers disease. If so, nicotinic agents may prove useful in the treatment of this and other neurodegenerative conditions. There are several proteins that modulate the response of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, include synapse formation. Prior to synapse formation, nicotinic receptors are randomly dispersed in the post-synaptic membrane. A neuronal protein, agrin, binds to the Musk receptor in the muscle membrane, stimulating clustering of nicotinic receptors and synapse formation. Rapsyn is present at high levels at synapses with nicotinic receptors, bringing them together at high densities and anchoring clustered receptors to the cytoskeleton. Members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases also play a role in clustering caused by Rapsyn, phosphorylating the nicotinic receptors, rapsyn, and other targets. Nicotinic receptors expressed in non-neuronal tissues may also be involved in the response to smoking. In lung epithelial cells, nicotine from cigarette smoke blocks apoptosis by activating the anti-apoptotic kinase AKT, contributing perhaps to carcinogenesis and resistance to chemotherapy. Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in dermal fibroblasts may contribute to the altered wound healing and skin elasticity related to smoking. Activation of keratinocyte nicotinic receptors may also alter the properties of skin."
BIOCARTA_ACTINY_PATHWAY,Y branching of actin filaments,"Mammalian cell motility requires actin polymerization in the direction of movement to change membrane shape and extend cytoplasm into lamellipodia. The polymerization of actin to drive cell movement also involves branching of actin filaments into a network oriented with the growing ends of the fibers near the cell membrane. Manipulation of this process helps bacteria like Salmonella gain entry into cells they infect. Two of the proteins involved in the formation of Y branches and in cell motility are Arp2 and Arp3, both members of a large multiprotein complex containing several other polypeptides as well. The Arp2/3 complex is localized at the Y branch junction and induces actin polymerization. Activity of this complex is regulated by multiple different cell surface receptor signaling systems, activating WASP, and Arp2/3 in turn to cause changes in cell shape and cell motility. Wasp and its cousin Wave-1 interact with the Arp2/3 complex through the p21 component of the complex. The crystal structure of the Arp2/3 complex has revealed further insights into the nature of how the complex works. Activation by Wave-1, another member of the WASP family, also induces actin alterations in response to Rac1 signals upstream. Wave-1 is held in an inactive complex in the cytosol that is activated to allow Wave-1 to associate with Arp2/3. While WASP is activated by interaction with Cdc42, Wave-1, is activated by interaction with Rac1 and Nck. Wave-1 activation by Rac1 and Nck releases Wave-1 with Hspc300 to activate actin Y branching and polymerization by Arp2/3. Different members of this gene family may produce different actin cytoskeletal architectures. The immunological defects associated with mutation of the WASP gene, the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome for which WASP was named, indicates the importance of this system for normal cellular function."
BIOCARTA_AGPCR_PATHWAY,Attenuation of GPCR Signaling,"The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family transduces extracellular signals across the plasma membrane, activating cellular responses through a variety of second messenger cascades. These receptors provide rapid responses to a variety of stimuli, and are often rapidly attenuated in their signaling. Failure to attenuate GPCR signaling can have dramatic consequences. One method to attenuate GPCR signaling is by removal of the stimulus from the extracellular fluid. At the synapse, removal of neurotransmitter or peptide signaling molecules is accomplished by either reuptake or degradation. Acetylcholine is removed from synapses through degradation by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase results in prolonged signaling at the neuromuscular junction, and uncontrollable spasms in humans caused by nerve gas or in insects by some insecticides. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is also used therapeutically to treat Alzheimer's disease, compensating for the loss of cholinergic neurons. Transporters for serotonin, dopamine, GABA and noradrenaline remove these neurotransmitters from the synapse to terminate signaling. Antidepressants such as Prozac inhibit reuptake of serotonin and many drugs of abuse such as cocaine act by blocking reuptake of dopamine or adrenaline. Reuptake not only terminates signaling, but can also conserve neurotransmitter through recycling back into the presynaptic cell. The next step in the attenuation of GPCR signaling is receptor desensitization, in which receptors are modified to no longer transduce a signal even if the stimulus is still present. Desensitization of GPCRs occurs through protein kinases that phosphorylate the GPCR to turn off signaling. Downstream protein kinases such as PKA and PKC turned on by GPCR signaling can phosphorylate the activated GPCR and other GPCRs to prevent further signaling. G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) are a family of kinases that specifically phosphorylate only agonist-occupied GPCRs. GRKs attenuate GPCR signaling in concert with arrestins, proteins that bind GRK-phosphorylated GPCRs to disrupt interaction with G-protein and to terminate signaling. Reducing the number of receptor expressed on the cell surface can also attenuate receptor signaling. Many GPCRs are removed from the cell surface by receptor-mediated endocytosis when they are activated. Endocytosis of activated GPCRs appears to be stimulated by GRKs and arrestins. Once internalized, receptors can either be degraded in lysosomes or they can be recycled back to the cell surface."
BIOCARTA_AGR_PATHWAY,Agrin in Postsynaptic Differentiation,"The heparan sulphate proteoglycan agrin is well known as the key assembly factor of postsynaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), but recent data suggest it also plays a direct role in the organization of the cytoskeleton in the skeletal muscle. Signaling through muscle-specific proteins such as muscle specific kinase (MuSK) and or acetylcholine receptor (AchRs)/rapsyn, agrin can activate ubiquitously expressed Rac, Cdc42, and p21-activated kinase (PAK) that are involved in actin polymerization. Agrin also engages signaling pathways of several potent oncogenes (i.e., SFK, ErbB receptors, and cortactin)."
BIOCARTA_AHSP_PATHWAY,Hemoglobin's Chaperone,"The function of hemoglobin in oxygen transport by red blood cells requires precise assembly of a tetramer of two beta-subunits and two alpha-units. If too many beta-subunits are present, then all tetramers of beta-subunits are formed that bind oxygen but do not release it when needed. When alpha-subunits are in excess they form precipitates with oxidized heme that damage red blood cells. Red blood cells require a precise coregulation of alpha and beta subunit expression to maintain the proper ratio of the subunits and normal red blood cell function. Generally red blood cells express slightly more alpha than beta-subunits to avoid forming unproductive beta-tetramers (HbH). The slight excess of alpha units are blocked from precipitation by a molecular chaperone, AHSP, alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein. Expression of the AHSP gene is coordinately activated with the globin genes and heme biosynthesis genes by the GATA-1 gene involved in erythrocyte differentiation. AHSP blocks precipitation of alpha-units, and promotes the formation of normal productive alpha-beta tetramers (HbA). People with mutation or deletion of the beta-subunit gene have Beta-thalassemias resulting from an over-abundance of alpha subunits and their precipitation. The severity of the phenotype may depend on the AHSP genotype of these individuals and elevating AHSP levels through gene therapy may provide a treatment strategy for beta-thalassemia."
BIOCARTA_AKAP13_PATHWAY,Rho-Selective Guanine Exchange Factor AKAP13 Mediates Stress Fiber Formation,"The A-kinase anchor protein 13 (AKAP13, also known as AKAP-LBC) is one of a group of structurally diverse proteins, which have the common function of binding to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell. AKAP13 is a splice variant of the oncogene Lbc. Alternative splicing of the AKAP13 gene results in at least 3 transcript variants encoding different isoforms containing a Dbl oncogene homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain is associated with guanine nucleotide exchange activation for the Rho/Rac family of small GTP binding proteins, resulting in the conversion of the inactive GTPase to the active form capable of transducing signals. The PH domain has multiple functions. These splice variants contain a fragment that was originally identified as Ht31 which acts as a scaffolding protein to regulate the Rho signaling pathway and as protein kinase A-anchoring protein creating a coordination of these two signalling pathways. Diviani et al. found that in HEK293 cells LPA induced stimulation preferentially activates AKAP13 via G-alpha12. As yet targets for the anchored PKA have not been identified. AKAP13 and Rho do not appear to be phosphorylated by PKA. Diviani et al also found that the Lbc oncogene and protooncogene splice variant show higher activation and stress fiber localization. This appears to be a result of the presence of N terminal inhibitory sequences. A similar model of regulation has been proposed for Dbl and Vav."
BIOCARTA_AKAP95_PATHWAY,AKAP95 role in mitosis and chromosome dynamics,"The chromatin packaging of the genome is dynamic, changing with the cell cycle and with transcriptional regulation. During mitosis, chromatin is condensed for segregation of chromosomes, while for transcription chromatin is more open. The nuclear matrix, or scaffold, is a protein network in the nucleus providing structure and regulating chromatin condensation. Regulated interactions of matrix proteins with each other, DNA and other factors in different phases of the cell cycle alter the structure and function of chromatin. AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein) is a nuclear matrix associated protein that also binds DNA and different proteins during different phases of the cell cycle. The interaction of AKAP95 with DNA and proteins alters the condensation and transcription of chromatin. A specific domain of AKAP95 regulates its interaction with the nuclear matrix and another regulates its association with DNA. One key protein that AKAP95 interacts with is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. AKAP95 binds to PKA through a PKA RII regulatory subunit, an interaction that requires PKA phosphorylation by Cdk1. PKA activity and cAMP are reduced during entry into mitosis, but PKA recruited by AKAP95 to condensed chromosomes is essential to maintain the condensed state. Another protein recruited by AKAP95 is Eg7, a 150 kD protein recruited during mitotic chromatin condensation. Eg7 is a part of a multiprotein condensin complex, recruiting another key component of mitotic chromatin condensation. Modification of the core histones through phosphorylation regulates chromatin condensation. Histone H3 interacts with the condensin complex, and is phosphorylated during mitosis. Histone H3 phosphorylation by Aurora-2 induces chromatin condensation, and dephosphorylation by PP1 promotes chromatin decondensation for reentry into interphase. AKAP95 may play a role during the regulation of chromatin structure for transcription during interphase as well. The interaction of AKAP95 with the p68 RNA helicase recruits this enzyme to the nuclear matrix during interphase. Other nuclear RNA helicases interact with transcription factors and cofactors, suggesting that the p68 RNA helicase also may regulate interactions of transcription complexes."
BIOCARTA_AKAPCENTROSOME_PATHWAY,Protein Kinase A at the Centrosome,"Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha (PKA-RIIa) is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP350 (also known as AKAP450 and CGNAP), MAP2 and Pericentrin. This diagram illustrates these three PKA-RII binding complexes. The cyclin B-p34(cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate PKA-RIIa on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of PKA-RIIa at the on set of mitosis. It has been demonstrated that PKA-RIIa dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The focal point of this illustration is the AKAP350 complex. In addition to binding PKA-RIIa, AKAP350 binds PKN (Takahashi et al 1999) and the phosphatases PP1 and PPA2 (Takahashi et al 1999). PKN is a serine/threonine protein kinase, having a catalytic domain homologous to the PKC family in the C-terminal region and a unique regulatory region in the N-terminal region. PKN is activated by a small GTPase RhoA and unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid. The binding of both kinases and phophatases by the same scaffold protein provides a focal point where physiological events, such as cell cycle progression and intracellular membrane traffic, may be regulated by phosphorylation state of specific protein substrates. There are at least 4 isoforms of AKAP350 which lead to the possibility that they may behave differently at different subcellular locations. MAP2 is a member of a group of proteins that provide microtubule stabilization. MAP2 affinity appears to be dependent on PKA phosphorylation of MAP2. Pericentrin is also an AKAP (Diviani and Scott). Pericentrin binds Dynein which is also regulated by PKA leading to the possibility that pericentrin positions PKA to regulate dynein function (Diviani and Scott). Another example of AKAP/PKA interaction is illustrated in the AKAP95 role in mitosis and chromosome dynamics pathway."
BIOCARTA_AKT_PATHWAY,AKT Signaling Pathway,"Many cell-surface receptors induce production of second messengers like PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, that convey signals to the cytoplasm from the cell surface. PIP3 signals activates the kinase PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, which in turn activates the kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B. Proteins phosphorylated by activated AKT promote cell survival. Phosphorylation of Ikappa-B kinase leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-kB to oppose apoptosis. Bad is a protein in the Bcl-2 gene family that opposes Bcl-2 to induce apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Bad by AKT blocks anti-apoptotic activity to promote cell survival. Similarly, phosphorylation of the protease caspase 9 or forkhead transcription factors by AKT block the induction of apoptosis by these factors. AKT promotes cell survival and opposes apoptosis by a variety of routes."
BIOCARTA_ALK_PATHWAY,ALK in cardiac myocytes,"Heart formation is cued by a combination of positive and negative signals from surrounding tissues. Inhibitory signals that block heart formation in anterior paraxial mesoderm include Wnt family members expressed in dorsal neural tube and anti-BMPs expressed in the axial tissues (i.e., noggin in the notochord). Wnt signalling pathway, which is essential for setting up the entire body pattern during embryonic development involves glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3 is active and phosphorylates b-catenin resulting in its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits GSK3, thereby preventing phosphorylation of b-catenin, which is then able to move to the nucleus. There it associates with members of the LEF-1/TCF family of transcription factors, which activate the transcription of genes like cyclin-D1, myc, and MMPs. The Wnt signaling pathway is blocked by a family of secreted proteins such as crescent and Dkk-1 sufficient for induction of heart formation in posterior mesoderm. BMP signaling can also be blocked by the BMP antagonists noggin and chordin, which are secreted from the notochord and cooperate with Wnts to prevent cardiogenesis. Receptors for BMPs, members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) superfamily, are persistently expressed during cardiac development, yet mice lacking type II or type IA BMP receptors die at gastrulation and cannot be used to assess potential later roles in creation of the heart. Activin receptor-like kinase 3 (ALK3) is specifically required at mid-gestation for normal development of the trabeculae, compact myocardium, interventricular septum, and endocardial cushion. Cardiac muscle lacking ALK3 is specifically deficient in expressing TGFb2, an established paracrine mediator of cushion morphogenesis. In humans, congenital heart defects occur with a prevalence of at least 1% in newborns, and are even more common in death before term. Most frequent are defects in septation and the cardiac valves, and few single gene etiologies are known. The invariable defects in myocardium and AV cushion resulting from congenital deletion of ALK3 provide strong support for its assessment as a candidate gene in human congenital heart disease."

BIOCARTA_AMI_PATHWAY,Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Myocardial infraction (MI)is the condition of irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle that results from prolonged ischemia. Nearly 1.5 million people in US sustain an MI each year, and this event proves fatal in approximately one third of patients. Approximately 90% of MI result from formation of an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The thrombus transforms a region of plaque narrowing to one of complete vessel occlusion (top right in pink). The responsible thrombus appears to be generated by interactions between the atherosclerotic plaque, the coronary endothelium, circulating platelets, and dynamic vasomotor tone of the vessel wall, all of which overwhelm natural protective mechanisms. The endogenous protective mechanisms against thrombosis include: 1. Inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III (ATIII), the effectiveness of which is enhanced by binding of ATIII to heparin sulafate. The antithrombin binding region of commercial heparin consists of sulfated disaccharide units (bottom panel). 2. Inactivation of clotting factors Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (protein C*), an action that is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombomodulin (TM)-thrombin complex. 3. Inactivation of factor VII/tissue factor complex by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Coumarin drugs (Warfarin) blocks the g-carboxylation of Glu residues in prothrombin and factors VII, IX and X which results in incomplete molecules that are biologically inactive in coagulation (left panel). 4. Lysis of fibrin clots by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). 5. Inhibition of platelet activation by prostacyclin and EDRF-NO. Platelets adhere to exposed collagen and are activated at the site of endothelial damage in the blood vessel. Activated platelets release adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin (5-HT), and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which activate additional platelets. Binding of thrombin further activates the platelets. Three adjoining platelets are shown in the process of viscous metamorphosis (top right). Increased cellular Ca2+ facilitates binding of fibrinogen. If the intraluminal thrombus at the site of plaque disruption totally occludes the vessel, blood flow beyond the obstruction will cease, prolonged ischemia will occur and MI (usually Q-wave MI) will likely result."
BIOCARTA_ARAP_PATHWAY,ADP-Ribosylation Factor,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, members of the Ras GTPase superfamily that were initially recognized and purified because of their ability to stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the cholera toxin A subunit. We now know that they are critical components of several different vesicular trafficking pathways in all eukaryotic cells and activators of specific phospholipase Ds (PLDs) (reviewed in Refs. 13). ARF interacts with many proteins and other molecules that regulate its state of activation or are involved in its intracellular function. Arf proteins cycle between GDP-bound, inactive and GTP-bound, active forms, and the cycling is regulated by specific GEPs and GAPs. Members of the Arf GEP family can be grouped into two major subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities and functional differences. The high-molecular-weight Arf GEP subfamily includes yeast Sec7, Gea1, and Gea2, and mammalian BIG1/p200, BIG2, and GBF1, which all consist of 1,400 2,000 amino acid residues. Many Arf GAPs are multidomain proteins and have been found to interact with multiple signaling molecules. For instance, ASAP1 has a PH domain, ankyrin (ANK) repeats, proline-rich and Src-homology (SH) 3 domains and has been shown to bind PI(4,5)P2, Src, and Crk. PAPa/PAG3, with a similar domain structure, binds phosphoinositides, Src, Pyk, and paxillin. The GITs bind bARK, paxillin and the Rac/Cdc42 exchange factor PIX (also known as Cool). ASAP-related proteins, ARAP1, 2 and 3 have Arf GAP, Rho GAP,Ankyrin repeat, Ras-associating (RA), and five PH domains, and therefore have the potential of integrating four signaling pathways."
BIOCARTA_ARENRF2_PATHWAY,Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage biological macromolecules and are detrimental to cellular health. Electrophilic compounds, xenobiotics and antioxidants are sources of reactive oxygen species, creating oxidative stress that can harm cells. Enzymes are involved in the Phase II detoxification of xenobiotics to reduce cellular stress include glutathione transferases, quinone reductase, epoxide hydrolase, heme oxygenase, UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Expression of these genes protects cells from oxidative damage and can prevent mutagenesis and cancer. Transcription of these enzymes is coordinately regulated through antioxidant response elements (AREs). Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) and Nrf1 are transcription factors that bind to AREs and activate these genes. Inactive Nrf2 is retained in the cytosol by association a complex with the cytoskeletal protein Keap1. Cytosolic Nrf2 is phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to protein kinase C activation and Map kinase pathways. In the nucleus, Nrf2 activate genes through AREs by interacting with transcription factors in the bZIP family, including CREB, ATF4 and fos or jun. Nrf2 activation of genes is opposed by small maf proteins, including MafG and MafK, maintaining a counterbalance to Nrf2 and balancing the oxidation level of the intracellular environment."
BIOCARTA_ARF_PATHWAY,Tumor Suppressor Arf Inhibits Ribosomal Biogenesis,"Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A) goes by the colloquial designation p16, which is sometimes referred to as p16(INK4). The alpha transcript of CDKN2A has been shown to encode p16(INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the RB protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A encodes p14(ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14(ARF) is shorter than the corresponding mouse protein, p19(ARF), and the 2 proteins share only 50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53 response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A and MDM2, and resulting in a distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2/M phases. Two unrelated proteins encoded by the INK4A-ARF locus function in tumor suppression. ARF binds to MDM2 and promotes the rapid degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the E1-beta-encoded N-terminal domain of ARF and a C-terminal region of MDM2. ARF-promoted MDM2 degradation is associated with MDM2 modification and concurrent p53 stabilization and accumulation. The p19(Arf) tumor suppressor inhibits production of ribosomal RNA, retarding processing of 47/45S and 32S precursors. These effects correlate with but do not strictly depend upon inhibition of rRNA biosynthesis or cell cycle arrest, are not mimicked by p53, and require neither p53 nor Mdm2. Arf mutants lacking conserved amino acid residues 2-14 do not block rRNA synthesis and processing or inhibit cell proliferation. Evolution may have linked a primordial nucleolar Arf function to Mdm2 and p53, creating a more efficient checkpoint-signaling pathway for coordinating ribosomal biogenesis and cell cycle progression."
BIOCARTA_ASBCELL_PATHWAY,Antigen Dependent B Cell Activation,"A key part of the immune system is the production of immunoglobulins (antibodies) by B cells to bind and inactivate specific foreign antigens. The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4+ T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD40 interaction with CD40L and CD28 interaction with CD80 provide positive costimulatory signals that stimulate B cell activation and proliferation. T cell receptor activation induces expression of molecules like the CD40 ligand that modulate the B cell-T cell interaction. The CD40-CD40L interaction induces cytokine production and expression of other genes and alters the fate of the B cell involved in the interaction. If the interaction between CD40 and CD40L is prolonged, the B cell can be induced to become a memory cell rather than a plasma cell. Fas ligand binding to Fas between B and T cells may negatively modulate B cell activation, inducing apoptosis that limits B cell proliferation and activation. Cytokines like IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 also play an important role in B cell activation."
BIOCARTA_AT1R_PATHWAY,Angiotensin II mediated activation of JNK Pathway via Pyk2 dependent signaling,"Ang II binding to AT1-R triggers the activation of Ca2+ signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to the Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1 but not Cdc42, although the direct activation of Rac1 by Pyk2 is not proved in this study. In turn, Rac1 activates a small G protein-activated kinase whose identity is still controversial, but one of which has been suggested to be PAK1. Finally, the JNK cascade, including MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK, is activated, causing induction of c-Jun gene via binding of ATF2 and c-Jun heterodimer to the junTRE2 site. Ang II is closely involved in the cardiac remodeling by stimulating synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It was recently found that expression of fibronectin by Ang II is transcriptionally regulated by AP-1 complex in cardiac fibroblasts. Collagenase gene containg AP-1 sites is also regulated by AP-1 components including c-Jun. AP-1 activity is also enhanced in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Expression of ANF is regulated by AP-1 components."
BIOCARTA_ATM_PATHWAY,ATM Signaling Pathway,"The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) encodes a protein kinase that acts as a tumor suppressor. ATM activation by ionizing radiation damage to DNA stimulates DNA repair and blocks progression through the cell cycle. Mutation of the ATM gene causes the disease ataxia telangiectasia which which involves an inherited predisposition to some cancers. To play this role ATM interacts with a broad network of proteins, including checkpoint factors (chk1, chk2), tumor suppressors (p53 and BRCA), DNA repair factors (RAD50, RAD51, GADD45), and other signaling molecules (c-Abl and NF-kB). In addition to regulating DNA repair and the cell cycle, ATM can also trigger apoptosis in radiation treated cells."
BIOCARTA_ATRBRCA_PATHWAY,"Role of BRCA1,  BRCA2 and ATR in Cancer Susceptibility","BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified genetically as breast cancer susceptibility genes when a single copy of the gene is mutated and are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, including blocking cell cycle progression and inducing DNA repair to preserve the integrity of the genome during cell division. BRCA1 and BRCA2 induce double-stranded repair of breaks using homologous recombination, in part through activation of RAD51. BRCA1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase targeting the protein FancD2 that activates checkpoint control, integrating the ATM response to ionizing radiation and the FA response to cross-linking agents like mitomycin C. Mutation of one of the several components of the FA complex involved in maintaining integrity of the genome leads to the condition Fanconi anemia. One member of the FA complex was recently identified as BRCA2, which leads to Fanconi anemia when both copies of the gene are mutated. Another related factor involved in the response of cells to DNA damage is the kinase ATM. ATM is mutated in patients with AT, a condition with many similar traits to Fanconi anemia. Like ATM, ATR serves as a checkpoint kinase that halts cell cycle progression and induces DNA repair when DNA is damaged. Loss of ATR results in a loss of checkpoint control in response to DNA damage, leading to cell death, and deletion of the ATR gene in mice is embryonic lethal. ATRIP is a protein that interacts with ATR and is a substrate for its kinase activity. ATRIP is required for ATR function, and removal of ATRIP also leads to a loss of checkpoint control of the cell cycle. ATR and ATM kinase targets include repair enzymes like Rad51, and the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2, as well as BRCA1 and BRCA2. The close relationship of the genes involved in breast cancer and Fanconi anemia has helped illuminate this signaling system, and may help lead to improved understanding and treatment of these conditions."
BIOCARTA_BAD_PATHWAY,Regulation of BAD phosphorylation,"The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of three sites (ser 112,136 and 155). Phosphorylation at these sites results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. While ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with the activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. BAD Ser 155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors."

BIOCARTA_BARR_MAPK_PATHWAY,Role of b-arrestins in the activation and targeting of MAP kinases,"The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs triggers the assembly of a MAP kinase activation complex using -arrestin as a scaffold, with subsequent activation of a -arrestin-bound pool of ERK1/2. The receptor-arrestinERK complexes are localized to endosomal vesicles, and their formation does not result in nuclear translocation of activated ERK1/2 or stimulation of cell proliferation. The function of -arrestin-bound ERK1/2 is presently unknown. Activation of ERK1/2 by -arrestin scaffolds may favor the phosphorylation of plasma membrane, cytosolic, or cytoskeletal ERK1/2 substrates, or it may lead to transcriptional activation through the ERK-dependent activation of other kinases. The model depicts -arrestin scaffolding of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade, based upon data obtained with the protease-activated PAR2 and angiotensin AT1a receptors. A similar mechanism has been proposed for regulation of the JNK3 MAP kinase cascade by AT1a receptors."
BIOCARTA_BARRESTIN_PATHWAY,b-arrestins in GPCR Desensitization,"Role of -arrestins in the desensitization, sequestration and intracellular trafficking of GPCRs. Homologous desensitization of GPCRs (1) results from the binding of -arrestins (-arr) to agonist -occupied receptors following phosphorylation of the receptor by GRKs. -arrestin binding sterically precludes coupling between the receptor and heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to termination of signaling by G proteins effectors. Receptor-bound -arrestins also act as adapter proteins, binding to components of the clathrin endocytic machinery including clathrin, 2-adaptin (AP-2). Receptor sequestration (2) reflects the dynamin (Dyn)-dependent endocytosis of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits. Once internalized, GPCRs exhibit two distinct patterns of -arrestin interaction. `Class A' GPCRs, for example the 2 adrenergic receptor, rapidly dissociate from -arrestin upon internalization. These receptors are trafficked to an acidified endosomal compartment, wherein the ligand is dissociated and the receptor dephosphorylated by a GPCR-specific protein phosphatase PP2A isoform, and are subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane (3). `Class B' receptors, for example the angiotensin II AT1a receptor, form stable receptor--arrestin complexes. These receptors accumulate in endocytic vesicles and are either targeted for degradation or slowly recycled to the membrane via as yet poorly defined routes."
BIOCARTA_BARRESTIN_SRC_PATHWAY,Roles of b-arrestin-dependent Recruitment of Src Kinases in GPCR Signaling,"The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs coincides with the recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases, including c-Src, Hck and c-Fgr (Src-TK), to the receptor-arrestin complex. Several signaling events have been reported to involve -arrestin-dependent Src recruitment. These include the regulation of clathrin-dependent 2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis by tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, Ras-dependent activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade and stimulation of cell proliferation by 2-adrenergic and neurokinin NK1 receptors, and stimulation of chemokine CXCR1 receptor-mediated neutrophil degranulation"
BIOCARTA_BBCELL_PATHWAY,Bystander B Cell Activation, 
BIOCARTA_BCELLSURVIVAL_PATHWAY,B Cell Survival Pathway,"Physical interactions between intergrin alpha4beta1 heterodimer expressed on B cells and counter receptors on stroma cells are key mediators of the survival of normal and malignant B cells. Recent data indicate that integrin stimulation increases FBI-1, XIAP, surviving, and CCT4 expression but inhibits Requiem, c-Fos, and caspase 3 and 7 induction."
BIOCARTA_BCR_PATHWAY,BCR Signaling Pathway,"Significant progress has been made towards delineation of the intrinsic molecular processes that regulate B lymphocyte immune function. Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of downstream effector proteins. Studies have demonstrated that Src family PTKs are activated initially and serve to phosphorylate CD79a and CD79b thereby creating phosphotyrosine motifs that recruit downstream signaling proteins. In particular, phosphorylation of the BCR complex leads to the recruitment and activation of the PTK Syk, which in turn promotes phosphorylation of PLCg, Shc and Vav. Additionally, the Tec family member Btk is recruited to the plasma membrane where it is involved in activation of PLCg. Initiation of B lymphocyte activation is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent formation of multi-molecular effector protein complexes that activate downstream signaling pathways. The formation of such complexes was initially hypothesized to occur primarily via effector protein binding to the BCR complex itself. However, recent studies have demonstrated that productive signaling via the BCR is in fact dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more adapter proteins that play a crucial role in recruitment and organization of effector proteins at the plasma membrane. The SLP-65/BLNK adapter protein has recently been shown to play a crucial role in recruitment and activation of key signal transducing effector proteins in the B cell. After the BCR has been engaged by antigen and the activation response has been initiated, numerous second messengers and intermediate signal transducing proteins are activated. These include the production of lipid second messengers by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to yield diacylglycerol and 1,4,5-inositoltrisphosphate (IP3). DAG is important for activation of PKC whereas IP3 promote release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent influx Ca2+ from the extracellular space. Numerous intermediate signaling proteins are also activated including the Ras and Rap1, which are small molecular weight GTPases and these ultimately lead to the activation of MAP kinases including Erk, JNK and p38. The net effect of second messenger production and activation of intermediate signaling proteins is the concerted regulation of several transcription factors that mediate gene transcription in the B cell."
BIOCARTA_BIOPEPTIDES_PATHWAY,Bioactive Peptide Induced Signaling Pathway,"Many different peptides act as signaling molecules, including the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin, the protease enzyme thrombin, and the blood pressure regulating peptide angiotensin. While these three proteins are distinct in their sequence and physiology, and act through different cell surface receptors, they share in a common class of cell surface receptors called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other polypeptide ligands of GPCRs include vasopressin, oxytocin, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, GnRH, leutinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, orexins, urotensin II, endorphins, enkephalins, and many others. GPCRs are a broad and diverse gene family that respond not only to peptide ligands but also small molecule neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline), light, odorants, taste, lipids, nucleotides, and ions. The main signaling mechanism used by GPCRs is to interact with G-protein GTPase proteins coupled to downstream second messenger systems including intracellular calcium release and cAMP production. The intracellular signaling systems used by peptide GPCRs are similar to those used by all GPCRs, and are typically classified according to the G-protein they interact with and the second messenger system that is activated. For Gs-coupled GPCRs, activation of the G-protein Gs by receptor stimulates the downstream activation of adenylate cyclase and the production of cyclic AMP, while Gi-coupled receptors inhibit cAMP production. One of the key results of cAMP production is activation of protein kinase A. Gq-coupled receptors stimulate phospholipase C, releasing IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 binds to a receptor in the ER to cause the release of intracellular calcium, and the subsequent activation of protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent pathways. In addition to these second messenger signaling systems for GPCRs, GPCR pathways exhibit crosstalk with other signaling pathways including tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and map kinase pathways. Transactivation of either receptor tyrosine kinases like the EGF receptor or focal adhesion complexes can stimulate ras activation through the adaptor proteins Shc, Grb2 and Sos, and downstream Map kinases activating Erk1 and Erk2. Src kinases may also play an essential intermediary role in the activation of ras and map kinase pathways by GPCRs."
BIOCARTA_BLYMPHOCYTE_PATHWAY,B Lymphocyte Cell Surface Molecules,"B cells must communicate with their environment to participate in the immune system as the source of antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates activation of B cells and T cells through dephosphorylation of signaling factors. CD32 is a receptor for IgG Fc, and is also called FcgammaRII. The number of proteins on the surface of B cell proteins indicates the complexity of regulation of B cell activation."

BIOCARTA_BTG2_PATHWAY,BTG family proteins and cell cycle regulation, 
BIOCARTA_CACAM_PATHWAY,Ca++/ Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase Activation,"The calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are involved in a large number of cellular responses induced by hormones, neurotransmitters and other signalling. Elevation of calcium functions as a major second messenger, where the intracellular concentration of calcium can be maintained at extremely low levels and susequently increased following specific calcium-mobilizing stimuli. There are many buffers to the calcium fluxuations including membrane pumps and calcium-binding proteins that create discrete spatial control of its effectors and their targets. The current family of multifunctional calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) consists of CaMKI, CaMKII and CaMKIV. These kinases translate and co-ordinate the calcium fluxuations into the appropriate cellular responses via phosphorylation. These kinases are partially regulated by the intracellular calcium receptor calmodulin (CaM), have common as well as unique features in their structure, regulation and activation. CaMKII, CaMKI and CaMKIV, have an autoregulatory domain that restricts or inhibits enzymic activity in the absence of calcium/CaM. Calcium/CaM binding alone produces maximal activity of CaMKII, whereas CaMKI and CaMKIV have an activation loop that requires phosphorylation of a threonine residue by CaMK kinase (CaMKK) for maximal activity. Two genes (alpha and beta) for CaMKK, which is also regulated by CaM, have been identified. The highest expression of these isoforms occurs in the brain but the activity of the CaMKs has been identified in most cell types. CaMKIV has a post-calmodulin autophosphorylation step that is not observed in CaMKI. The CaMKII multimer can autophosphorylate either the autoregulatory domain or the CaM-binding domain, producing diverse effects in its regulation and sensitivity to Calcium/CaM. Autophosphorylation of CaMKII can produce Calcium/CaM- independent activity (autonomous activity), without affecting its maximal Calcium/CaM-stimulated activity. The CaMKII autophosphorylation involves a kinase cascade of sorts, with each subunit of the multimeric enzyme acting as both kinase and kinase kinase. Autophosphorylation establishes a 1000-fold increase in the affinity for its activator Calcium/CaM (also known as CaM trapping); however, autophosphorylation within the CaM-binding domain following CaM dissociation of activated/autophosphorylated enzyme restricts or prevents CaM from rebinding (CaM capping). The mechanisms and consequences of autophosphorylation are central to the CaMKII enzyme's complex regulatory behavior enabling it to become differentially activated at different frequencies and levels of calcium spikes. The target proteins for the CaMKs are very similar. An example target of the CaMKs is the transcriptional activating protein CREB. The phosphorylation states of CREB after CaMK phosphorlyation differ by the additional phosphorylation of CREB at serine 142 that functions as an additional inhibitory site. This difference appears to be the result of adjacent amino acids."
BIOCARTA_CALCINEURIN_PATHWAY,Effects of calcineurin in Keratinocyte Differentiation,"The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced during calcium-induced differentiation, but does increase when tested in vitro. PKC activity is increased by calcium during keratinocyte differentiation but PKC MARCKS phosphorylation is blocked by the formation of a complex between calmodulin and MARCKS. The immunosuppressants cyclosporin-A (CsA) and FK506 inhibit T cell activation through indirect inhibition of NFAT activation and have several side effects including changes in the skin, suggesting that calcineurin activity may play a role in normal skin physiology. CsA is used to treat psoriasis, a disease involving abnormal proliferation of skin cells. The activity of CsA in treating psoriasis may involve inhibition of immune cells, but may also directly involve inhibition of calcineurin activity in keratinocytes."
BIOCARTA_CARDIACEGF_PATHWAY,Role of EGF Receptor Transactivation by GPCRs in Cardiac Hypertrophy,"One of responses to increased blood pressure is cardiac hypertrophy through increased size of ventricular myocardial cells leading to increased thickness of the ventricular walls. Cardiac hypertrophy allows the heart to handle the increased stress caused by elevated blood pressure but is also a risk factor associated with heart disease. Cardiac hypertrophy results from cross-talk between G-protein coupled receptor signaling and the EGF receptor pathway. Several GPCR ligands are known to stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, including factors that regulate blood pressure such as angiotensin II and endothelin- 1. These factors stimulate phospholipase C through Gq activation, and the production of 1P3 and diacylglycerol second messengers. PKC-delta is activated by DAG and interacts with the metalloproteinase ADAM12. ADAM12 cleaves the membrane-bound HB-EGF to release soluble EGF ligand that activates EGF receptor in myocardial cells. EGF receptor activation downstream through small G proteins and the MAP kinase pathway ultimately leads to cardiac hypertrophy. Signals by GPCR ligands such as angiotensin II result in transcriptional translation of immediate early genes like fos and other genes involved in long-term remodeling of heart tissue and the physiological response to stress in the heart such as the atrial natriuretic factor. Factors such as the AKT kinase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NE-kB also are involved in signaling that leads to hypertrophy, although their role is not yet clear. Blocking this pathway at various steps may prevent heart disease through the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy, but may also have other consequences."
BIOCARTA_CARM1_PATHWAY,Transcription Regulation by Methyltransferase of CARM1,"Several forms of post-translational modification regulate protein activities. Recently, protein methylation by CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) has been observed to play a key role in transcriptional regulation. CARM1 associates with the p160 class of transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by steroid hormone family receptors. CARM1 also interacts with CBP/p300 transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by a large variety of transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors and CEBP. One target of CARM1 is the core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets of the histone acetylase activity of CBP/p300 coactivators. Recruitment of CARM1 to the promoter region by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and makes promoter regions more accessible for transcription. Another target of CARM1 methylation is a coactivator it interacts with, CBP. Methylation of CBP by CARM1 blocks CBP from acting as a coactivator for CREB and redirects the limited CBP pool in the cell to be available for steroid hormone receptors. Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known."
BIOCARTA_CARM_ER_PATHWAY,CARM1 and Regulation of the Estrogen Receptor,"Several forms of post-translational modification regulate protein activities.

Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known. The methylation activity of CARM1 modulates the activity of specific transcriptional regulators. CARM1 acts as a coactivator for the myogenic transcription factor Mef2c, and is necessary for normal muscle cell differentiation. The estrogen receptor is another transcription factor that uses CARM1 as one of several coactivators, acting synergistically with CBP through the Grip1 member of the p160 family of coactivators. The interaction of estrogen receptor with various ligand-dependent coactivators may produce the tissue selective response of some estrogen receptor ligands like tamoxifen."
BIOCARTA_CASPASE_PATHWAY,Caspase Cascade in Apoptosis,"Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cell surface receptors like FAS, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death domain like FAS. The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets. Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis have been suggested."
BIOCARTA_CB1R_PATHWAY,"Metabolism of Anandamide, an Endogenous Cannabinoid", 
BIOCARTA_CBL_PATHWAY,CBL mediated ligand-induced downregulation of EGF receptors,"As with many cell-surface receptors, activation of the EGF receptor can result in receptor internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis, desensitizing further receptor signaling. This process requires clathrin and occurs in clathrin-coated pits, which pinch off from the plasma membrane to form vesicles that move to the early endosome. From the early endosome, receptors can either be recycled back to the cell surface, or they can move through the late endosome to the lysosome for proteolytic degradation. The sorting of receptors in the early endosome for degradation requires the tyrosine kinase activity of activated growth factor receptor, and involves ubiquitination of the receptor. Targeting of receptors for degradation requires members of the Cbl gene family. Cbl proteins bind to tyrosine phosphorylated EGF receptor, and are E3 ubiquitination ligases that label receptor for degradation. Cbl also recruits Cin85 to the receptor complex, and blocking Cin85 interaction blocks receptor internalization and degradation. Endophilins are also a member of this receptor-bound protein complex. In its role as a ubiquitin ligase and docking protein, Cbl desensitizes EGF signaling and also opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase Src, which phosphorylates Cbl, and helps to activate the ubiquitination and degradation of EGF receptor. PKC activation and threonine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor can induce heterologous receptor internalization, but opposes Cbl-mediated receptor degradation. PKC phosphorylated receptors are sorted for recycling to the cell surface, and directed away from the late endosome and proteosome. Other growth factor receptors are regulated in a similar manner, including the PDGF receptor, HGF receptor and the CSF-1 receptor, indicating that this is a fairly general regulatory mechanism. The importance of Cbl in the down-regulation of growth factor signaling means that it will have an important role in cellular transformation and the development and treatment of cancer."
BIOCARTA_CCR3_PATHWAY,CCR3 signaling in Eosinophils,"Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage."
BIOCARTA_CCR5_PATHWAY,Pertussis toxin-insensitive CCR5 Signaling in Macrophage,"The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in macrophages are activated by their peptide ligands and also by the HIV envelope protein GP120 during HIV infection. One mechanism of signaling by these GPCRs is through activation of Gi signaling. These chemokine receptors can also signal through a Gi-independent pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. This pathway elevates calcium influx into the cell through CRAC channels, ion channels that are activated by calcium release. Elevated calcium from CRAC is required for downstream activation of Pyk2, a focal adhesion-associated protein kinase. Non Gi signaling by these chemokine receptors also involves the Jnk and p38 Map kinase pathways leading to AP-1 activation and activation of genes such as MIP-1 and MCP-1. This pathway may be involved in the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of AIDS."
BIOCARTA_CD40_PATHWAY,CD40L Signaling Pathway,"The CD40 receptor was first associated with expression in B cells and the role it plays through its ligand CD40L (CD154) in moderating T cell activation. Broader expression may indicate a broader role for CD40 and CD40L in immune function and disease states such as transplant rejection and HIV infection. Disruption of CD40 interaction with CD40L may prove therapeutic in the treatment of autoimmune disorders or heart disease and modulation of the interaction may in the future be exploited in cancer treatment. As a member of the TNF receptor family, CD40 relies on interaction with TRAF proteins to mediate an intracellular signal in response to CD40L binding. The pathway downstream of TRAFs activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through a kinase pathway involving map kinases, NIK (NF-kappaB inducing kinase) and I-kappa B kinases. Some CD40 responses like regulation of immunoglobulin expression might be mediated by NF-kappaB transcriptional activation."
BIOCARTA_CDC25_PATHWAY,cdc25 and chk1 Regulatory Pathway in response to DNA damage, 
BIOCARTA_CDC42RAC_PATHWAY,Role of PI3K subunit p85 in regulation of Actin Organization and Cell Migration,"Migration of cells is involved in essential functions such as development, invasiveness of cancer cells, leukocyte movement toward chemotactic signals, and fibroblast response to injury. Cells can migrate in a specific direction in response to extracellular signals through pathways that trigger changes in the cytoskeleton, particularly actin filaments, increasing lamellipodia and filopodia formation and decreasing focal adhesions. Factors like PDGF activate PI3 kinase and multiple pathways downstream to stimulate cell migration. One pathway regulating migration through the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase does not require PI3-kinase activity. In this pathway, p85 of PI3-kinase activates cdc42, which activates N-Wasp (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) to regulate ARP-2/3. ARP-2/3 is a complex of proteins localized at the leading edge of moving cells that nucleates the formation of new actin fibers and interacts with Wasp to stimulate migration. The cdc42 pathway also regulates p21-activate kinase 1 (PAK1). Another pathway by which PI3 kinase regulates migration is through the small GTPase Rac. PAK1 is a downstream target of Rac as well as cdc42. Downstream of Rac and PAK1, Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates myosin light chain to increase cell migration. The regulation of the localization and activity of signaling factors creates coordinated pathways linking extracellular signals and cellular migration."
BIOCARTA_CDK5_PATHWAY,Phosphorylation of MEK1 by cdk5/p35 down regulates the MAP kinase pathway,"Map kinases transduce responses to extracellular signals by a variety of routes, and communicate with other pathways through extensive crosstalk networks. A closely studied Map kinase cascade originates with tyrosine kinase activation, and activation of Ras. Ras activates Raf, Raf activates the Map kinase kinases Mek1 and Mek2 and these kinases activate downstream Map kinases like Erk1 and Erk2. Erk1 and Erk2 in turn activate transgenes like p35 through the Map kinase activated transcription factor EGR-1. Mek1 plays a central role in many different Map kinase pathways. Factors that activate Mek1 include growth factors like NGF, cytokines, chemokines, and phorbol ester, resulting in cellular proliferation and survival. Mek1 activation may also play a role in differentiation in neuronal tissues. In cultured neuronal PC-12 cells, NGF induces neurite outgrowth via Mek1 and the map kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of Mek1 can transform cells and may play a role in cancer. The crucial role of Mek1 in a variety of pathways including cellular transformation suggests that the cell must tightly regulate its activity. Cdk5 is a kinase that regulates the activity of Mek1. Although Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase gene family, the activity of Cdk5 does not appear to be regulated by cyclins, but is activated by association with p35. Cdk5 does not act as a checkpoint kinase to regulate cell cycle progression, but acts as a regulatory kinase involved in other post-mitotic processes such as neuronal activity such as neuronal migration during development and neurite outgrowth. Mice lacking Cdk5 exhibit defects in neuronal development. One target of Cdk5 is Mek1. Phosphorylation of Mek1 by Cdk5 represses Mek1 activity and blocks downstream cellular responses. The activation of p35 by Map kinase pathways followed by deactivation of Map kinase signaling by the Cdk5/p35 complex completes the loop of a feedback circuit to terminate Map kinase signaling."
BIOCARTA_CDMAC_PATHWAY,Cadmium induces DNA synthesis and proliferation in macrophages,"Exposure to divalent cadmium ions (Cd2+) is a known cancer risk factor, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inappropriate induction of cellular proliferation by cadmium are still being figured out. One cellular model used to study this process is macrophages grown in culture. In cultured macrophages, cadmium acts both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm to induce proliferation. At the cell surface, cadmium interacts with a pertussis-sensitive cell surface receptor, probably a Gi-coupled GPCR, to stimulate proliferation. Cadmium can enter cells through calcium ion channels and once in cells affects calcium release by the ER. In addition to changes in intracellular calcium, the proliferative effects of cadmium are mediated by the Ras/Map kinase pathway, and also NF-kB. Inhibition of phospholipase C, map kinases, or NF-kB with a variety of pharmacological inhibitors all blocked the activation of cellular proliferation by cadmium. Protein kinase C is also activated by cadmium, upstream of the Map kinase pathway. Changes in transcription induced by cadmium include induction of immediate early genes like fos, jun, and myc. In addition to inducing cellular proliferation, cadmium also is slightly genotoxic due to inhibition of DNA repair, activates stress genes, and inhibits the immune system. The immuno-modulatory effects observed with cadmium treatment may also involvement transcriptional disregulation, including the expression of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-alpha. Although macrophages have been used for many studies, other cell types are also the target of cadmiums toxicity."
BIOCARTA_CELL2CELL_PATHWAY,Cell to Cell Adhesion Signaling,"Interactions between cells responsible for cell to cell adhesion also can communicate signals into the cellular interior, often involving interactions with cytoskeletal elements to produce changes in cell motility, migration, proliferation and shape. The cadherins are cell surface adhesion molecules that help form tight junctions between cells such as formation of epithelial cell layers. E-cadherin inactivation has been implicated in cancer development. In addition to mediating adhesion with other cells, cadherins transduce signals into cells through interactions with the catenins. Catenins probably affect actin cytoskeletal function through interactions with proteins like actinin and vinculin. Catenins also probably trigger changes in cell shape and motility with signals through the Rho small GTPases. Another important cell adhesion molecule is CD-31, or PECAM-1, involved in the formation of junctions between endothelial cells, cell migration, migration of lymphocytes, and regulation of lymphocyte activation. Src phosphorylates PECAM-1 on tyrosine residues causing SHP-2 association with PECAM-1. Paxillin acts as an adaptor protein between proteins involved in adhesion signaling like FAK and src and cytoskeletal elements. In addition to signals created by adhesion molecules to alter cellular responses, other signaling pathways can alter adhesion through components of the focal adhesion complex."
BIOCARTA_CELLCYCLE_PATHWAY,Cyclins and Cell Cycle Regulation,"The cell cycle is regulated by the interplay of many molecules. Key among these are the cyclins which are expressed and then degraded in a concerted fashion to drive the stages of the cell cycle. Cyclins combine with cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) to form activated kinases that phosphorylate targets leading to cell cycle regulation. A breakdown in the regulation of this cycle can lead to out of control growth and contribute to tumor formation. Defects in many of the molecules that regulate the cell cycle have been implicated in cancer. Key among these are p53, the cdk inhibitors (p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27), and Rb, all of which act to keep the cell cycle from progressing until all repairs to damaged DNA have been completed."
BIOCARTA_CERAMIDE_PATHWAY,Ceramide Signaling Pathway,"Over 1,000 papers and reviews have been written about the role of ceramide in the production of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Ceramide is a sphingosine-based lipid-signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This diagram represents some of the current understanding of the cascades that couple ceramide to specific signaling pathways. These cascades illustrate that ceramide can be a growth stimulus or proapototic signal. The ultimate ceramide action is determined within the context of other stimuli and by the subcellular topology of its production and is cell-type specific. There are 2 forms of sphingomyelinase, acid (acid-sphingomyelinase:A-SMase) and neutral (neutral-sphingomyelinase N-SMase), that can produce ceramide. TNF-alpha can stimulate either form of sphingomyelinase as can other death receptors. Different domanis of TNF-alpha stimulate the different Smases. N-SMase stimulation is enhanced by the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1). The activity of each form is dependent on the local intracellular pH. In the illustration the forms are seperated to reduce confusion however ceramide produced by either method can stimulate either cascade depending on the presence of specific co-factors and activators. A-SMase has been recognized as one of the required molecules to mediate proapoptotic signalling in cell death induced by a diverse array of stresses such as H2O2, Heat, UV exposure and Radiation. ROS generation in mitochondria activates caspase-3 via cooperation of cytochrome c, Aif and caspase-9 and stimulates or increases ceramide generation through A-SMase in a proaptotic activation cycle. Caspase-3 further increases its own activation by proteolytically cleaving ceramide inhibited catalase which is an inhibitor of ROS generation. Ceramide-activated protein kinase(CARK) also known as Kinase Supressor of RAS (KSR) activity is in some cases the switch point in the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals and is also cell-type specific. In endothelial cells for example the activation of KSR is required for apoptosis. In contrast in epithelial cells activation of KSR is required for cell proliferation. An additional switch point is the availability of Bad in the cell. Activation of KSR leads to further mitocondrial stimulation or association with RAS and activation of the Raf1 cascade leading to proliferation or differentiation."
BIOCARTA_CFTR_PATHWAY,Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and beta 2 adrenergic receptor (b2AR) pathway,"The defects in cAMP-regulated chloride channel CTFR are believed to be the major cause for cystic fibrosis. Regulation of CFTR protein by the surface receptor beta adrenergic receptor is mediated through the ezrin/radixin/moesin binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), which binds both the C-termini CFTR and b2AR through their PDZ binding motifs. In the resting state, CFTR, b2AR, and EBP50 exist as a macromolecular complex on the apical surface of epithelial cells. Upon agonist activation of the b2AR, the adenulate cyclase is stimulated through the G protein pathway, leading to an increase in cAMP. The elevated concentration of cAMP activates PKA, which is anchored near CFTR via interaction with Ezrin. The phosphorylation of CFTR by PKA disrupts the complex and leads to compartmentalized and specific signaling of the channel."
BIOCARTA_CHEMICAL_PATHWAY,Apoptotic Signaling in Response to DNA Damage,"The cellular activation of the caspase cascade resulting in cell death is triggered by chemical damage to DNA which stimulates a sequence resulting in the cleavage of Bid in a manner similar to the binding of so called death-receptors or directly initiates the permeability transition of the mitochondrial membrane. The permiability transition releases several factors including cytochrome c, AIF and other factors in to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase cascade. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death."
BIOCARTA_CHREBP_PATHWAY,ChREBP regulation by carbohydrates and cAMP,"Liver is the major site for carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis and glycogen synthesis) and triglyceride synthesis (lipogenesis). While insulin was long thought to be the major regulator of hepatic gene expression, emerging evidence show that nutrients, in particular, glucose and fatty acids, are also able to regulate hepatic genes. This diagram illustrates how glucose metabolite, rather than glucose itself, contributes to the coordinated regulation of carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis in liver through phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ChREBP (carbohydrate responsive element binding protein). ChREBP is a basic helix-loop helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) transcription factor, shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a glucose-responsive manner in hepatocytes. When serum glucose is elevated, glucose transporter (GLUT2) and glucokinase (GCK) allow for rapid uptake and equilibration of intracellular glucose levels. This flux of glucose promotes, via the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway (HMP Shunt), the formation of xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu-5-P), which activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to dephosphorylate ChREBP (Ser196) and promote its nuclear localization. PP2A further dephosphorylates ChREBP in the nucleus, allowing it to dimerize with the bHLH/LZ transcription factor Max-like protein X (MLX) and activate transcription of a number of glycolytic and lipogenic genes containing a ChoRE, such as liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA), and fatty acid synthase (FASN). Upon starvation or high-fat feeding, intrahepatic levels of cAMP and AMP are elevated to activate protein kinase A (PKA) and AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), respectively. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Thr666 and Ser626 inhibits the DNA binding capacity of ChREBP; so does AMPK-mediated modification of Ser568. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser196 promotes interaction with 14-3-3 and thus sequesters ChREBP in the cytosol. In summary, the phosphorylated form of ChREBP is rendered inactive due to its diminished DNA binding capacity and subcellular compartmentalization. Glucose metabolism triggers dephosphorylation of ChREBP, allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of both glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression in liver. The fact that ChREBP/ mice are intolerant to glucose and insulin resistant suggests that ChREBP may also play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes."
BIOCARTA_CIRCADIAN_PATHWAY,Circadian Rhythms, 
BIOCARTA_CK1_PATHWAY,Regulation of ck1/cdk5 by type 1 glutamate receptors,"Cdk5 is a cyclin dependent protein kinase involved in dopaminergic signaling in the neostriatal region of the brain. The role of cdk5 in dopamine responses occurs through phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Caseine kinase 1 (CK1) also regulates DARPP-32 phosphorylation and dopamine signaling. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by cdk5 reduced dopamine signaling. Depending on its phosphorylation state, DARPP-32 inhibits either protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or PKA. The role of mGLUR1 in this process is supported by the induction of cdk5 and CK1 activity by the mGLUR1 agonist DHPG and the subsequent phosphorylation of DARPP-32 associated with DHPG treatment of nigrostriatal neurons. CK-1 and Ckd5 inhibitors block the DHPG induced DARPP-32 phosphorylation. Dopamine exerts a positive signal that increases dopamine response by reversing phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at threonine-75. Dopamine initiates this pathway through activation of the D1 dopamine receptor, a Gs coupled GPCR, elevating cAMP and activating PKA. PKA activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which dephosphorylates DARPP-32 and increases dopamine responsiveness. This also removes the inhibition of PKA by DARPP-32, forming a positive feedback loop for further DARPP-32 inactivation by PKA. Activation of the D2 dopamine receptor has the opposite effect, shifting the DARPP-32 population toward the threonine-75 phosphorylated form."
BIOCARTA_CLASSIC_PATHWAY,Classical Complement Pathway,"The complement system is part of the defense against invading cells and is composed of about twenty different proteins found in the plasma. When activated, complement proteins form a pathway of proteolytic reactions that culminates in the lysis of foreign cells. The complement system also stimulates phagocytosis of foreign cells and an inflammatory response. There are two different complement systems, the classical complement pathway initiated by antibody complexes on the cell surface, and an alternative complement pathway that is initiated without antibodies. The complement system proteins are named with a capital C followed by a number. A small letter after the number indicates that the protein is a smaller protein resulting from the cleavage of a larger precursor by a protease. In the classical pathway, the first step is the initiation of the pathway triggered by recognition by complement factor C1 of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface. When C1 complex interacts with aggregates of IgG with antigen on a cell's surface, two C1-associated proteases, C1r and C1s, are activated. Other factors like lipopolysaccharide also activate C1s. Once C1s is activated, it cleaves C4 to form C4b that then binds to the cell membrane of the cell being attacked. The proteolytic complement cascade is then amplified on the cell membrane through sequential cleavage of complement factors and recruitment of new factors until a cell surface complex containing C5b, C6, C7, and C8 is formed. The addition of a multiple C9 proteins creates the membrane attack complex results in a large pore that spans the membrane of the cell being attacked, allowing ions to flow freely between the cellular interior and exterior. Ions flow out, but large molecules stay in, causing water to flood into the cell and ultimately burst the cell from osmotic pressure."
BIOCARTA_COMP_PATHWAY,Complement Pathway,"The complement pathway consists of a series of over thirty proteins in plasma that are part of the immune response. Activation of the complement system lyses bacterial cells, forms chemotactic peptides (C3a and C5a) attracting immune cells, and increases phagocytotic clearance of infecting cells. Complement can also increase the permeability of vascular walls and cause inflammation. Most complement proteins exist in plasma as inactive precursors that cleave and activate each other in a proteolytic cascade in response to three different mechanisms by which the complement system is activated, the classical pathway, the alternative pathway and the lectin-induced pathway. These three systems are distinct in the initiation of the proteolytic cascade but share most of their components and all three converge in the creation of a C3 convertase that cleaves the C3 complement protein, leading ultimately to the formation of the membrane attack complex, MAC, a pore causing lysis of cells. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of foreign cells by antibodies bound to the surface of the cells. The alternative and lectin-induced pathways are both antibody independent. Proteolysis is triggered in the alternative pathway by the spontaneous activation of C3 convertase from C3 and is triggered in the lectin-induced pathway by the recognition of carbohydrates on the bacterial cell surface by mannan-binding protein, Mbp. In addition to providing a key part of the response to bacterial infection, the complement system can be involved in the response to fungi, viruses and protists. While activation of the complement system is a key part of the immune system, it must also be kept in check to prevent inappropriate or exaggerated responses. Twelve different proteins have been identified that inhibit complement activation to control the system, including Factor H, Factor I and C1 inhibitor. Deficiencies in components of the complement system have been identified in humans that cause a variety of immune related disorders. C3 deficiency is associated with recurrent bacterial infections, while a lack of C2 can cause antibody-antigen complexes to accumulate and cause the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus. People lacking C1 inhibitor have also been identified and found to be prone to uncontrolled complement activation and dangerous swelling through production of C3a and C5a anaphylotoxins."
BIOCARTA_CPSF_PATHWAY,Polyadenylation of mRNA, 
BIOCARTA_CREB_PATHWAY,Transcription factor CREB and its extracellular signals,"The transcription factor CREB binds the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and activates transcription in response to a variety of extracellular signals including neurotransmitters, hormones, membrane depolarization, and growth and neurotrophic factors. Protein kinase A and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CaMKII stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, a key regulatory site controlling transcriptional activity. Growth and neurotrophic factors also stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133. Phosphorylation occurs at Ser133 via p44/42 MAP Kinase and p90RSK and also via p38 MAP Kinase and MSK1. CREB exhibit deficiencies in spatial learning tasks, while flies overexpressing or lacking CREB show enhanced or diminished learning, respectively."
BIOCARTA_CREM_PATHWAY,Regulation of Spermatogenesis by CREM, 
BIOCARTA_CSK_PATHWAY,Activation of Csk by cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase Inhibits Signaling through the T Cell Receptor,"Interaction of T cell receptor with specific antigen in the context of MHC II activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to T cell activation. In the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the src family kinases Lck and Fyn are activated to phosphorylate proteins in the T cell receptor complex which recruit and activate the ZAP70 kinase. The activation of ZAP70 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate MAP kinase pathways and cause T cell activation. The CD45 phosphorylase also plays a role in T cell receptor signaling, dephosphorylated Lck and Fyn to activate them. Other factors modulate T cell receptor activation. Csk (COOH-terminal Srk kinase) phosphorylates Lck and deactivates it, opposing the action of CD45. The phosphorylation of Lck by Csk inhibits T cell receptor signaling and inhibits T cell activation. Csk activity is regulated in T cells by PKA, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated by the second messenger cAMP. The activity of Csk also appears to depend on other factors such as CBP, which recruits Csk to the plasma membrane in lipid rafts where other signaling factors such the T cell receptor complex are localized. CBP also directly activates Csk."
BIOCARTA_CTBP1_PATHWAY,SUMOylation as a mechanism to modulate CtBP-dependent gene responses, 
BIOCARTA_CTCF_PATHWAY,CTCF: First Multivalent Nuclear Factor,"CTCF is central to signaling pathways in immature B cells elicited by cross-linking the Ig BCR and stimulation with TGF. Both stimuli result in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. BCR ligation stimulates a transient induction of MYC that leads to high level CTCF expression and feedback suppression of MYC transcription. BCR ligation also activates PTEN opposing PI3K activation of MYC. Pharmacologic inactivation of PI3K or mTOR/FRAP results in suppression of S6K resulting in activation of CTCF and suppression of MYC. CTCF activation induces transcriptional activation of p19ARF, with its downstream consequences, and of p27. Growth arrest is occasioned by co-expression of p21 and p27 and inhibition of MYC. CTCF, is bona fide multivalent DNA-sequence binder which specificity is mediated by different sets of zinc fingers (ZFs). For three different DNA target sites, particular groups of ZFs which cannot be deleted from the 11 ZF domain without loosing binding to a given site, are shown by a rainbow in the box on the left."
BIOCARTA_CTL_PATHWAY,CTL mediated immune response against target cells,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), also known as killer T cells, provide a cell-mediated response to specific foreign antigens associated with cells. CTLs only respond to foreign antigen when it is presented bound to the MHC-1 expressed on the surface of all cells. CTLs do not respond to soluble antigen, but induce apoptosis in viral-infected cells and in cancer cells. When the complex of antigen bound to MHC-1 is bound to antigen-specific T cell receptor, the cytotoxic T cell induces apoptosis in the target cell primarily by two pathways, one involving perforin-mediated apoptosis and the other involving Fas/Fas-ligand interaction. When CTLs are activated by recognition of specific antigen on a cell, they release perforin proteins that integrate into the membrane of the target cell and organize to form a membrane pore. This allows the protease granzyme to enter the cell and activate the apoptotic caspase proteolytic cascade , and also allows other molecules to cross the cell membrane and trigger osmotic lysis of the membrane. The interaction of T-cell Fas ligand with the Fas receptor in the target cell can also activate the caspase cascade and other pathways involved in apoptosis. The interaction of a CTL with antigen-MHC I complex activates the CTL to proliferate and amplify the clone of T cells that respond to that antigen, amplifying the immune response against that specific antigen."
BIOCARTA_CTLA4_PATHWAY,The Co-Stimulatory Signal During T-cell Activation,"For a T cell to be activated by a specific antigen, the T cell receptor must recognize complexes of MHCI with the antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. T cells and the T cell receptor complex do not respond to antigen in solution, but even for the specific antigen they only respond to antigen-MHC-1 complexes on the cell surface. This interaction is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. T cell activation also requires a co-stimulatory signal involving interaction of CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 family genes) on the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 activates a signal transduction pathway acting through PI-3K, Lck and Grb-2/ITK to provide its co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation. Another means to control T cell activation is by expressing factors that down-regulate T cell activation. Signaling by activated T cell receptors induces expression of CTLA-4, a receptor that opposes T cell activation. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity than CD28 for B7 proteins, terminating T cell activation. ICOS is a protein related to CD28 that is only expressed on activated T cells, and that provides another important co-stimulatory signal. The requirement for co-stimulatory signals provides additional control mechanisms that prevent inappropriate and hazardous T cell activation."
BIOCARTA_CXCR4_PATHWAY,CXCR4 Signaling Pathway,"CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor in the GPCR gene family, and is expressed by cells in the immune system and the central nervous system. In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role in lymphocyte chemotaxis in response to these signals. One endpoint of CXCR4 signaling is the activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and chemokine regulated genes. JAK/STAT signaling pathways also appear to play a role in SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. Delineation of the signaling mechanisms utilized by CXCR4 may assist in determining the role of CXCR4 in HIV infection and in the immune response."
BIOCARTA_CYTOKINE_PATHWAY,Cytokine Network,"Several different cell types coordinate their efforts as part of the immune system, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. Each of these cell types has a distinct role in the immune system, and communicates with other immune cells using secreted factors called cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, and the interferons. Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and are antigen-presenting cells, using cytokines to stimulate specific antigen dependent responses by B and T cells and non-specific responses by other cell types. T cells secrete a variety of factors to coordinate and stimulate immune responses to specific antigen, such as the role of helper T cells in B cell activation in response to antigen. The proliferation and activation of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils respond to cytokines as well. Cytokine communication is often local, within a tissue or between cells in close proximity. Each of the cytokines is secreted by one set of cells and provokes a response in another target set of cells, often including the cell that secretes the cytokine. Some cytokines, like IL-1, interferons and TNF, stimulate a broad inflammatory response in response to infection or injury. Other cytokines have more specific functions such the following examples. IL-2 stimulates the proliferation and activation of B and T cells. IL-4 plays a role in the differentiation of Th2 cells, in allergic responses, and in the switching of antibody types. IL-5 stimulates the production and maturation of eosinophils during inflammation. IL-8 is a chemokine, a chemotactic factor that attracts neutrophils, basophils and T cells to sites of inflammation. IL-12 and IL-18 are involved in helper T cell differentiation. IL-10 apparently acts to repress secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The complex interplay of these different cytokine functions with immune cells is essential for correct immune function."
BIOCARTA_D4GDI_PATHWAY,D4-GDI Signaling Pathway,"D4-GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) is a negative regulator of the ras related Rho Family of GTPases. Since the rho GTPases promote cytoskeletal and membrane changes associated with apoptotic cell death, the removal of the D4-GDI block through its cleavage is important for inducing apoptosis. Caspase-3 cleaves the 28 kDa mature form of D4-GDI to give a 5 kDa and 23 kDa Size fragment. The 23 kDa fragment then translocates to the nucleus. The mechanisms involving cleavage of D4-GDI with apoptosis are not presently known. Activation of the Jun N-Terminal kinase, a regulator of apoptosis, may be one of the mechanisms."
BIOCARTA_DC_PATHWAY,Dendritic cells in regulating TH1 and TH2 Development,"While T cells and B cells carry out the actions of antigen-specific immune responses, antigen-presenting cells called dendritic cells are required for this to happen. The name of dendritic cells is based on their shape, with activated dendritic cells displaying long processes on their surface. When immature dendritic cells found throughout the body internalize and present antigen, they express markers that stimulate the activation of lymphocytes, and migrate to lymphocyte rich tissues like the spleen and lymph nodes to initiate immune responses. In addition to stimulating responses against antigens, dendritic cells also produce tolerance to self antigens. Dendritic cells can be derived from either myeloid or lymphoid lineages. Monocyte derived lineages (pDC1) stimulate Th1 cell differentiation while plasmacytoid (lymphoid) dendritic cells (pDC2) induce Th2 cell differentiation. Factors that stimulate the maturation of monocytes derived dendritic cells include GM-CSF, and IL-4. IL-3 stimulates the differentiation of pDC2 cells into DC2 cells. A variety of factors are involved in antigen-recognition and processing by immature dendritic cells and in the maturation of these cells. The transition to mature dendritic cells down-regulates the factors involved in antigen internalization, and increases the expression of MHC, costimulatory molecules involved in lymphocyte activation, adhesion molecules, and specific cytokines and chemokines. Toll-like receptors on the surface of immature dendritic cells recognize microbial components to induce dendritic cell maturation. In addition to stimulating B cell responses, dendritic cells are potent activators of T cells. IL-12 secretion by dendritic cells stimulates T cell responses, particularly differentiation of Th1 cells that produce interferon-gamma and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. While IL-4 generally stimulates Th2 differentiation, the stimulation of Th2 cell formation by DC2 cells does not appear to involve IL-4. The stimulation of Th1 and Th2 cell formation by dendritic cells appears to be balanced by counter-regulation of each pathway by the other. Interferon-gamma produced by Th1 cells blocks the further stimulation of Th1 differentiation by DC1 cells. The IL-4 produced by Th2 cells kills dendritic cell precursors that contribute to Th2 cell creation. Direct interactions between T cells and dendritic cells are enhanced through the expression of adhesion molecules and costimulatory receptors CD80 and CD86 expressed by mature dendritic cells activate T cells in concert with the recognition of antigen/MHC by the T cell receptor. The central role of dendritic cells as modulators of immune responses makes them an important focus of studies about autoimmune disease, transplant rejection, allergies, responses to infections, and other alterations of the immune response."
BIOCARTA_DEATH_PATHWAY,Induction of apoptosis through DR3 and DR4/5 Death Receptors,"Apoptosis is specifically induced via signaling through a family of receptors known collectively as 'death receptors' including Fas, TNFR, DR3, -4 and -5. Death receptor ligands characteristically initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascades. Apo3L recruits initiator caspase 8 via the adapter protein FADD. Caspase 8 then oligomerizes and is activated via autocatalysis. Activated caspase 8 stimulates apoptosis via two parallel cascades: it directly cleaves and activates caspase-3, and it cleaves Bid (a Bcl-2 family protein). Truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria, inducing cytochrome C release, which sequentially activates caspases 9 and 3. DR-3L can deliver pro- or anti-apoptotic signals. DR-3 promote apoptosis via the adaptor proteins TRADD/FADD and the activation of caspase 8. Alternatively, apoptosis inhibited via an adaptor protein complex including RIP which activates NF-kB and induces survival genes including IAP. Induction of apoptosis via Apo2L requires caspase activity, but the adaptor requirement is unclear."
BIOCARTA_DICER_PATHWAY,Dicer Pathway, 
BIOCARTA_DNAFRAGMENT_PATHWAY,Apoptotic DNA fragmentation and tissue homeostasis,"Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF/CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF/CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the EndoG pathway still occurs in cells lacking DFF."
BIOCARTA_DREAM_PATHWAY,Repression of Pain Sensation by the Transcriptional Regulator DREAM,"The molecular events that lead to the perception of pain are a key research field in medicine and drug discovery. The opioid receptors modulate pain signaling in response to endogenous peptide ligands and opiate drugs such as morphine. The kappa opioid receptor plays a key role in the profound analgesia of opiates and is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand dynorphin, encoded by the prodynorphin gene. Production of prodynorphin is transcriptionally regulated by a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the prodynorphin gene. A transcription factor called DREAM (DRE antagonistic modulator) binds to the DRE and represses prodynorphin transcription when bound. DREAM binds calcium with 4 EF-hand motifs and the binding of DREAM to DNA is repressed in the presence of calcium. Many transcription factors are regulated by calcium indirectly through calcium sensitive kinases and phosphatases, but DREAM is unique to date in being a transcription factor that directly binds calcium and is regulated by calcium binding. DREAM may also regulate other genes such as c-fos. DREAM is expressed in spinal cord neurons in regions involved in pain signaling. The regulation of prodynorphin expression by DREAM also leads to the hypothesis that DREAM is involved in pain signaling. Transgenic mice lacking the DREAM gene were unusually pain insensitive and had elevated spinal levels of dynorphin and tonic activation of the kappa opioid receptor, supporting this hypothesis. Other functions of DREAM may exist such as regulation of presenilins and potassium channel activity in the heart. DREAM is also known as calsenilin and KChIP3 through its association with these other proteins. These processes were not affected in mice lacking the DREAM gene however."
BIOCARTA_DSP_PATHWAY,Regulation of MAP Kinase Pathways Through Dual Specificity Phosphatases, 
BIOCARTA_ECM_PATHWAY,Erk and PI-3 Kinase Are Necessary for Collagen Binding in Corneal Epithelia,"Activation of the MAPK kinase pathway has been identified as a mechanism that integrins use to regulate gene expression leading to cell shape changes during cell spreading or migration Epithelial cells respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cause integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates the surrounding proteins (paxillin, Fyn/shc, and src) and leads to signal amplification. FAK also binds PI-3 kinase and is upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. When MAPkinase or PI-3 kinase was inhibited, actin reorganization was blocked. Src phosphorylates p190RhoGAP, inactivating its GAP function that may allow RhoGTP to stay active longer, promoting further signal amplification. Activated RhoGTP binds to downstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (p160ROCK) and p140 diaphanous (p140Dia) to increase actin polymerization and contraction. Actin reorganization assists integrin clustering, allowing more ECM binding that increase FAK phosphorylation and other signal transduction events."
BIOCARTA_EDG1_PATHWAY,Phospholipids as signalling intermediaries,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an example of lipid messengers with both intracellular and extracellular functions. Intracellularly S1P regulates proliferation and survival; extracellularly S1P is a ligand for EDG1 (also known as S1P1). Activation of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, increases cellular levels of S1P. Inhibitors of SPHK block formation of S1P and inhibit cellular proliferation induced by a variety of factors, including as an example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PMA. In a study using endothelial cells it was demonstrated that S1P induces activation of alpha-v and B3 integrins via RhoA. S1P also activates Akt via Gi and PI3K. The activated Akt phosphorlyates the Edg1 receptor on threonine 236 leading to the activation of Rac1 and subsequent signals leading to actin assembly, chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation. Edg1 stimulation also leads to the activation of the ERK signaling cascade resulting in anti-apoptotic reversal, proliferation and cell survival."

BIOCARTA_EGF_PATHWAY,EGF Signaling Pathway,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide induces cellular proliferation through the EGF receptor, which has a tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain involved in EGF binding and receptor dimerization. Inhibitors of the EGF receptor are being pursued as potential cancer therapies and EGF may stimulate wound healing. Mutation of the EGF receptor has been associated with cancer in humans. The proliferative effects of EGF are signaled through several pathways. Binding of EGF results in EGF receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. The EGF receptor activates ras and the MAP kinase pathway, ultimately causing phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Fos to create AP-1 and ELK-1 that contribute to proliferation. Activation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 transcription factors by JAK kinases in response to EGF contributes to proliferative signaling. Phosphatidylinositol signaling and calcium release induced by EGF activate protein kinase C, another component of EGF signaling. Crosstalk of EGF signaling with other pathways make the EGF receptor a junction point between signaling systems."
BIOCARTA_EGFR_SMRTE_PATHWAY,Map Kinase Inactivation of SMRT Corepressor,"Corepressors are coregulators that interact with transcriptional silencers in a variety of pathways such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Abnormal corepressor-silencer interactions have been implicated in a variety of human disease pathways including several types of leukemia. The regulation of the SMRT corepressor via the p38 and Mek-1 Kinase pathway is shown in this diagram. The EFG receptor represents one mechanism by which SMRT function is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. The MEKK1 and p38 pathways are activated by EGF resulting in cross-regulation of SMRT. The induction of SMRT phosphorylation by each pathway is shown, causing SMRT to unbind from the transcription factor complexes represented by RXR, RAR, T3R and PLZF."
BIOCARTA_EICOSANOID_PATHWAY,Eicosanoid Metabolism, 
BIOCARTA_EIF2_PATHWAY,Regulation of eIF2,"Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the control of translation by eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). eIF-2 binds GTP and Met-tRNAi and transfers the Met-tRNA to the 40S subunit, to form the 43S preinitiation complex. Later in the cycle, prior to elongation, the bound GTP is hydrolyzed , releasing eIF-2-GDP. For eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, GDP must be exchanged for GTP, a reaction catalyzed by eIF-2B. Kinases activated by viral infection (PKR), endoplasmic reticulum stress (PERK/PEK), amino acid deprivation (GCN2), and hemin deficiency (HRI) can phosphorylate the a subunit of eIF-2. This phosphorylation stabilizes the eIF-2-GDP-eIF-2B complex, inhibiting the turnover of eIF-2B. eIF-2B is also inhibited by GSK-3b phosphorylation. These events result in a shut-down of cellular protein synthesis and can lead to apoptosis."
BIOCARTA_EIF4_PATHWAY,Regulation of eIF4e and p70 S6 Kinase,"eIF-4F and p70 S6 kinase play critical roles in translational regulation. eIF-4F is a complex whose functions include the recognition of the mRNA 5' cap structure (eIF-4E), delivery of an RNA helicase to the 5' region (eIF-4A), bridging of the mRNA and the ribosome (eIF-4G), and circularization of the mRNA via interaction between eIF-4G and the poly(A) binding protein (PABP). Several stimuli, including growth factors and cytokines, regulate the eIF-4 complex and p70 S6 kinase by initiating a phosphorylation cascade involving the sequential activation of PI3-K, PDK1/2, Akt/PKB, and FRAP/mTOR kinase. FRAP/mTOR, together with an unidentified kinase, phosphorylates 4E-BP, leading to its dissociation from and activation of eIF-4E. MNK1/2, activated by ERK and p38 MAPK, phosphorylates and activates eIF-4E. Both processes contribute to the association of eIF-4E and eIF-4G to form the active eIF-4F complex, a necessary component of the 48S initiation complex. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 by p70 S6 kinase stimulates the translation of mRNAs with a 5' oligopyrimidine tract which typically encode components of the protein synthesis."
BIOCARTA_EIF_PATHWAY,Eukaryotic protein translation,The scanning translation initiation model suggests that 40S ribosomal subunit preloaded with factors bind to the 5 end of the mRNA near the cap. The 48S subunit moves along the mRNA until it finds the initiation triplet and in complex with tRNA and 60S subunit formed the first peptide bond. Translation control is mostly regulated at the protein initiation step through translation initiation factors such as eIF2 or eIF4.

BIOCARTA_EPHA4_PATHWAY,Eph Kinases and ephrins support platelet aggregation,"Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in platelet activation. Clustering Eph kinases or ephrins in platelets stimulated cytoskeletal changes as well as other markers of platelet activation during clotting such as secretion of alpha-granules to release clotting factors. Clustering ephrins together activated Rap1b, a ras gene family member that may regulate integrins. Platelet activation caused Eph kinases to bind to src family members Fyn and Lyn and also with the cell adhesion molecule L1. Failure of the ephrins/Eph kinase pathway to function normally in platelets may result in loosely associated platelets and improper clot formation. Eph kinases and ephrins are also expressed on the vascular wall by endothelial cells, suggesting that signaling by these proteins may also play a role in the interaction of platelets with the vascular wall and clot formation in the vasculature."
BIOCARTA_EPO_PATHWAY,EPO Signaling Pathway,"Erythropoietin functions to increase the number of red blood cells. Thus, it has found utility as a drug for those needing to replenish erythrocytes for a number of reasons. The signaling mechanism includes multimerization of the receptor upon ligand binding, activation of MAPK cascade, and phosphorylation and activation of Stat5."
BIOCARTA_EPONFKB_PATHWAY,Erythropoietin mediated neuroprotection through NF-kB,"Erythropoietin (Epo) is most commonly known as the cytokine secreted by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production and is used as a drug for the treatment of anemias. Epo is also secreted in the brain in response to hypoxia, such as ischemic stroke. Epo production in the brain is stimulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Administration of Epo to the brain in rodents before hypoxic stress or other neuronal stresses is neuroprotective, preventing neuronal apoptosis. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is known to associate with JAK kinases that phosphorylate and activate the STAT family of transcription factors. The neuroprotection by Epo involves cross-talk between Epo receptor and anti-apoptotic pathways through activation of NF-kB by the JAK2 kinase. Epo stimulates JAK2 phosphorylation of I-kB, releasing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of neuroprotective genes. Neuroprotective genes activated by NF-kB include the anti-oxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase and calbindin-D(28k). The erythropoietin receptor is also essential for proper brain development in mice. The absence of EpoR causes high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the developing mouse brain, further confirming the important role of Epo as a neuroprotective agent."

BIOCARTA_ERK5_PATHWAY,Role of Erk5 in Neuronal Survival,"Axons extend significant distances to innervate target tissues. At the site of innervation, target tissues release neurotrophins including NGF, BDNF and neurotrophin-3 that stimulate the survival of the associated neuron. Local signaling by activated Trk receptors at the synaptic terminus mediates some presynaptic neuronal responses to neurotrophins. Map kinase pathways activated by Trk receptor activate Erk1 and Erk2 at the terminus stimulating axonal growth, and PI3K activates AKT in the terminus as well. Activation of these kinases does not propagate a signal to the cell body though and does not induce a transcriptional response. This local signaling at the terminus or local signaling at the cell body appears distinct from the signaling pathway that transduces the survival signal from the target tissue. Retrograde axonal transport plays an essential role in neuronal survival induced by neurotrophins released at the target tissue. Failure of retrograde neurotrophin signaling may play a role in neurodegenerative conditions. The neuronal survival signal is initiated by binding of neurotrophins to Trk receptors in the presynaptic membrane, then travels back along the axon to the neuronal cell body. To transmit the signal back along the axon, activated Trk receptors are internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis and receptor containing vesicles then rapidly travel back to the cell body along axonal microtubules. Several reports indicate that neurotrophins remain receptor-bound during the retrograde axonal transport to the cell body, but recently it was reported that retrograde transport of NGF was not required to induce neuronal survival. Once in the cell body, Trk receptors activate multiple pathways. A key pathway activated by Trk after retrograde transport involves Erk5, also called BMK1. Trk activates Mek5, which activates Erk5, inducing phosphorylation of the CREB and Mef2 transcription factors. Erk5 does not directly phosphorylate CREB, but translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates the kinase Rsk, which phosphorylates CREB in turn. Both CREB and Mef2 induce a transcriptional program that contributes to neuronal survival. Local activation of Erk5 on the cell body does not appear to induce the same signaling system or neuronal survival, indicating that the retrograde transport is an essential part of the survival signaling system. Also, activation of Erk1 and Erk2 in the cell body can induce CREB activation and neuronal survival, but these kinases are not activated by neurotrophins applied to the axonal terminus. Another pathway activated by retrograde neurotrophin signaling though Erk5 is PI3 Kinase."
BIOCARTA_ERK_PATHWAY,Erk1/Erk2 Mapk Signaling pathway,"The p44/42 MAP Kinase pathway consists of a protein kinase cascade linking growth and differentiation signals with transcription in the nucleus. Growth factor receptors and tyrosine kinases activate Ras which in turn activates c-Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. Activated p44/42 MAP Kinase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription by phosphorylation of kinases such as p90 RSK, MSK, and transcription factors such as ELK-1 and Stat3. The importance of this pathway in both growth control and development has been demonstrated via the transforming properties of various mutant forms of Ras, Raf, MEK and by their effects on development. Signal amplification and the potential for crosstalk appear to be important features of this regulatory network."
BIOCARTA_ERYTH_PATHWAY,Erythrocyte Differentiation Pathway,"Stem cells in the bone marrow produce a variety of hematopoietic cell types from common progenitor cells under the influence of cytokines and growth factors. CFU-GEMM cells are a key intermediate in the differentiation of granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes and megakaryocytes. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine produced in the kidneys that, along with other cytokines, induces red blood cell (erythrocyte) differentiation in the bone marrow from CFU-GEMM cells. As the erythrocyte lineage progresses, cells lose their nuclei, and move out of the bone marrow into circulation. The ability of EPO to selectively induce red blood cell differentiation has allowed extensive therapeutic use of the recombinant form of this cytokine to treat anemias."
BIOCARTA_ETC_PATHWAY,Electron Transport Reaction in Mitochondria,"The body gets energy through the oxidation of food such as glucose and fatty acids. The chemical energy contained in these foods is extracted and converted until it reaches a common form, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable and is coupled to a variety of energetically unfavorable processes to drive them forward. How is the energy of glucose captured and converted to make ATP? Most of the energy of glucose or fatty acids is extracted through oxidation to produce the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. From there, the energy is transferred next to the electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chain includes a series of protein complexes and non-membrane cofactors that transfer the electrons from NADH and FADH2 in a series of redox reactions from carrier to carrier. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the chain, resulting in the production of water. The oxygen we breath, and which is transported by hemoglobin in the blood to all of the tissues, serves this purpose and allows electron transport to occur. As the electrons pass through the chain, they transfer their energy to the complexes, which use the energy to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix, creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The chemical energy that started with glucose, and was transferred to NADH and FADH2, is then converted to the energy of a concentration gradient. The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to protons on its own, so the energy of the proton gradient is stable, waiting to be recaptured. The energy is recaptured by ATP synthase in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme allows protons to flow back down their concentration gradient across the membrane, and in the process uses the energy of the gradient to drive ATP synthesis. The movement of the electrons through electron transport, the proton gradient and ATP synthesis are all coupled processes that require each other to occur. The cell does not store energy as ATP, but only has enough ATP on hand for its immediate energy needs. If electron transport ceases or is inhibited, then ATP synthesis also rapidly halts. This regulation ensures that ATP production closely matches the needs of the cell. Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are also closely linked to the energy needs of the cell. The abundance of ATP, NADH and pathway intermediates regulates key steps in these pathways so that are activated when energy is required to feed the electron transport system and they are inhibited when not needed to save metabolic energy. If oxygen is absent, electron transport and the Kreb's cycle rapidly halt, leaving glycolysis and fermentation as the main means of energy production. During aerobic exercise, the rapid consumption of ATP leads to use of the proton gradient to make more ATP, increased electron transport to regenerate the proton gradient, increased oxygen consumption, and increased activity of the Kreb's cycle and glycolysis to supply high energy electrons to drive electron transport. Uncoupling agents allow protons to flow across the mitochondrial membrane without producing ATP. The chemical compound dinitrophenol (DNP), for example, can transport protons to flow across the inner mitochondrial membrane without ATP synthase. In the presence of dinitrophenol, energy is consumed to pump protons out of mitochondria, but this energy is not recaptured in chemical form in ATP. Instead, this energy is released as heat. Dinitrophenol was once used as diet remedy to lose weight without exercise or diet, but this compound is a metabolic poison and resulted in deaths in when purposefully given to humans. Proteins also can act as uncoupling agents in the mitochondria. A mitochondrial uncoupling protein is found in brown adipose tissue. An increase in the activity of uncoupling proteins increases heat production by allowing protons to flow down their gradient without making ATP and may serve as protection against cold, as well as a potential means of obesity control."
BIOCARTA_ETS_PATHWAY,METS affect on Macrophage Differentiation,"Terminal differentiation of cells is often accompanied by repression of cellular proliferation, suggesting that there is a mechanism by which these cellular functions are coordinated. Macrophage differentiation is one model system in which this occurs; as macrophages differentiate, they also stop proliferating. Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in cell cycle progression as well as many differentiation processes. Ras stimulates cell cycle progression in part through Ets transcription factors that bind to cell cycle regulatory genes to activate their expression. Ets transcription factors also help to induce early macrophage differentiation. The activation of Ras signaling by M-CSF activates transcription of genes involved in differentiation through the coordinate expression of both Ets factors and AP-1. Other genes involved in cell cycle regulation involved the coordinate action of E2F-1 and Ets transcription factors. Mets is a factor related in sequence to Ets2 that is upregulated during macrophage differentiation. Increased expression of the Mets protein during macrophage differentiation allows the creation of heterodimers with DP103 to act as transcriptional repressors of cell cycle progression genes, recruiting corepressor to promoters they interact with. DP103 is a gene previously identified as an RNA helicase involved in RNA processing that interacts with EBNA factors from Epstein Barr Virus. The transcriptional repression involving Mets with DP103 is selective, and does not involve all Ets regulated genes. While cell cycle genes are repressed by Mets, other gene activated by Ets factors such as those involved in differentiation are not repressed by Mets. The transcriptional repression by Mets also involved members of the Rb family of tumor suppressors, such as p107 and p130. This requirement for additional factors involved in regulating proliferation may allow for another level of control on cell proliferation and coordination with differentiation."
BIOCARTA_EXTRINSIC_PATHWAY,Extrinsic Prothrombin Activation Pathway,"Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The extrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to vascular walls or extravascular tissues. The damaged tissue releases tissue thromboplastin also known as tissue factor (TF). The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes as little as 15 seconds. This cascade is initiated by the activation of factor X by TF and factor VII. Activated factor X combined with factor V, factor VII and TF constitutes the prothrombin activator. Calcium (Ca++) is required for each of these steps. The prothrombin activator in the extrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the intrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also the step leading to the activation of factor X. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin. Protein C is activated by thrombin and with the Protein S cofactor provides a strong negative feedback in this phase of clot formation. Disease Significance: Most of the clotting factors are formed in the liver. Diseases of the liver or damage to the liver can depress the levels of these factors in the blood resulting in excessive bleeding. Vitamin K deficiency can also result in a similar condition since Vitamin K is essential for the formation of factor VII, IX, X and prothrombin. Vitamin K is synthesized in the intestinal tract by bacteria."
BIOCARTA_FAS_PATHWAY,FAS signaling pathway ( CD95 ),"Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK kinase, activation of Jun, and production of ceramide may also play roles in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Activation of fas-mediated apoptosis is opposed by I-FLICE and FAP. Viruses and tumors may escape immune surveillance in part through suppression of fas-mediated apoptosis using similar mechanisms."

BIOCARTA_FEEDER_PATHWAY,Feeder Pathways for Glycolysis,"The glycolytic pathway begins with the simple sugar glucose and leads to pyruvate and eventually the Kreb's cycle. Dietary carbohydrates include a variety of sugars that are funneled into glycolysis to supply energy, including other monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides like starch. Fructose is an abundant monosaccharide in fruit, and is also found along with glucose in the common disaccharide sucrose. Fructose enters glycolysis by different pathways in the liver and muscle. In muscle, fructose is a substrate of hexokinase, like glucose, and enters the pathway directly as fructose 6-phosphate. In liver, hexokinase is present in very low levels and fructose passes through a more complex pathway. Fructose is first phosphorylated to form fructose 1-phosphate, which is then split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to enter glycolysis as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The sugar mannose also enters glycolysis at this point, first being converted to mannose 6-phosphate that is then isomerized to produce fructose 6-phosphate. Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk, and is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose only differs from glucose in its stereochemistry at one position, but must be converted to glucose to enter glycolysis. The first step is phosphorylation to produce galactose 1-phosphate. Then, a UDP nucleotide group is exchanged between galactose 1-phosphate and UDP-glucose. The result of this reaction is the production of glucose 1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. UDP-galactose is enzymatically converted to UDP-glucose, which is then converted to glucose 1-phosphate in the next round of this loop. Glucose 1-phosphate is isomerized to produce glucose 6-phosphate, part of the glycolytic pathway. The complex polysaccharides starch and glycogen differ in their source and in their structure (they have different bonds between each individual sugar unit) but they are both composed entirely of glucose subunits polymerized together. Starch is found in plants and is digested to release individual glucose molecules in the digestive tract that are absorbed and transported to the tissues. Glycogen is the main storage carbohydrate in animals, and is mobilized by liver and muscle to release glucose when hormones like adrenalin indicate that a burst of energy is required. When glucose is mobilized from glycogen, it is released as glucose 1-phosphate. In muscle, there is no enzyme present that converts glucose 1-phosphate to glucose, so the only fate of this glucose 1-phosphate is to enter glycolysis after being converted glucose 6-phosphate. Deficiencies in the enzymes that direct sugars into glycolysis have distinct clinical effects in some cases. Lactose intolerance is very common in many parts of the world, and is caused in adults by a reduction in the enzyme that breaks lactose down into galactose and glucose in the intestine. Some individuals suffer from the genetic condition galactosemia, in which they lack the enzymes to convert galactose to glucose. The accumulation of galactose leads to mental retardation, liver damage and cataracts unless dietary intake of galactose is controlled."
BIOCARTA_FIBRINOLYSIS_PATHWAY,Fibrinolysis Pathway,"Clot formation and fibrinolysis is a balance of plasmin activation/inhibition and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity that regulates fibrin polymer formation and degradation. Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). The presence of fibrin fibers and fibrin degradation products exert a two-fold stimulation of tPA and uPA. Plasmin activity is also inhibited by alpha2-antiplasmin. Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a carboxy-peptidase B-like proenzyme activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin dimer. TAFI cleaves (DD)E2 to separate DD and E fragments which do not enhance the activation of tPA or uPA and results in a reduced feedback signal. Disease Significance: Overabundance or increased activity of the plamsminogen activator inhibitors or reduced presence or function of tPA or uPA can result in atherosclerotic disease and venous thrombosis due to an increase in fibrin deposition or formation of a thrombus. Thrombosis can also result from plasminogen deficiency caused by a lack of protein or lack of functional protein. Reduced or depleted levels of alpha2-antiplamin can result in severe bleeding disorders."

BIOCARTA_FMLP_PATHWAY,fMLP induced chemokine gene expression in HMC-1 cells,"Neutrophils respond to bacterial infection by releasing reactive oxygen species that kill bacteria and by expressing chemokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection. The multisubunit enzyme NADPH oxidase expressed by neutrophils produces reactive oxygen species rapidly released in what is known as the respiratory burst. Activity of the NADPH oxidase is induced by fMLP receptor ligands, formylated peptides from bacteria. The fMLP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, FPR-1, that activates Map kinase pathways and phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation releases IP3 and calcium, activating protein kinase C and also activating the transcription factor NFAT, which contributes to activation of chemokine genes. One of the components of the NADPH oxidase is p47phox. PKC activation phosphorylates p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase activity. Activation of Map kinase cascades leads to Erk1/Erk2 dependent p47phox phosphorylation as well as activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and chemokine gene expression. Inhibition of p38 did not affect p47phox phosphorylation, indicating that p38 is not involved in Erk1/2 activation of the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of p38 did inhibit NADPH oxidase though, indicating that other pathways contribute to activation of this enzyme. The pathways involved in neutrophils activation are important to understand innate immune responses to bacterial infection."
BIOCARTA_FOSB_PATHWAY,FOSB gene expression and drug abuse, 
BIOCARTA_FREE_PATHWAY,Free Radical Induced Apoptosis,"Oxidative stress is one factor that can trigger programmed cell death. Activated neutrophils responding to inflammatory stimulation produce reactive oxygen species like superoxide free radicals to kill invading bacteria, but these reactive oxygen species can also attack endothelial cells lining the vascular wall and trigger apoptosis. Endothelial cells also produce reactive oxygen species inside the cell that can contribute to oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as during reperfusion injury following ischemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts highly reactive and damaging superoxide free radicals to peroxides that are less reactive than superoxide but stimulate apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) peptide reducing agent removes toxic metabolites and repairs damage created by reactive oxygen species. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), for example, removes peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent, and glutathione reductase (GSR) regenerates reduced glutathione. Inside the endothelial cell peroxide can be converted to hydroxyl ions in the presence of iron. Peroxides and hydroxyl radicals activate NF-kB and activate expression of inflammatory genes including adhesion molecules, TNF and IL-8. The apoptotic response of endothelial cells to oxidative stress may be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis."

BIOCARTA_G1_PATHWAY,Cell Cycle: G1/S Check Point,"The G1/S cell cycle checkpoint controls the passage of eukaryotic cells from the first 'gap' phase (G1) into the DNA synthesis phase (S). Two cell cycle kinases, CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E, and the transcription complex that includes Rb and E2F are pivotal in controlling this checkpoint. During G1 phase, the Rb-HDAC repressor complex binds to the E2F-DP1 transcription factors, inhibiting the downstream transcription. Phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4/6 and CDK2 dissociates the Rb-repressor complex, permitting transcription of S-phase genes encoding for proteins that amplify the G1 to S phase switch and that are required for DNA replication. Many different stimuli exert checkpoint control including TGFb, DNA damage, contact inhibition, replicative senescence, and growth factor withdrawal. The first four act by inducing members of the INK4 or Kip/Cip families of cell cycle kinase inhibitors. TGFb additionally inhibits the transcription of Cdc25A, a phosphatase that activates the cell cycle kinases. Growth factor withdrawal activates GSK3b, which phosphorylates cyclin D, leading to its rapid ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation are mechanisms commonly used to rapidly reduce the concentration of cell-cycle control proteins."
BIOCARTA_G2_PATHWAY,Cell Cycle: G2/M Checkpoint,"The G2/M DNA damage checkpoint prevents the cell from entering mitosis (M phase) if the genome is damaged. The Cdc2-cyclin B kinase is pivotal in regulating this transition. During G2 phase, Cdc2 is maintained in an inactive state by the kinases Wee1 and Mt1. As cells approach M phase, the phosphatase Cdc25 is activated, perhaps by the polo-kinase Pik1. Cdc25 then activates Cdc2, establishing a feedback amplification loop that efficiently drives the cell into mitosis. DNA damage activates the DNA-PK/ATM/ATR kinases, initiating two parallel cascades that inactivate Cdc2-cyclin B. The first cascade rapidly inhibits progression into mitosis: the CHK kinases phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc25, which can no longer activate Cdc2. The second cascade is slower. Phosphorylation of p53 dissociates it from MDM2, activating its DNA binding activity. Acetylation by p300/PCAF further activates its transcriptional activity. The genes that are turned on by p53 constitute effectors of this second cascade. They include 14-3-3s, which binds to the phosphorylated Cdc2-cyclin B kinase and exports it from the nucleus; GADD45, which apparently binds to and dissociates the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase; and p21Cip1, an inhibitor of a subset of the cyclin-dependent kinases including Cdc2 (CDK1)."
BIOCARTA_GABA_PATHWAY,Gamma-aminobutyric Acid Receptor Life Cycle,"Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts at synapses through binding to ligand-gated ion channels, the GABA receptors. Clustering of the GABA-A receptor chloride channel alters receptor pharmacology on the cell surface and reduced clustering of the GABA receptor is associated with anxiety. GABA-A interacts with several proteins that modulate its clustering, endocytosis, and recycling or degradation. Plic-1 is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to GABA-A receptors and causes them to accumulate at inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of GABA-A, and with microtubules, bringing receptors together in plasma microdomains. Curiously, Gephyrin appears to be a bifunctional protein, with a domain involved in molybdenum metabolism. Another protein interacting with the GABA-A receptor is GABARAP, a microtubule-associated protein. Anchoring of the GABA-A receptor to GABARAP helps to cluster the receptor at the synaptic termini and to mediate fast synaptic transmission. GABARAP may mediate interaction of gephyrin with the GABA-A receptor and gephyrin may stabilize clusters by forming multimeric structures. GABARAP and gephyrin may play more of a role in receptor sorting and transport to the cell surface than in anchoring to the cytoplasm, since at inhibitory synapses GABARAP appears to associated with transport vesicles rather than the cell surface. The association of GABARAP with NSF (N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor), a protein involved in intracellular vesicle transport, supports this hypothesis."
BIOCARTA_GATA3_PATHWAY,GATA3 participate in activating the Th2 cytokine genes expression,"CD4+ helper T cells differentiate into distinct subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells. Th2 cells are involved in the response to extracellular helminthe parasites and allergic responses and secrete a distinct set of cytokines including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. The development and differentiation of T cells is influenced by many factors, including transcription factors such as GATA-3, a transcription factor associated with induction of Th2 cells. Factors that increase cAMP levels in Th2 cells activate p38 kinase, which phosphorylates and activates GATA-3 independently of PKA. Cells expressing GATA-3 develop the profile of Th2 cells, secreting IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. These cytokines are found in a gene cluster together and are regulated coordinately by GATA-3. Binding of GATA-3 in the regulatory regions of these genes alters chromatin structure, increasing accessibility to other transcription factors. Activation of the T cell receptor through interaction with antigen on antigen presenting cells activates NFAT and other transcription factors that cooperate with GATA-3 in inducing Th2 cell differentiation. Dominant negative GATA-3 can repress the secretion of these cytokines and block the airway inflammation that causes asthma. Blocking GATA-3 action such as through antisense treatment has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to treat asthma. GATA-3 has also been implicated in developmental processes such as the development of the inner ear."
BIOCARTA_GCR_PATHWAY,Corticosteroids and cardioprotection,"Myocardial infarction damages heart tissue both during the initial ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion of tissues with oxygen. Corticosteroids can protect cardiac tissue from damage following a heart attack, but the mechanisms by which corticosteroids are cardioprotective have not been clear and negative side effects such as reduced wound healing may result from their use. Corticosteroids exert a variety of actions through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. GR acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, but some of the cardioprotective effects mediated by GR-bound corticosteroids are non-transcriptional in nature. Glucocorticoids are commonly used as anti-inflammatory drugs in a variety of conditions, and some of their effects in the heart result from inhibition of the inflammatory response of heart tissue to ischemia and reperfusion. NF-kB is a transcription factor involved in signaling by inflammatory factors such as TNF, and is repressed by glucocorticoids. Annexin-1 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein whose expression is induced by corticosteroids and inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into tissue, blocking reperfusion-induced inflammatory heart damage. A non-transcriptional cardioprotective effect of glucocorticoids is activation of NO production by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Glucocorticoids activate eNOS through activation of PI3 kinase and AKT and increased NO produced by eNOS can diffuse into surrounding tissues to prevent clotting and cause vasodilation. The beta-2 adrenergic receptor can also activate PI3 kinase and may synergize with glucocorticoids in this pathway. The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide secreted by the atrial wall in response to increased atrial pressure such as occurs during cardiac failure and to be decreased by myocardial infarction. Glucocorticoids increase the secretion of ANF by acting at the transcriptional level to increase expression of the pro-ANF peptide, perhaps inducing increased water excretion in the kidneys to reduce blood volume and reduce atrial pressure. The exploration of glucorticoid responses may allow the identification of compounds that retain the cardioprotective activities but do not inhibit wound healing. Alternative mechanisms of eNOS activation may also provide a route to identify cardioprotective drugs."
BIOCARTA_GH_PATHWAY,Growth Hormone Signaling Pathway,"Growth hormone plays a major role in regulating growth during childhood and adolescence and also regulates metabolism. Defects in growth hormone signaling can result in dwarfism and decreases in growth hormone levels with age have been suggested to play a role in the reduced function of some physiological systems. Growth hormone signals a response in cells through the growth hormone receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Growth hormone causes the receptor to dimerize, activating the JAK2 protein kinase. The activity of JAK2 mediates many of the downstream responses to growth hormone through phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, MAP kinases, other kinase cascades and molecules involved in metabolism like IRS-1. Factors like SOCS and SHP-1 appear to play a role in the down regulation of signaling by growth hormone and cytokines."

BIOCARTA_GLEEVEC_PATHWAY,Inhibition of Cellular Proliferation by Gleevec,"The drug Gleevec (also known as imatinib mesylate or STI-571) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of CML, chronic myeloid leukemia. While traditional cytotoxic cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy kill all dividing cells, Gleevec acts on a molecular target by a mechanism that is more specific to cancer cells. Traditional cytotoxic cancer agents have serious side effects such as nausea, weight loss, hair loss and severe fatigue that result from their lack of specificity in killing cells. Gleevec was designed as an inhibitor of a specific receptor associated with CML, and so produces less severe side effects than other cancer agents. CML is associated in most cases with a specific chromosomal defect, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation occurs at the site in the genome of a protein tyrosine kinase called abl, creating the abnormal bcr-abl protein, a fusion of the abl gene with another gene called bcr. The kinase activity of abl in the bcr-abl fusion is activated and unregulated, driving the uncontrolled cell growth observed in CML. White blood cells containing the bcr-abl mutation become able to proliferate in the absence of growth factors they normally require. Gleevec inhibits abl kinase activity, helping to reverse uncontrolled cell growth. Gleevec also inhibits the PDGF tyrosine kinase and the c-kit tyrosine kinase. There are a variety of cellular substrates of the bcr-abl kinase that may be involved in cellular transformation. Bcr-abl is associated with the cytoplasm as part of a large signaling complex. Some of the downstream factors in bcr-abl signaling include PI3 kinase/AKT and STAT transcription factors. The activation of bcr-abl also represses apoptosis through induction of anti-apoptosis factors such as Bad, allowing transformed cells to divide. JAK2 kinase activity appears to be one target of bcr-abl. Grb-2 phosphorylation by bcr-abl may play a role in down-regulation of tyrosine kinase signaling. STAT5 may be involved in the failure of apoptosis in bcr-abl cells. In addition to supporting the idea that cancer therapies targeting specific molecular targets should be efficacious with fewer side effects, Gleevec has also demonstrated that drugs inhibiting protein kinases can be developed successfully. Tyrosine kinases are important in a range of cellular processes, including other cancers, and will provide additional drug targets. Gleevec itself has already demonstrated potential in other cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor that do not respond to existing treatments. Although Gleevec has produced very strong clinical responses in patients with early stage CML, patients with late stage disease have had an initial response followed by a relapse of drug resistant CML cells. Cancer cells in patients with Gleevec resistant cancer either had amplification of the bcr-abl gene, or mutation of a key amino acid involved in binding drug from threonine to isoleucine."
BIOCARTA_GPCR_PATHWAY,Signaling Pathway from G-Protein Families,"G-aS-coupled receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC), which synthesizes cAMP from ATP. In contrast Gai-coupled receptors inhibit AC and so reduce cAMP formation. The bg subunits from Gai and other G proteins are able to activate the MAP kinase pathways and PLCb. GPCRs coupled to the Gaq family of G proteins stimulate PLCb, which cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce IP3, which mobilizes intracellular calcium, and DAG, which activates PKC. Second messenger pathways then activate a range of effector systems to change cell behaviour; in many cases this includes the regulation of gene transcription. Dotted line shows a more indirect pathway."
BIOCARTA_GRANULOCYTES_PATHWAY,Adhesion and Diapedesis of Granulocytes,"Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. During an inflammation or immune reaction, specialized leukocytes (eosinophilic granulocytes) adhere to and pass through the endothelium of the blood vessels and the underlying matrix. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flattening of the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or even through the intercellular matrix. This is mediated by a homophilic interactions of PECAM and CD31."
BIOCARTA_GSK3_PATHWAY,Inactivation of Gsk3 by AKT causes accumulation of b-catenin in Alveolar Macrophages,"Lipopolysaccharide. One of the key actions of AKT is to block apoptosis. AKT phosphorylation of NF-kB promotes the survival and activation of macrophages responding to LPS. Another substrate of AKT is the protein kinase Gsk3-beta. AKT phosphorylates and deactivates Gsk3-beta. Non-phosphorylated Gsk3-beta is active and phosphorylates beta-catenin, leading to its degradation in the ubiquitin dependent proteosome pathway. Stimulation by LPS causes the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus and the activation of genes in concert with the transcription factor LEF1. This pathway is probably not restricted to alveolar pathway, but leads to the activation of beta-catenin dependent genes by LPS in other cells as well. Other pathways regulate this pathway also, such as the modulation of PI3 kinase activity by ceramide, and the inhibition of Gsk3-beta activity by the Wnt/frizzled/disheveled (DSH) pathway."
BIOCARTA_HBX_PATHWAY,Calcium Signaling by HBx of Hepatitis B virus, 
BIOCARTA_HCMV_PATHWAY,Human Cytomegalovirus and Map Kinase Pathways,"To replicate in the host cell, viruses commandeer cellular signaling pathways. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus with that is widespread in the population but usually causes disease only in immunocompromised individuals and is also a viral cause of birth defects. One of the actions of CMV in the host cell is to stimulate MAP kinase pathways. Both p38 and ERK kinases are activated by CMV infection through activation map kinase kinases and inhibition of phosphatases. One result of Map kinase activation by CMV is activation of transcription of viral genes, increasing the production of viral gene products. Both p38 and ERK kinases contribute to the activation of viral genes by cellular transcription factors acting through the viral UL4 promoter at upstream and basal transcription elements. Another target of prolonged p38 activation during infection is Rb, contributing to viral replication. Activation of MKK1 and MKK2 leads to Erk1 and Erk2 activation, and phosphorylation of downstream targets. The MEKK1 kinase regulates the immediate early promoter indirectly through downstream kinase signaling and perhaps more directly through activation of NF-kB. Map kinase pathways activated by CMV converge on increased transcription of viral genes and increased replication of the viral genome. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interaction of CMV with cellular signaling machinery will provide improved ways to treat CMV-mediated disease."
BIOCARTA_HDAC_PATHWAY,Control of skeletal myogenesis by HDAC & calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK),"The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle. Several factors regulate Mef2 transcription factors, including Map kinases and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. Mef2 is phosphorylated by p38 map kinase, and phosphorylation of Mef2c by p38 contributes to skeletal muscle differentiation. BMK-1 (also called Erk5) is another member of the Map kinase family that regulates the activity of Mef2 family members and is unique in that it appears itself to possess a transcriptional activation domain and act as a transcriptional coactivator. Mekk3 disruption prevented normal cardiovascular development in mice and appears to signal through p38 and Mef2c in normal cardiovascular development."
BIOCARTA_HER2_PATHWAY,Role of ERBB2 in Signal Transduction and Oncology,"Her2 or ERBB2 belongs to a class of proteins having high homology with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ERBB1). It encodes a protein with the molecular weight of 185 KDa. Unlike other members of EGFR family, no ligand for Her2 has been found and it usually associates with members of ERBB1 family to form functional heterodimers. It has been shown that it can form dimers with ERBB (EGFR), ERBB3 and ERBB4 as well as gp130 subunits of IL-6 receptor. In at least some cell types, the association between gp130 and HRBB2 is essential for HRBB2-ERBB3 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP kinase signaling. Although ERBB1 can form homodimers, the signaling for ERBB1 is usually transient and the receptor undergoes internalization after ligand binding and activation. EGFR-HER2 complex increases the signaling capacity of EGFR by increasing the ligand affinity as well as the recycling of the heterodimer. Of all the ERBB heterodimers, ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimers perhaps elicit the strongest signal. Removing ERBB3 from the cell has a drastic effect on ERBB2 mediated signaling and downstream effectors. The clinical importance of HER2 cannot be overstated. In addition, monoclonal antibody (Herceptin) against this receptor has been shown to be an effective treatment of breast cancer patients who have a high level of HER2 over expression."
BIOCARTA_HES_PATHWAY,Segmentation Clock, 
BIOCARTA_HIF_PATHWAY,Hypoxia-Inducible Factor in the Cardiovascular System,"Hypoxia (or low O2 levels) affects various pathologies. First, tissue ischemia, a variation in O2 tension caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation, can lead to endothelial cell changes. For example, long periods of ischemia result in endothelial changes, such as vascular leakage, resulting in varicose veins. In more severe situations, ischemia can lead to myocardial or cerebral infarction and retinal vessel occlusion. Of interest, HIF-1 is stabilized prior to induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression during acute ischemia in the human heart. Second, pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic respiratory disorders results from persistent vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. Third, hypoxic gradients created in enlarging solid tumors trigger expression of genes containing hypoxia response element (HRE)s such as those involved in angiogenesis. This allows subsequent delivery of O2, nutrients, and further tumor growth. Vascular remodeling is an important component to tumorigenesis; without proper blood supply, delivery of oxygen may occur by diffusion, but becomes inefficient in tumors greater than 1 mm in diameter. Short-term hypoxia can also elevate platelet numbers, while prolonged exposure may cause some degree of thrombocytopenia in response to increased levels of erythropoetin (EPO). Another disorder involving inadequate responses to hypoxia is preeclampsia, a pathology of pregnancy thought to be caused by improper differentiation of placental trophoblast cells due to poorly controlled O2 tension or improper hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated responses. The primary molecular mechanism of gene activation during hypoxia is through HIF-1. Several genes involved in cellular differentiation are directly or indirectly regulated by hypoxia. These include EPO, LDH-A, ET-1, transferrin, transferrin receptor, VEGF, Flk-1, Flt-1, platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF-), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and others genes affecting glycolysis. HIF-1 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS family of transcription factors known to induce gene expression by binding to a ~50-bp HRE containing a core 5'-ACGTG-3' sequence. bHLH-PAS proteins heterodimerize to form transcription complexes that regulate O2 homeostasis, circadian rhythms, neurogenesis, and toxin metabolism. Three bHLH-PAS proteins in vertebrates respond to hypoxia: HIF-1 , EPAS (HIF-2 ), and HIF-3. These dimerize with ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein), ARNT-2, or ARNT-3. HIF-1 is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded in less than 5 minutes under normoxic conditions. Although several candidate O2-sensing molecules have emerged in the literature, the molecular basis of how cells sense O2 levels is poorly characterized. pVHL, the protein product of a tumor-suppressor gene responsible for von Hippel Lindau disease, is implicated in this O2-sensing system by its association with HIF-1 , targeting it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Similarly, F-box-containing proteins recognize substrates of the ubiquitin ligases, targeting them for phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. In addition to F-boxes, most of these proteins also contain a WD40 or a leucine-rich repeat (LLR) domain that presumably functions as a Ser/Thr binding module. A second family of proteins assisting the ubiquitin ligases share a region designated SOCS-box (originally from the suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins SOCS). Under low O2 (<5% O2) HIF-1 is stabilized leading to the formation of a functional transcription factor complex with ARNT. This complex is the master regulator of O2 homeostasis and induces a network of genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism."
BIOCARTA_HIVNEF_PATHWAY,HIV-I Nef: negative effector of Fas and TNF,"HIV infection leads to drastic declines in CD4 T helper cells, in part through apoptosis of uninfected cells. Apoptosis of uninfected cells may be induced through the expression of Fas ligand on the surface of HIV-infected cells, stimulating the Fas-dependent apoptotic pathway in cells that come in contact with infected cells. The NEF protein expressed by HIV may play induce the expression of Fas-ligand by infected cells. If this is the case, then a question that arises is how infected cells themselves escape Fas-mediated apoptosis. The NEF protein appears to play a role in this process as well. NEF interacts with the ASK1 kinase (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase) involved in apoptotic signaling by TNF and Fas-ligand. Interaction of NEF with ASK1 prevents phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases and JNK kinases involved in apoptotic signaling."
BIOCARTA_HSP27_PATHWAY,Stress Induction of HSP Regulation,"Mammalian cells can respond to a variety of stresses such as heat, cold, oxidative stress, metabolic disturbance, and environmental toxins through necrotic or apoptotic cell death, while increased expression and phosphorylation of heat shock proteins such as Hsp27 can protect cells against cellular stress. Heat shock proteins commonly exhibit molecular chaperone activity and also interact with a wide variety of proteins to exert specific effects. The small heat shock protein Hsp27 exists as monomers, dimers, and oligomers in the cell, and each form has distinct activities. Oligomers are the main form of Hsp27 with molecular chaperone activity and are disrupted by phosphorylation of Hsp27 to form dimers and monomers. S-thiolation of Hsp27 on cysteine also dissociates oligomers and may provide another route of regulating the action of Hsp27 in stress. Map kinase cascades mediate Hsp27 phosphorylation. Heat stress activates the p38 kinase cascade and induces phosphorylation of Hsp27 by the downstream Map kinases Mapkapk2 and Mapkap3. Cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 can also induce Hsp27 phoshorylation through this Map kinase cascade, protecting cells in some settings against cytotoxic responses. In stressful conditions, dissociation of oligomeric Hsp27 by phosphorylation may allow lower molecular weight forms to perform other non-chaperone functions. One action of Hsp27 induced by stress is to protect cells against apoptosis and a common component of apoptotic pathways is the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. One way that Hsp27 reduces apoptosis is by preventing the release of cytochrome c and by binding to cytochrome c in the cytosol. Downstream, Hsp27 also blocks caspase 9 activation and the subsequent activation of caspase 3, inhibiting the rest of the proteolytic caspase cascade. Yet a further role of Hsp27 in blocking apoptosis is through blocking Fas-induced apoptosis. Fas is a receptor in the TNF receptor gene family that induces apoptosis when stimulated by its cell-bound ligand, Fas-ligand. Fas induces apoptosis through two pathways, one mediated by the protein Daxx. Phosphorylated Hsp27 dimers block apoptosis by binding with Daxx and preventing downstream activation of the kinase Ask1. The interaction of Hsp27 with actin filaments may also prevent apoptosis triggered by some agents like staurosporine that damage actin. Unphosphorylated Hsp27 monomers regulate actin filament growth by binding to the end of fibers and capping them. Finally, Hsp27 appears to prevent damage to cells by reactive oxygen species (ROS), by altering the oxidative environment of the cell through induction of glutathione expression, as well as blocking apoptosis induced by ROS. Modulation of Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation may provide a useful means to alter cellular sensitivity to stress."

BIOCARTA_IFNG_PATHWAY,IFN gamma signaling pathway, 
BIOCARTA_IGF1_PATHWAY,IGF-1 Signaling Pathway,"Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) provide a potent proliferative signaling system that stimulates growth in many different cell types and blocks apoptosis. In vivo IGF-1 acts as an intermediate of many growth hormone responses, and may stimulate the growth of some types of cancer. IGF-1 also provides a mitogenic signal to act as a growth factor for many tissue culture cells. One component of IGF-1 mitogenic signaling is association of the receptor tyrosine kinase with Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1 to activate ras and the Map kinase cascade (raf, Mek, Erk). An endpoint of the Map kinase pathway is modification of transcription factor activity, such as activation of ELK transcription factors. Serum response factor (SRF) and AP-1 contribute to mitogenic signaling by many factors. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI3 kinase activation are also involved in IGF-1 signaling, similar to insulin signaling."
BIOCARTA_IGF1MTOR_PATHWAY,Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is regulated via AKT/mTOR pathway,"Skeletal muscle atrophies with disuse while with increased use and increased load skeletal muscle exhibits hypertrophy, with an increase in the size of existing muscle fibers. One signaling pathway involved in regulating skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy is the AKT/mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway activity increases in response to muscle activity during hypertrophy and decreases in activity during atrophy. Blocking this pathway genetically or with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks hypertrophy and genetic activation of the pathway induces hypertrophy. One agent that promotes muscle hypertrophy is the growth factor IGF-1. IGF-1 activates AKT, GSK-3beta and mTOR to promote hypertrophy. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway is not involved in hypertrophy and is down-regulated by agents such as IGF-1 that promote hypertrophy. Calcineurin may modulate other aspects of muscle function such as the development of slow muscle fibers through transcriptional regulation. These pathways lead to regulation of protein translation, with increased translation apparently acting as a key regulatory point in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Agents such as IGF-1 that stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy may provide treatments for muscle atrophy and wasting."
BIOCARTA_IGF1R_PATHWAY,Multiple antiapoptotic pathways from IGF-1R signaling lead to BAD phosphorylation,"IGF-1R, the type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor, mediates cell survival and growth in response to its ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. This tyrosine kinase receptor is widely expressed in many cell types and is a key mediator of growth. Overexpression or activation of IGF-1R may be involved in the proliferation of transformed cells, making inhibition of IGF-1R signaling a strategy for the development of cancer drugs. IGF-1R activates three signaling pathways that converge to phosphorylate BAD protein and block apoptosis. The first pathway activated by IGF-1R stimulates PI3-kinase and the AKT pathway to phosphorylate BAD and block apoptosis. A second pathway activated by IGF-1R involves ras mediated activation of the map kinase pathway to block apoptosis. A third pathway involves interaction of raf with mitochondria in response to IGF-1R activation. The convergence of these pathways to block apoptosis may enhance the IGF-1R response."
BIOCARTA_IL10_PATHWAY,IL-10 Anti-inflammatory Signaling Pathway,"IL-10 is a cytokine with potent anti-inflammatory properties, repressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 by activated macrophages. The IL-10 receptor is in the JAK/STAT class of receptors but activation of the JAK/STAT pathways by IL-10 does not appear on its own to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of this cytokine. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 appear to require induction of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through a map kinase pathway involving the p38 kinases. HO-1 is involved in the biosynthesis of heme, and catalyzes a reaction producing carbon monoxide, free iron, and the heme precursor biliverdin. HO-1 is induced by IL-10 and is also induced by oxidative stress. Blocking HO-1 with inhibitors or antisense blocks the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10. The anti-inflammatory actions of HO-1 appear to be the result of signaling by carbon monoxide it produces since removal of CO blocks the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 and HO-1. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 may be therapeutically useful either directly or through modulation of HO-1 activity."
BIOCARTA_IL12_PATHWAY,IL12 and Stat4 Dependent Signaling Pathway in Th1 Development,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates a map kinase pathway activating the map kinase kinase MKK6 and p38. Phosphorylation of STAT-4 on serine 721 by p38 contributes to the full transcriptional activation of genes by STAT-4. Some of the events downstream of IL-12 appear to include genes activated indirectly by STAT-4, such as genes activated by the transcription factor ERM. ERM is in the Ets family of transcription factors, is activated by IL-12 and activates IL-12 inducible genes such as Interferon-gamma that are not activated by STAT-4 itself. Interferon-gamma transcription in T cells is also activated by other signals such as from the T cell receptor. Other proteins activated transcriptionally downstream of IL-12 and STAT-4 include the chemokine receptor CCR5 and IL-18 and its receptor. Some viruses, including HIV, repress cell-mediated immunity by blocking IL-12 signaling."
BIOCARTA_IL17_PATHWAY,IL 17 Signaling Pathway,"Inflammation is a complex response involving many different cells and signaling molecules, including the secretion of the cytokine IL-17 by activated T cells. IL-17 secretion is restricted to specific subsets of T cells but the receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed throughout the body, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders. Fibroblasts and other cells stimulated by IL-17 are induced themselves to secrete inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). These cytokines in turn provoke a range of activities, including the stimulation of neutrophil proliferation and differentiation."
BIOCARTA_IL1R_PATHWAY,Signal transduction through IL1R,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals primarily through the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). The activities of IL-1 include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and roles in arthritis and septic shock. The inflammatory activities of IL-1 are partially derived by transcriptionally inducing expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interferons, as well as inducing the expression of other inflammation-related genes. There are two forms of IL-1 encoded by distinct genes, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta is produced as a 269 amino acid precursor that is cleaved by IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) to the active IL-1 beta form that is secreted. IL-1 signaling is opposed by the naturally occurring peptide IL-1 receptor antagonist which is a therapeutic agent for the treatment of arthritis. The type 1 IL-1 receptor protein binds IL-1 beta but requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to transduce a signal. IL-1 binding causes activation of two kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-2, associated with the IL-1 receptor complex. IRAK-1 (IL-1 Receptor Associated Kinase) activates and recruits TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor complex. TRAF6 activates two pathways, one leading to NF-kB activation and another leading to c-jun activation. The TRAF associated protein ECSIT leads to c-Jun activation through the Map kinase/JNK signaling system. TRAF6 also signals through the TAB1/TAK1 kinases to trigger the degradation of I-kB, and activation of NF-kB. The IL-1 signaling cascade represents a highly conserved response to pathogens through evolution, with homologs in insects and even in plants. The signal transduction cascade utilized by IL-1 receptor is similar to that of TNF, resulting in NF-kB activation, and is most similar to that of the Toll-like receptors that also participate in inflammatory signaling responses to pathogen components like endotoxin."
BIOCARTA_IL22BP_PATHWAY,IL22 Soluble Receptor Signaling Pathway,"IL-22 is an inflammatory cytokine related to IL-10 that is produced by T cells and that induces a response in cells through a heterodimeric cell surface receptor composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2C. One of the actions of IL-22 appears to be the induction of the acute phase inflammatory response in hetapocytes, acting through activation of STATs and transcriptional regulation. A gene with homology to the extracellular domain of the cell surface IL-22R1 receptor component was identified that lacked transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The protein derived from this gene was found to bind IL-22 and block its interaction with the cell surface receptor. The IL-22 soluble receptor (IL-22BP, IL-22 binding protein) also blocks some of the downstream effects of IL-22 such as STAT activation and the transcriptional induction of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. The IL-22 soluble receptor may act as an anti-inflammatory agent."
BIOCARTA_IL2_PATHWAY,IL 2 signaling pathway,"Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine that can lead to cellular activation and proliferation. IL-2 Receptors are found on activated B-Cells, LPS treated Monocytes, and many T cells. The receptor is formed from three chains alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and gamma (CD132). Primary signaling is through the JAK/Stat pathway and MAPKs."
BIOCARTA_IL2RB_PATHWAY,IL-2 Receptor Beta Chain in T cell Activation,"The IL-2 receptor is a key component of immune signaling and is required for the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. This receptor is composed of three polypeptide chains, the alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2 receptor gamma chain is a common component for several other cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. The IL-2 receptor beta chain is essential for IL-2 signaling and is also a component of the IL-15 receptor complex. The polypeptides of the IL-2 receptor do not themselves have intrinsic catalytic activity, but interact with cytoplasmic signaling proteins to transduce signals. br>Different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor beta chain interact and couple with distinct signaling pathways and cellular responses. JAK1 associates with the beta chain, and JAK3 with the gamma chain. Binding of IL-2 induces heterodimerization of receptor subunits, and activation of JAK kinase activity. Tyrosine residues in the beta chain cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated during activation, recruiting other factors to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues through src homology 2 (SH2) domains. The adaptor protein Shc binds to phosphorylated tyrosine 338 of the beta chain. When bound, Shc is phosphorylated and couples through Grb2 and Sos-1 to activate Ras and stimulate T cell proliferation. Another key proliferative pathway activated by IL-2 is phosphorylation of STAT-5 by JAK kinases. STAT-5 is recruited to IL-2 beta phosphorylated tyrosines at multiple positions, including Y338, Y392 and Y510. Once phosphorylated, STAT-5 enters the nucleus to regulate the transcription of several genes, some proliferative such as cyclin genes and others that are involved in T cell immune function such as cytokine genes. The suppressors of cytokine activation, SOCS-3 and SOCS-1, oppose phosphorylation and activation of STAT-5 and JAK1 caused by IL-2. PI3 kinase is another protein recruited to IL-2 receptor beta chain tyrosines when phosphorylated. Activation of PI3 Kinase also contributes to the proliferative activity of IL-2 in T cells. The role of other tyrosines in the IL-2 receptor beta chain, Y355, Y358 and Y361, is not yet clear, but may be involved in signaling by the protein kinase p56lck. In addition to stimulating T cell activation and proliferation, IL-2 activation blocks T cell apoptosis through multiple pathways. Among the genes activated by STAT-5 are BCL-xL, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and fas-ligand, an activator of apoptosis in cells expressed the fas receptor. PI3 kinase also contributes to anti-apoptotic activity of IL-2 through AKT activation. T cell responses to IL-2 must be coordinated in part in the complex protein-protein interactions with the IL-2 receptor beta chain."
BIOCARTA_IL3_PATHWAY,IL 3 signaling pathway,"Interleukin-3 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells through binding to its receptor. The receptor for IL-3 is a heterodimer with a ligand-specific alpha chain (70 kD, CD123) and a common beta chain (shared with IL-5 and GM-CSF). Signaling is believed to be primarily through Stat5 and the MAPK pathways."
BIOCARTA_IL4_PATHWAY,IL 4 signaling pathway,"Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that can lead to development of Th2 cells. The 140 kD IL-4 Receptor (CD124) is found on many cell types, even those of non-hematopoietic origen. The receptor is formed from two chains: IL-4R(alpha) and the IL-2R gamma chain (CD132). Primary signaling is through the JAK/Stat6 pathway and MAPKs."
BIOCARTA_IL5_PATHWAY,IL 5 Signaling Pathway,"IL-5 is an inflammatory signaling molecule that primarily stimulates eosinophil proliferation, maturation and activation. Eosinophils are leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses that defend against parasites and cause some aspects of asthma, allergic reactions, and perhaps autoimmune disorders. The action of IL-5 begins with an immune response in tissues, such as activation of macrophages and T cells that secrete IL-1, IL-4 and IL-6. The immune response can lead to IL-5 secretion by T cells, eosinophils and mast cells. Secreted IL-5 stimulates production and maturation of eosinophils in bone marrow that migrate to tissues in response to eotaxin and release factors that damage tissues, causing some of the undesirable consequences of inflammation. The receptor for IL-5 is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit that is required for IL-5 selective binding and a beta subunit that is also part of the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors. Binding of IL-5 to the IL-5 receptor at the cell surface activates JAK/STAT signaling pathways that regulate transcription, proliferation, and differentiation."
BIOCARTA_IL6_PATHWAY,IL 6 signaling pathway,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a broad range of cellular and physiological responses. In addition to playing a role in inflammation and hematopoiesis, IL-6 is involved in other processes such as neuronal differentiation and bone loss. To produce these effects IL-6 signals through a receptor composed of two different subunits, an alpha subunit that produces ligand specificity and gp130, a receptor subunit shared in common with other cytokines in the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT3, that move into the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing STAT3 response elements. The ras-mediated pathway, acting through Shc, Grb-2 and Sos-1 upstream and activating Map kinases downstream, activates transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-IL-6 (C/EBP-beta) that can act through their own cognate response elements in the genome. These factors and other transcription factors like AP-1 and SRF (serum response factor) that respond to many different signaling pathways come together to regulate a variety of complex promoters and enhancers that respond to IL-6 and other signaling factors."
BIOCARTA_IL7_PATHWAY,IL-7 Signal Transduction,"IL-7 is a key cytokine in the immune system, essential for normal development of B cells and T cells. Mice with the IL-7 receptor deleted lack B and T cells. Some humans with SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency disease) also have mutation of their IL-7 receptor gene leading to an absence of T cells and greatly impaired B cell production. The IL-7 receptor includes two polypeptides, a gamma chain and an alpha chain. The alpha-chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor while several other cytokines use the same gamma receptor chain as IL-7, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. Binding of IL-7 to the alpha chain leads to dimerization of the alpha and gamma chains. JAK3 associated with the gamma chain tyrosine phosphorylates the alpha chain after dimerization. The importance of JAK3 in IL-7 signaling is supported by the similarity of the immune defects in JAK3 knockout mice and IL-7 knockout mice. The phosphorylated alpha chain serves as the site for recruiting other signaling molecules to the complex to be phosphorylated and activated, including STAT5, src kinases, PI3 kinase, Pyk2 and Bcl2 proteins. Some targets of IL-7 signaling contribute to cellular survival, including Bcl2 and Pyk2. Other targets contribute to cellular proliferation, including PI3 kinase, src family kinases (lck and fyn) and STAT5. The transcription factor STAT5 contributes to activation of multiple different downstream genes in B and T cells and may contribute to VDJ recombination through alteration of chromatin structure. The cell survival and cell proliferation signals induced by IL-7 combine to induce normal B and T cell development."
BIOCARTA_INFLAM_PATHWAY,Cytokines and Inflammatory Response,"Inflammation is a protective response to infection by the immune system that requires communication between different classes of immune cells to coordinate their actions. Acute inflammation is an important part of the immune response, but chronic inappropriate inflammation can lead to destruction of tissues in autoimmune disorders and perhaps neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disease. Secreted cytokine proteins provide signals between immune cells to coordinate the inflammatory response. Some cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF act to broadly provoke the inflammatory response while others act on specific types of immune cells. Macrophages and other phagocytotic cells provide a front-line defense against bacterial infection. Macrophages stimulate the inflammatory responses of neutrophils, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in response infection by secreting IL-1 and TNF. IL-1 and TNF cause fever through alteration of the body temperature set-point in the hypothalamus. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to IL-1 and TNF by recruiting more immune cells to the site of inflammation. Secreted IL-8 is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils to sites of infection. Macrophages also present antigen to T helper cells that play a central role in coordinating immune responses. T helper cells induce clonal expansion of T cells that respond to antigen, with IL-2 as a key mediator of T cell proliferation and activation. TGF-beta is a negative regulator of proliferation in many cells, have anti-inflammatory actions in some settings. The cytotoxic activity of Natural Killer cells (NK cells) and lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK cells) toward viral infected or tumor cells is stimulated by IL-2 and other cytokines. T helpers secrete IL-3 and IL-5 to stimulate eosinophil proliferation and activation. Eosinophils are involved in the immune response to parasitic infection. T helper cells are required to stimulate B cell responses as well, with the cytokines IL-10, IL-4 and other cytokines regulating the clonal selection and differentiation of antigen-specific B cells to form antibody-secreting plasma B cells and memory cells. In addition to inducing activation and proliferation of specific differentiated immune cells, cytokines act on hematopoeitic stem cells, causing their proliferation and differentiation into the full range of immune cells."
BIOCARTA_INSULIN_PATHWAY,Insulin Signaling Pathway,"The appropriate signaling through the insulin pathway is critical for the regulation of glucose levels and the avoidance of diabetes. Insulin forms a complex with the Insulin Receptor (IR) and b chains to form the active signaling complex. Through recruitment of adaptor molecules and the activation of RAS, the activated IR can cause transcriptional activation."
BIOCARTA_INTEGRIN_PATHWAY,Integrin Signaling Pathway,"Integrins are cell surface receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix and mediate intracellular signals in response to the extracellular matrix including cellular shape, mobility, and progression through the cell cycle. Integrins do not themselves possess a kinase domain or enzymatic activity but rely on association with other signaling molecules to transmit signals. Interactions between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton commonly take place at focal adhesions on the cell surface that contain localized concentrations of integrins, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal elements. Talin forms a direct interaction with the integrin cytoplasmic domain, and interacts with cytoskeletal elements (actin) and signaling factors. Paxillin and CAS also localize in focal adhesions and may serve as a scaffold for other integrin signaling components like FAK and src. Interaction of FAK, CAS and src may be required for integrin regulation of cell cycle progression. The CrkL adaptor protein may regulate downstream integrin signaling. Growth factor signaling pathways and the caveolin receptor exhibit important cross talk with integrin receptors in cellular responses like activation of map kinase, proliferation and motility."
BIOCARTA_INTRINSIC_PATHWAY,Intrinsic Prothrombin Activation Pathway,"Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The intrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to the blood or exposure of blood to collagen in a traumatized vessel wall. This usually also results in damage to fragile platelets. The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes 1 to 6 minutes. This cascade begins with the activation of factor XII and the release of platelet factor 3 (PF3) from damaged platelets. Activated factor XII cleaves and actives factor XI and prekallikrein (PK). Factor XII is also activated by activated prekallikrein (aPK) in an internal amplification loop. Calcium (Ca++) is required for the initial three steps. The prothrombin activator in the intrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the extrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also two of the steps in the formation of the activator. Protein C is activated by thrombin and with the Protein S cofactor provides a strong negative feedback in this phase of clot formation. When blood is collected, the intrinsic pathway is activated by contact with the collection devices causing damage to the platelets and activation of factor XII. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin. Use of nonwettable surface materials can increase the clot formation time to over an hour. Disease Significance: Most of the clotting factors are formed in the liver. Diseases of the liver or damage to the liver can depress the levels of these factors in the blood resulting in excessive bleeding. Vitamin K deficiency can also result in a similar condition since Vitamin K is essential for the formation of factor VII, IX, X and prothrombin. Vitamin K is synthesized in the intestinal tract by bacteria."

BIOCARTA_KERATINOCYTE_PATHWAY,Keratinocyte Differentiation,"The epidermis, which provides a protective barrier that undergoes a constant renewal, is a multi-layered tissue with the proliferating cells located in the basal layer. As cells leave the basal layer the underog significant differentiation, biochemical and morphological remodeling. The final differentiation results in the formation of corneocytes. In vitro keratinocytes mimic this process. Several genes mark keratinocyte specific differentiation. Among the most frequently tracked markers are Transglutaminase, Cystatin and Involucrin. The keratinocyte differentiation studies have identified and provided significant detail regarding the involvement of three of the 4 major MAP kinase pathways from several diverse stimuli such as EGF, FAS, TNF and Calicium influx. The p38 cascade is represented twice since both p38alpha (p38) and p38delta (MAPK13) are involved. The keratinocyte differentiation cascased also provide for detailed study of the functions of individual PKC isoforms. It is interesting to note the contrasting functions of the PKC isoforms in this process. In recent studies it has been determined that the cPKC (conventional/classical Protein Kinase C) isoforms, which are calcium-, phospholipid-, and diacylglycerol-dependent are inhibitory where as the nPKC (novel Protein Kinase C) isoforms which are calcium independent are stimulatory for keratinocyte differentiation markers. On the right hand side is an earlier step showing the upregulation loop of TRAF2. This step occurs prior to the activation os ASK1 and the p38 cascade."
BIOCARTA_KREB_PATHWAY,The Citric Acid Cycle,"The Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway involving eight enzymes essential for energy production through aerobic respiration, and, like glycolysis, arose early in evolution. This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase. Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolic junction, derived not only from glycolysis but also from the oxidation of fatty acids. As the cycle proceeds, the Krebs cycle intermediates are oxidized, transferring their energy to create reduced NADH and FADH2. The oxidation of the metabolic intermediates of the pathway also releases two carbon dioxide molecules for each acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle, leaving the net carbons the same with each turn of the cycle. This carbon dioxide, along with more released by pyruvate dehydrogenase, is the source of CO2 released into the atmosphere when you breathe. The Krebs cycle, like other metabolic pathways, is tightly regulated to efficiently meet the needs of the cell and the organis. The irreversible synthesis of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase is one important regulatory step, and is inhibited by high concentrations of ATP that indicate abundant energy. Citrate synthase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase are all key regulatory steps in the cycle and are each inhibited by abundant energy in the cell, indicated through high concentrations of ATP or NADH. The activity of the Krebs cycle is closely linked to the availability of oxygen, although none of the steps in the pathway directly use oxygen. Oxygen is required for the electron transport chain to function, which recycles NADH back to NAD+ and FADH2 back to FADH, providing NAD+ and ADH required by enzymes in the Krebs cycle. If the oxygen supply to a muscle cell or a yeast cell is low, NAD+ and FADH levels fall, the Krebs cycle cannot proceed forward, and the cell must resort to fermentation to continue making ATP. Some Krebs cycle enzymes require non-protein cofactors for activity, such as thiamine, vitamin B1. Insufficient quantities of this vitamin in the diet leads to decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and a decrease in the ability of the Krebs cycle to meet metabolic demands, causing the disease beriberi. Although the elucidation of the Krebs cycle remains one of the landmarks of biochemistry, aspects of the Krebs cycle and its enzymes are still actively researched in the modern proteomic era."
BIOCARTA_LAIR_PATHWAY,Cells and Molecules involved in local acute inflammatory response,"Inflammation has several distinct components, including the localized response at the site of tissue injury or infection. Tissue injury stimulates the release of inflammatory signaling molecules such as bradykinin. Bacterial infection stimulates an immune response in several ways. Bacteria that are phagocytosed can activate macrophages, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. Bacteria can also activate the complement cascade through either the antibody-mediated pathway (classical pathway) or the alternative complement pathway. In extravascular tissues, cells that respond to infection or injury include macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages and other immune cells secrete chemokines that recruit leukocytes from the circulation to the site of inflammation. Mast cells release histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes that act as chemokines, increase vascular permeability, and act on the vascular endothelium to increase tissue recruitment of leukocytes. Chemokines can recruit leukocytes or lymphocytes out of the blood stream into tissues and make blood vessels more permeable. Leukocytes are activated by inflammatory signals to express adhesion molecules that cause them to interact with the vascular endothelium, penetrate the endothelial wall and migrate into the extracellular space of tissues. The combined response of immune cells and signaling molecules at the site of inflammation induces swelling, activation of immune cells, and clearance of potential infectious agents. Chronic inflammation can however also lead to tissue damage in conditions such as arthritis, in which anti-inflammatory drugs act on various steps in inflammation to prevent disease."
BIOCARTA_LDL_PATHWAY,Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) pathway during atherogenesis, 
BIOCARTA_LECTIN_PATHWAY,Lectin Induced Complement Pathway,"The complement cascade of proteolytic factors involved in cellular lysis can be initiated by several different factors, including antibody-dependent and antibody-independent recognition of infectious organisms. In the lectin-induced complement cascade, carbohydrates on the surface of microbial cells activate the complement cascade by binding to mannan-binding lectin (also called the mannan-binding protein, Mbl/Mbp). Mbp is an acute phase serum protein whose expression is induced by microbial infection. The binding of Mbl to microbial ligands activates the Mbl associated serine proteases Masp1 and Masp2, triggering the cleavage of C2 and C4 to create C4bC2a, a C3 convertase that cleaves large numbers of C3. Masp1 and Masp2 are similar to the C1 protease in the classical complement pathway. Once formed the C3 convertase cleaves and activates the remaining complement factors leading ultimately to formation of a pore in the bacterial membrane by the membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses the bacterial cell. The lectin-induced pathway also appears to play an important role of the activation of phagocytotic cells by infection. Although the initiating event activating the complement cascade is distinct in the lectin-induced pathway, from the C3 convertase onward the lectin induced complement pathway is the same as the classical complement pathway. Since antibodies are not required in the lectin-induced pathway, this aspect of the immune response is part of the innate immune response. The importance of this pathway to the immune response has been demonstrated by the identification of children and adults with little or no Mbl who lacked normal phagocytotic responses and are highly susceptible to infection."
BIOCARTA_LEPTIN_PATHWAY,Reversal of Insulin Resistance by Leptin,"The insulin resistance of type II diabetes appears to be caused in part by the presence of high levels of lipids in cells such as skeletal muscle where this would not normally be found. The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import of fatty acids into mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I for oxidation and energy production. In the presence of leptin, AMPK is activated, ACC is inhibited, and malonyl-CoA levels fall, increasing the oxidation of fatty acids and reducing the lipid content of cells. The reduced lipid content in skeletal muscle allows insulin signaling and glucose consumption to return to their normal levels, reducing insulin resistance."

BIOCARTA_LONGEVITY_PATHWAY,The IGF-1 Receptor and Longevity,"A demonstrated means to increase lifespan in a wide range of organisms is through the restriction of caloric intake. Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric restriction. Although dwarf mice with defective growth hormone or IGF-1 signaling also have significantly increased lifespan, humans with defects in growth hormone signaling tend to develop diseases that shorten their lifespan. One of the downstream targets of IGF-1 signaling is to repress stress resistance proteins including antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, and heat shock proteins, so a reduction in IGF signaling may extend lifespan by increasing the expression of stress resistance genes. The link between caloric restriction and IGF signaling may be that a reduction in food intake reduces the expression of IGF-1, increasing the expression of stress resistance proteins. In addition to the IGF-1R mutation, p66 Shc mutation also increases lifespan without significant aberration of other systems. Shc is a target of IGF-1R phosphorylation, and a major inducer of cellular responses to oxidative stress. Shc increases levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, repressing the forkhead factor FKHRL1. Alhtough FKHRL1 is also involved in apoptosis, in the absence of Shc, FKHRL1 mediates increased resistance to oxidative stress. Exploration of the genes that induce longevity in animals models may enlighten the role of these genes in human disease and lifespan."
BIOCARTA_LYM_PATHWAY,Adhesion and Diapedesis of Lymphocytes,"Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. Generally, lymphocyte adhesion and passage from the bloodstream to the lymphatic system occurs in the high endothelial venules of the lymphnodes. This way the lymphocytes can communicate with each other in the lymphatic system and search for foreign compounds after their recirculation to the bloodstream, this fulfilling their role in the immune system. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flatteningof the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or even through the intercellular matrix. This is mediated by a homophilic interactions of PECAM and CD31."

BIOCARTA_MAL_PATHWAY,Role of MAL in Rho-Mediated Activation of SRF,"Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor, which binds to a serum response element (SRE) associated with a variety of genes including (i)immediate early genes such as c-fos, fosB, junB, egr-1 and -2, (ii)neuronal genes such as nurr1 and nur77, and (iii)muscle genes such as actins and myosins. By regulating expression of these genes, SRF controls cell growth and differentiation, neuronal transmission as well as muscle development and function. SRF can be activated by serum, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), agents that increase intracellular Ca2+, T-cell virus1 activator protein, hepatitis B virus activator proteins pX, activated oncogenes and protooncogenes and extracellular stimuli such as antioxidant and UV light. In serum-starved cells, MAL is predominantly cytoplasmic where it is sequestered by actin monomers. Upon serum stimulation, Rho becomes active and, through its interaction with ROCK and mDia1, causes an accumulation of F-actin and a commensurate decrease in the level of G-actin. As a consequence, MAL is no longer sequestered and is free to translocate to the nucleus where it associates with SRF and activates SRE-mediated gene expression."

BIOCARTA_MAPK_PATHWAY,MAPKinase Signaling Pathway,"The ever evolving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways consist of four major groupings and numerous related proteins which constitute interrelated signal transduction cascades activated by stimuli such as growth factors, stress, cytokines and inflammation. The four major groupings are the Erk (red), JNK or SAPK (blue), p38 (green) and the Big MAPK or ERK5 (light blue) cascades. Signals from cell surface receptors such as GPCRs and growth factor receptors are transduced, directly or via small G proteins such as ras and rac, to multiple tiers of protein kinases that amplify these signals and/or regulate each other. The diagram is organized to illustrate the cascades by the background colors and also the tiers of kinases as indicated down the left hand side and separated by the horizontal dashed lines. In some cascades the first activation tier involves the MAPKKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases or MAP4K proteins. The next tier are the serine/threonine MAPKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase or MAP3Ks such as RAF, TAK, ASK, and MEKK1. This level has the greatest amount of cross-communication curently known. The serine/threonine/tyrosine MAPKKs, MAP Kinase kinases or MAP2Ks, such as the MKK and MEK kinases, are one step up from the MAP kinase cascade, phosphorylating and activating these kinases. The focal tier, the MAPKs or MAP kinases includes JNK1, p38, and ERKs, and are the kinases that give each cascade its name BR>The endpoints of these cascades, shown in the bottom tier, includes the MAPK activated protein kinases (MAPKAPK) and some of the numerous transcription factors that regulate genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, cell growth and differentiation NOTES:- The shared color and the bold arrows show the major flow of each cascade. - The smaller arrows indicate cross communication between cascades. In many cases this is restricted to certain cell types or requires additional factors. - Kinases that have been identified as MAP kinases based on sequence or structural homolgies but have not yet been assigned to a cascade have been placed out side the grouping backrgounds. - The PAKs (p21 associated kinases) are not MAPKs but participate in the transduction to the JNK cascade are included for this reason.) - MEK4 appears to function in both the JNK and p38 cascades and so has a mixed color. MEK4 signal is much stronger in the JNK than the p38 cascade and so the bold arrow towards the JNK and the dashed arrow towards the p38 cascade indicate the relative strengths of signaling. - For space and readability concerns not all interactions and stimuli are indicated and the scaffold and phosphatase proteins are not shown."
BIOCARTA_MCALPAIN_PATHWAY,mCalpain and friends in Cell motility,"The mammalian calpain gene family currently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. ( An excellent introduction to the calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http://ag.arizona.edu/calpains/index.html ) One of the most carefully studied functions of the calpains is the regulation of integrin-mediated cell migration. Calpains digests the links between the actin cytoskeleton and several focal adhesion complex proteins; talin, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. The release from the focal adhesion complex facilitates migration. Calpestatin is an inhibitor expressed in most cells. Calpestatin binds the four inhibitory domains of calpain. Release from calpestatin does not activate calpain. Activation requires additional signaling, coactivators and an appropriate calcium concentration. During cell migration calpain1 (mu-calpain) acts at the leading edge as a response to integrin signals or calcium fluxuations due to the stretch activated calcium channels. Calpain1 cleaves the target proteins, talin, exzrin, paxillin and the cytoplasmic tail of the integrins B1(a) and B3(b) to release the adhesion and form new adhesions. Calpain2 (M-calpain) is believed to be membrane bound and functions at the trailing edge of the migrating cell to cleave the integrins in response to growth factor receptor signals. PKA functions to down regulate or inhibit calpain2. Disease related notes: In Alzheimers disease, amyloid peptides interfere with calpain activity causing a mislocalization of cdk5. Deregulated cdk5 hyperphosphorylates tau promoting cell death in neurons. Mutations in the muscle specific calpain p94 lead to Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A). Over activity of calpains due to elevated calcium leads to tissue damage in the heart and brain"
BIOCARTA_MCM_PATHWAY,CDK Regulation of DNA Replication,"Initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is a highly conserved, multi-step process (replication licensing) designed to restrict initiation events to once per replication origin per S phase. Its control has been uncovered by the discovery of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) as master regulators of the cell cycle and the initiator proteins of DNA replication, such as the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6/18, Cdt1 and the mini-chromosome maintenance complex (Mcm). The proteins and the sequence of events involved in this process are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. First, the ORC comprised of six proteins binds to replication origins in the chromosomal DNA. At the end of mitosis, ORC, Cdc6/18 and Cdt1 assist the binding of Mcm proteins 27 to chromatin, and chromatin becomes licensed for replication. The activated Mcm complex functions as a replicating helicase and moves along with the replication fork to bring the origins to the unlicensed state. The cycling of CDK activity in the cell cycle regulates the two states of replication origins, the licensed state in G1-phase and the unlicensed state for the rest of the cell cycle. The restriction on licensing is relieved when CDK falls off at the completion of mitosis to allow a new round of replication."

BIOCARTA_MET_PATHWAY,Signaling of Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor,"The hepatocyte growth factor receptor, also called c-Met, is activated by HGF and stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes and other cell types. Mutated forms of the HGF receptor are associated with oncogenesis and metastasis, making the HGF receptor a potential therapeutic target for cancer drugs. Changes in cell motility, cell shape, adhesion, resistance to apoptosis, and anchorage independent growth all contribute to the role of c-Met in cancer. The HGF receptor is a heterodimer with tyrosine kinase activity and associates with a multiprotein complex involved in downstream signal transduction. The HGF receptor can associate with several different signaling systems, including src, Grb2/SOS, PI3 kinase and Gab1. One of the major substrates of the activated HGF receptor tyrosine kinase is the adaptor protein Gab1. Gab1 interacts with Crk and CrkL, two proteins with SH2 and SH3 protein interaction domains that couple to signaling further downstream. The actions of HGF on paxillin, DOCK180 and Rap1 mediated through GAB1 and other members of this complex alter cell motility. Regulation of Rho, Rac1 and CDC42 pathways in response to HGF all contribute to changes in cellular motility. Another target of the HGF receptor kinase is the focal adhesion kinase, FAK. The activation of FAK induces the formation of focal adhesions, a preliminary step to increased cell motility and tissue invasion by transformed cells, and paxillin phosphorylation may also alter cell adhesion of Met transformed cells. Src and p130cas are required for the role of FAK in HGF induced cellular transformation. HGF also blocks anoikis, the induction of apoptosis through suspension of cells, by acting on Erk and AKT kinases. This activity may contribute to anchorage independent growth of Met transformed cells. Signaling by integrins also plays a key role in the activation of tissue invasive growth by HGF. The alpha6beta4 integrin acts as a cofactor along with Meta to participate in cell growth and proliferation. In addition to altering cell adhesion, proliferation and cell motility, HGF alters cellular transcription through activation of STAT3. STAT3 activation by HGF is independent of PI3 kinase or map kinases and alters gene expression leading to changes in cellular shape. Although HGF is associated with cellular proliferation and survival, in rat liver epithelial cells HGF induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth."

BIOCARTA_MITOCHONDRIA_PATHWAY,Role of Mitochondria in Apoptotic Signaling,"Mitochondria participate in apoptotic signaling pathways through the release of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase pathway. Smac/DIABLO is released from mitochondria and inhibits IAP proteins that normally interact with caspase-9 to inhibit apoptosis. Apoptosis regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins occurs as family members form complexes that enter the mitochondrial membrane, regulating the release of cytochrome c and other proteins. TNF family receptor that cause apoptosis directly activate the caspase cascade, but can also activate Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, which activates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Bax, another Bcl-2 family member, is activated by this pathway to localize to the mitochondrial membrane and increase its permeability, releasing cytochre c and other mitochondrial proteins. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent pore formation, blocking apoptosis. AIF (Apoptosis inducing factor) is another mitochondrial factor that is released into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis. AIF-induced apoptosis is important during development but is not caspase dependent."

BIOCARTA_MONOCYTE_PATHWAY,Monocyte and its Surface Molecules,"Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin expressed on lymphocytes that plays a role in adhesion through interaction with its adhesion partner on endothelial cells, VCAM-1."
BIOCARTA_MPR_PATHWAY,How Progesterone Initiates the Oocyte Maturation,"Progesterone (Pg) binds to both intracellular iPR and plasma membrane- bound mPR. (Right Top) After binding to Pg, iPR is recruited to the membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase p60c- src, which induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in activation of p90Rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Myt1, which favors formation of the activated cell cycle complex cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 causes breakdown of the germinal vesicle and the initiation of oocyte maturation. (Left). In contrast, binding of Pg to mPR leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through activation of Gi or inhibition of Gs. This leads to a decrease in the cAMPdependent kinase PKA, which relieves inhibition of Cdc25C (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cyclin B-Cdc2) and also indirectly promotes the activation of MAPK signaling.

BIOCARTA_MTA3_PATHWAY,Downregulated of MTA-3 in ER-negative Breast Tumors,"Approximately 30% of breast carcinomas lack ER expression. Presumably, these breast cancers become estrogen independent through genetic alterations that bypass the requirement for ER-dependent stimulation of cell proliferation. As such estrogen receptor is a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelia and represents a crucial prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression through direct gene activation of a number of genes (cathepsin D, HSP27 (heat shock protein 27,000 kDa, aldolase A, dehydrogenase, alpha-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphat, Pdzk1, Greb ets) and also through the biological functions of target loci. The product of human MTA3 has been identified as an estrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2/NuRD transcriptional corepressor in breast epithelial cells and demonstrate that MTA3 constitutes a key component of an estrogen-dependent pathway regulating growth and differentiation. The absence of estrogen receptor or of MTA3 leads to aberrant expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Aberrant Snail expression results in loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, an event associated with changes in epithelial architecture and invasive growth. MTA3 is the mechanistic link between estrogen receptor status and invasive growth of breast cancers."
BIOCARTA_MTOR_PATHWAY,mTOR Signaling Pathway,"mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appears to play a central role in signaling caused by nutrients and mitogens such as growth factors to regulate translation. The drug rapamycin acts on mammalian cells through the mTOR protein kinase, also known as FRAP. When bound to the immunophilin binding protein FKBP12, rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity and has immunosuppressant activity. Rapamycin and the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 are being tested as anti-cancer agents, acting to block mitogenic signaling. Recently, mTOR was also found to act as an ATP sensor to regulate cell growth. Upstream activation of PI 3 kinase activity that leads to oncogenic transformation can be blocked by inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. Growth factor receptors first stimulate PI 3 kinase, and through inositol phosphates activate PDK-1 and AKT (protein kinase B). AKT phosphorylates mTOR. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP by mTOR and the phosphorylation downstream of RPS6 and EIF-4B stimulate translational initiation and contribute to cell growth."
BIOCARTA_MYOSIN_PATHWAY,PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of inhibitory phosphoprotein of myosin phosphatase,"The phosphorylation of myosin affects its role in smooth muscle contraction, platelet formation and possibly other processes. Phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) increases myosin activity and dephosphorylation by myosin phosphatase decreases myosin activity. CPI, a factor that binds to and inhibits myosin phosphatase, is a target of phosphorylation by PKC and PKN. The inhibitory activity of CPI is regulated by its own phosphorylation state; when CPI is phosphorylated, its inhibitory activity is increased. The activation of signal transduction cascades such as GPCR pathways can lead to activation of PKC, phosphorylation of CPI, inhibition of myosin phosphatase, increased myosin phosphorylation and increased smooth muscle contraction or platelet release. The action of histamine in vasoconstriction, for example, may be mediated by activation of PKC through the histamine receptor, resulting in phosphorylation of CPI-17, increased inhibition of myosin phosphatase, and increased smooth muscle contraction."
BIOCARTA_NDKDYNAMIN_PATHWAY,"Endocytotic role of NDK, Phosphins and Dynamin","Reliable neurotransmitter release requires the presence of sufficent numbers of synaptic vesicles. The process of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) is coordinated by a group of proteins called dephosphins. The current set of seven known dephosphins are nerve treminal proteins with little or no structural hoimology but satisfy two essential criteria: they are essential for SVE and they are rapidly and coordinately dephosphorlyated in response to a calcium influx through voltage-dependent calicium channels. The calicium signal is mediated by calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin. Each dephosphin plays an essential role in overlapping phases or segments of the cycle. The four phases of SVE are nucleation, invagination, fission and uncoating. In this diagram the internalization of the vesicle is the uncoating step. In order to illustrate the complexity of this process the initial display of the protein is labelled with a name and a number. This number is then used at the decloaking or uncoating step to show the release and seperation of the various factors. Each step in the process has a different set of complex components. The components are shown in highlighted boxes above. The nucleation phase initiates with the activation of CaM/Calcineurin and the subsequent dephosphorylation of AP180. AP180 and clathrin are then recruited to the membrane by AP2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (comma shaped molecule in the diagram). Nucleation is completed by the addition of epsin and eps15. Invagination proceeds with the formation of the amphiphysin1/2 heterodimer and its addition to the maturing vesicle surface complexes. The final components, dynamin and synaptojanin, are recruited to the budding vesicle by the amphiphysin1/2 heterodimer. Dynamin forms a complete ring around the vesicle neck and completes fission via its PtdIns(4,5)P2 stimulated GTPase activity. After internalization the vesicle is quickly uncoated, in a process believed to be mediated by synaptojanin, and is accompnied by the disassembly of clathrin."

BIOCARTA_NFAT_PATHWAY,NFAT and Hypertrophy of the heart (Transcription in the broken heart),"Hypertrophy associated with both hypertension and obstruction to ventricular outflow leads to pathologic cardiac growth and it is associated with increase morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic ventricular disease takes a growing toll on the health of nations. As other cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infraction are in decline as causes of mortality, the heart failure problem becomes increasingly urgent. Congenital heart defects occur in 1% of live births and fetal heart malformations are implicated in many pregnancies that end in still-birth or spontaneous abortion. The current paradigm suggests that the heart adapts to excess of hemodynamic loading by compensatory hypertrophy, which under condition of persistent stress, over time evolves into dysfunction and myocardial failure. There is considerable evidence that direct effects of increased mechanical stress are sensed within the ventricular wall and that signals critical for the generation of growth responses. Despite compelling statistics we still do not understand biochemically why heart defects are so prevalent. A single transcriptional regulator initially associated with the activation of the T-cells"
BIOCARTA_NFKB_PATHWAY,NF-kB Signaling Pathway,"Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex consisting of at least three proteins; IKK1/IKKa, IKK2/IKKb, and IKK3/IKKg. These enzymes phosphorylate IkB leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which is the best-studied activator binds to its receptor and recruits a protein called TNF receptor death domain (TRADD). TRADD binds to the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) that recruits NF-kB-inducible kinase (NIK). Both IKK1 and IKK2 have canonical sequences that can be phosphorylated by the MAP kinase NIK/MEKK1 and both kinases can independently phosphorylate IkBa or IkBb. TRAF-2 also interacts with A20, a zinc finger protein whose expression is induced by agents that activate NF-kB. A20 functions to block TRAF2-mediated NF-kB activation. A20 also inhibits TNF and IL-1 induced activation of NF-kB suggesting that it may act as a general inhibitor of NF-kB activation."
BIOCARTA_NGF_PATHWAY,Nerve growth factor pathway (NGF),"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is one of a family of neurotrophins that induce the survival and proliferation of neurons. In cell culture NGF induces the formation of neurite projections and in vivo may stimulate the innervation of tissues. NGF plays a role in the repair, regeneration, and protection of neurons, and as such could serve as a therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. One potential method of NGF application would be through gene therapy or through implantation of cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo. NGF has also been suggested to play a role in other physiological systems and tissues such as the immune system. NGF has two receptors, TrkA and the p75(NTR). NGF may signal its neuroprotective actions through the tyrosine kinase TrkA receptor and trigger apoptosis in some cells through the p75 receptor. High-affinity binding of NGF requires both TrkA and p75(NTR). Binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor causes activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream signaling cascades. One of the downstream signaling pathways of NGF activates phospholipase C, releasing DAG and IP3 and activating associated downstream pathways such as protein kinase C. Another NGF-activated pathway is the ras-mediated activation of the map kinase pathway. This pathway is initiated through recruitment and activation of Shc, which leads to ras activation through Grb-2 and Sos-1. The Map kinase cascade includes raf, Mek and Erk. The downstream effectors of the ras pathway include activation of fos and jun to form AP-1, activating genes through this transcription factor. Other transcription factors involved in NGF responses include Egr and CREB. The Egr family of transcription factors as well as the Mek/Erk pathway contribute to NGF-induced neurite formation. The CREB family of transcription factors are involved in NGF-induced survival of sympathetic neurons. Further understanding of NGF signaling may be applied to the modulation of NGF responses in neurodegenerative conditions."
BIOCARTA_NKCELLS_PATHWAY,Ras-Independent pathway in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity,"NK (natural killer) cells are lymphocytes distinct from B and T cells that induce perforin-mediated lysis of tumor cells and virus-infected cells. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is activated by glycoproteins on the cell surface (activating receptors) and inhibited by MHC-1 with self-peptide bound. The MHC-1 inhibitory signal through Ig-family or lectin receptors prevents NK cells from killing normal cells. Abnormal MHC-1 expression in infected or tumor cells results in the release of perforin, the lysis of the abnormal cell and the release of cytokines that stimulate the immune response. MAP kinase inhibitors but not ras inhibitors are able to block NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating that the pathway can function by a ras-independent manner that involves the MAP kinase pathway. This pathway includes phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) as a key component, followed by Rac1 and the exchange factor Vav. The tyrosine kinase SYK and LAT may provide an additional pathway for activation of MAP kinases leading to NK cell activation, and also Pyk-2 activation by integrins. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 appears to mediate the cytotoxicity inhibitory signal that blocks lysis of normal cells. The balance of these positive and negative signaling pathways regulates the role of NK cells in the immune response."
BIOCARTA_NKT_PATHWAY,Selective expression of chemokine receptors during T-cell polarization,"Chemokine receptors expressed by T helper cells help recruit cells to specific locations based on their chemoattractant ligands. The polarization of T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells is associated with their expression of different subsets of chemokine receptors. Naive CD4 positive cells that have not been exposed to antigen express CXCR4 and CCR7. The most abundant chemokine receptors on Th1 cells involved in the cellular immune response to microbial agents include CXCR3, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, while Th2 cells express CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5. An additional class of T cells termed semi-nave cells may be induced by TGF-beta to express yet another class of chemokine receptors, CCR4 and CCR7. Although the expression of chemokine receptors in different cells is preferred in these cases, it is not absolute or exclusive, and there is overlap in expression between Th1 and Th2 cells. Although CCR7 positive cells have been reported to lack effector action, not be polarized, and to home only to lymphoid tissues, other studies have found CCR7 positive Th1 and Th2 cells and have identified CCR7 positive cells in non-lymphoid tissues. CCR4 appears associated with homing of lymphocytes to the skin, and CCR9 is associated with homing to the small intestine, while other chemokines like CXCR3 and CCR5 are associated with homing toward inflamed tissues more broadly. The expression of different chemokine receptors by subsets of T helper cells plays an important role in the migration and homing of these cells in tissues, and targeting of the immune response to specific cells."
BIOCARTA_NO1_PATHWAY,Actions of Nitric Oxide in the Heart,"Nitric oxide (NO) has a number of important physiological actions in the cardiovascular system. In the heart, NO plays role in keeping the vessels patent via vasodilation and prevention of platelet aggregation. It also plays an important role in regulating the force and rate of contraction. In vivo NO is released by shear stress of ligands that increase intracellular Ca2+ in endothelial cells. The increase intracellular Ca2+ activates nitric oxide synthase III (NOSIII) by promoting the binding of Ca/Calmodulin to the enzyme. NOSIII, which is resident in the Golgi complex, is transported together with caveolin-1 to the caveolae at the plasma membrane via vesicles. Shear stress signals via a potassium channel and the cytoskeleton, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequently in activation of Akt kinase. Akt activation by shear stress but also by VEGF activates NOSIII by serine phosphorylation, which increases the affinity of NOSIII for calmodulin. After agonist binding at the plasma membrane, NOSIII-activating receptors translocate to caveolae. VEGF receptor signals via its tyrosine kinase domain. Furthermore, agonist receptors activate calcium channels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via phospholipase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This calcium flux induces binding of calmodulin to NOSIII, whereas the NOSIII-caveolin-1 interaction is disrupted. At the same time, NOSIII is translocated into the cytosol. On binding of calmodulin, NOSIII generates NO, is enhanced by the interaction with Hsp90. Once activated, NOSIII catabolizes L-arginine to NO, which diffuses out of the cell. NO stimulates guanylate (G-) cyclase and increases cGMP levels. cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDEIII), and cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDEII). PKG may reduce the force and rate of contraction, possibly by phosphorylating troponin I or by phosphorylating phospholamban. PDEIII is inhibited by the increases in cGMP brought about by NO. This may result in an increase in cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA in turn activates Ca2+ channels, countering the effects of PKG. In contrast, cGMP may stimulate PDEII, reduce cAMP levels and PKA activity, and thereby reduce Ca2+ channel activity. Ach, acetylcholine. CAT-1, cationic amino acid transporter."
BIOCARTA_NO2IL12_PATHWAY,NO2-dependent IL 12 Pathway in NK cells,"Macrophages and NK cells help provide innate immunity against infection by intracellular parasites and communicate with each other to regulate this process. When stimulated, macrophages secrete the cytokine IL-12 that is essential for activation of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. IL-12 stimulates this NK cell response through activation of a JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Binding of IL-12 to its receptor on NK cells causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and another JAK kinase, Tyk2. Tyk2 in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT4, which can then translocate to the nucleus to activate genes, including the expression of interferon-gamma. IFN-gamma and IL-12 induce the differentiation of TH1 helper T cells that activate macrophages through interferon-gamma. A key modulator of NK cell activation by IL-12 is nitric oxide, NO, produced from arginine by the inducible nitric oxide synthase NOS2. Inactivation of the NOS2 gene in mice impairs the initial innate response to infection, including the activation of NK cells. This phenotype is similar to that of mice lacking interferon-gamma or IL-12 and a similar effect can be produced by inhibiting NOS2 with L-N6-iminoethyl-lysine (L-NIL) during infection, blocking the activation of NK cells by IL-12. NO production does not affect the activation of JAK2 by IL-12, but is required for Tyk2 activity, the downstream activation of STAT-4 and the production of interferon-gamma by NK cells. The role of NO in Tyk2 activation is not yet known, but does not seem to involve change the phosphorylation status of Tyk2. Curiously, activation of T cells by IL-12 does not appear to involved NO production, indicating a distinct mechanism is involved in NK cells. NO also plays a role as a feedback inhibitor of IL-12 production by macrophages, helping to prevent over-activation of the Th1 cells by IL-12. NO appears to make an important contribution to the early innate response to infections before specific immunity is active."
BIOCARTA_NOS1_PATHWAY,Nitric Oxide Signaling Pathway,"Glutamatergic-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production occurs via the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95)-neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) ternary complex. The increased intracellular Ca2+ stimulates the interaction of nNOS and calmodulin (CaM) and the translocaton of nNOS from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The dephosphorylation of nNOS by Calcineurin catalyzes the conversion of arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), which turns on guanylate cyclase and the various cGMP regulated signaling pathways."

BIOCARTA_NTHI_PATHWAY,NFkB activation by Nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae,"The role of Hemophilus influenzae in ear infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes the induction of an inflammatory response through activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. In addition to activation of inflammatory cytokine genes like IL-1 and TNF, H. influenzae activates TLR2 expression and genes involved in mucus production. Hemophilus influenzae activates NF-kB by multiple mechanisms, starting with activation of the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by the p16 protein in the H. influenzae outer membrane. TLR2 plays a key role in innate immune responses and is expressed in high levels in lymphoid cells as well as low levels in epithelial cells. The role of TLR2 was supported by blocking NF-kB activation with a dominant negative TLR2 and increasing it with transfection of a normal TLR2 gene. TLR2 in turn activates TAK1, which activates two divergent signaling pathways. One of these pathways leads to IkB kinase activation, IkB phosphorylation and degradation, releasing the NF-kB heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. In the alternate pathway, TAK1 also activates NF-kB through a Map kinase pathway, activating p38 and NF-kB in a nuclear translocation independent manner. Investigation of the mechanisms of H. influenzae signaling involved in NF-kB activation may provide the information needed to develop better treatments for inflammatory conditions caused by this pathogen. Other pathways modulate the role of NF-kB in H. influenzae pathogenesis. Glucocorticoids widely used as anti-inflammatory drugs increase TLR2 activation by H. influenzae through the NIK/I-kB kinase pathway, while they repress the p38 dependent activation of NF-kB. The repression of the p38 pathway by glucocorticoids occurs through activation of the MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) which dephosphorylates and deactivates p38. Another aspect of the inflammatory response to H. influenzae infection is the production of excessive mucus, contributing to the overall symptoms of infection. NF-kB activation of the Muc2 gene contributes to mucus overproduction, in addition to H. influenzae activation of the TGF-beta receptor, activating SMAD transcription factors SMAD3 and SMAD4. Understanding mechanisms that modify H. influenzae signaling will contribute to further understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of ear infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
BIOCARTA_NUCLEARRS_PATHWAY,Nuclear Receptors in Lipid Metabolism and Toxicity,"Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor/X receptor (SXR/PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and elimination. In addition to lipid metabolism, some members of the cytochrome P450 family genes are responsible for activation of procarcinogens, detoxification of environmental toxins and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. In particular, CAR, Nsil2 and recently identified VDR are important in up-regulation of these cytochromes. Of all the human cytochrome P450 genes, only a few CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 account for most toxicity effects, specifically CYP3A is responsible for clearing approximately half of the clinically prescribed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drug, is toxic in high doses due to the activation of CAR and the drugs subsequentconversion to acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A."
BIOCARTA_P27_PATHWAY,Regulation of p27 Phosphorylation during Cell Cycle Progression,"p27/Kip1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase cdk2/cyclin E and blocking cell cycle progression through the G1-S transition. Cancer cells in some cases have reduced levels of p27, supporting the importance of p27 in cell cycle regulation. The activity of p27 is regulated by phosphorylation, synthesis and degradation. Phosphorylation of p27 at threonine-187 by cdk2 causes p27 to associate with an SCF complex that targets p27 for proteolytic degradation. The F box protein Skp2 binds specifically to threonine-187 phosphorylated p27, recruiting it to the SCF complex for degradation. Other components of the p27 ubiquitin ligase complex include Skp1, Cul1, and Roc1/Rbx-1. Cks-1 has also been identified in a reconstituted system as an essential component for recruitment of p27 for degradation by the SCF complex. Signaling by cytokines may modulate cell survival, proliferation, or apoptosis through modulation of p27 expression. Cytokine and AKT signaling pathways activate forkhead transcription factors that induce p27 expression at the transcriptional level."
BIOCARTA_P35ALZHEIMERS_PATHWAY,Deregulation of CDK5 in Alzheimers Disease,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), a multi-functional kinase, and its neuron-specific activator p35 are required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Proteolytic cleavage of p35 produces p25, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conversion of p35 to p25 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5 and the hyperphosphorylates tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments and promotes apoptosis. In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress and calcium influx induce the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates, addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific inhibitors of calpain1, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In vitro, calpain1 directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative molecular mass 25,000. Application of the amyloid beta-peptide A beta induces the conversion of p35 to p25 in primary cortical neurons. Inhibition of cdk5 or calpain activity reduces cell death in A beta-treated cortical neurons. These observations indicate that cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. GSK3B also phosphoryklates tau but does not induce hyperphosphorylation in response to calpain activating stimuli. Additionally down-regulation or inhibition of PP2A increases the hyper-phosphorylation of tau."
BIOCARTA_P38MAPK_PATHWAY,p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway,"p38 MAPKs are members of the MAPK family that are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. Stress signals are delivered to this cascade by members of small GTPases of the Rho family (Rac, Rho, Cdc42). As with other MAPK cascades, the membrane-proximal component is a MAPKKK, typically a MEKK or a mixed lineage kinase (MLK). The MAPKKK phosphorylates and activated MKK3/5, the p38 MAPK kinase. MKK3/6 can also be activated directly by ASK1, which is stimulated by apoptotic stimuli. P38 MAK is involved in regulation of Hsp27 and MAPKAP-2 and several transcription factors including ATF2, STAT1, THE Max/Myc complex, MEF-2, ELK-1 and indirectly CREB via activation of MSK1."
BIOCARTA_P53_PATHWAY,p53 Signaling Pathway,p53 is a transcription factor who's activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The function is p53 is to keep the cell from progressing through the cell cycle if there is damage to DNA present. It may do this in multiple ways from holding the cell at a checkpoint until repairs can be made to causing the cell to enter apoptosis if the damage cannot be repaired. The critical role of p53 is evidenced by the fact that it is mutated in a very large fraction of tumors from nearly all sources.
BIOCARTA_P53HYPOXIA_PATHWAY,Hypoxia and p53 in the Cardiovascular system,"Hypoxic stress, like DNA damage, induces p53 protein accumulation and p53-dependent apoptosis in oncogenically transformed cells. Unlike DNA damage, hypoxia does not induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, suggesting that p53 activity is differentially regulated by these two stresses. Hypoxia induces p53 protein accumulation, but in contrast to DNA damage, hypoxia fails to induce endogenous downstream p53 effector mRNAs and proteins, such as p21, Bax, CIP1, WAF1 etc. Hypoxia does not inhibit the induction of p53 target genes by ionizing radiation, indicating that p53-dependent transactivation requires a DNA damage-inducible signal that is lacking under hypoxic treatment alone. The phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. Mdm-2 targets the p53 tumor suppressor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome, but, in addition, the p53 transcription factor induces Mdm-2, thus, establishing a feedback loop. Hypoxia or DNA damage by abrogating binding of HIF-1 with VHL and p53 with Mdm-2, respectively, leads to stabilization and accumulation transcriptionally active HIF-1 and p53. At the molecular level, DNA damage induces the interaction of p53 with the transcriptional activator p300 as well as with the transcriptional corepressor mSin3A. In contrast, hypoxia primarily induces an interaction of p53 with mSin3A, but not with p300."
BIOCARTA_PAR1_PATHWAY,Thrombin signaling and protease-activated receptors,"Thrombin is an extracellular protease that is involved in the clotting of blood and inflammation through its action on platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature and that plays a role in thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4. PAR1 activation may be involved in the dilation of arteries during inflammation through the action of thrombin on endothelial cells and in platelet activation by thrombin during clotting. PAR1 and PAR2 activation cause bronchodilation in airway and may protect against asthma. PAR 4 activation by thrombin activates platelets during clotting and mice lacking PAR4 have impaired clotting and platelets that do not respond to thrombin signaling. The action of thrombin on PAR1 and PAR4 on platelets and endothelial cells may also contribute to vascular permeability and inflammation. Activated PARs appear to couple primarily through Gq-mediated stimulation of inositol phosphate metabolism and intracellular calcium levels to activate platelets. PAR1 and PAR4 also appear to couple to multiple G-proteins and transduce signals through more than one G-protein mediated pathway in some circumstances. Signaling by PAR1 and PAR4 through Galpha12 pathways couples to Rho signaling and changes in cytoskeletal structure and cell shape. Gi activation does not appear necessary for platelet activation by PAR1 or PAR4, and platelet activation by these receptors requires an ADP signal perhaps acting through the platelet-associated purinergic receptor P2Y12. Gi-coupled signaling may play a role in mitogenic PAR signaling in some settings through Map kinase activation. Activation of Rho by PAR1 can induce cellular transformation through a Galpha12 mediated mechanism and sustained rho-dependent phosphorylation of the myosin light chain by PAR1 contributes to cytoskeletal changes and activation of platelets. Since the activation of PARs by protease cleavage is irreversible the primary mechanism for down-regulation of the PAR signaling cascade appears to be internalization and degradation of PAR receptors."
BIOCARTA_PARKIN_PATHWAY,Role of Parkin in the Ubiquitin-Proteasomal Pathway,"The motor defects of Parkinson's disease are related to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in specific brain regions. Examination of these neurons in diseased tissue has revealed the presence of Lewy bodies, dense aggregates that include the protein alpha-synuclein. A genetic basis for most cases of Parkinson's disease has not yet been identified, but mutations in alpha-synuclein have been associated with at least one rare form of the disease, and mutations in another protein, the parkin gene, are associated with another inherited form of Parkinson's disease. Parkin is found in Lewy bodies along with alpha-synuclein and the parkin protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Parkin appears to work in conjuction with ubiquitin activating (Uba)1, an E1 protein and the ubiquitin-conjugating (Ubc) enzymes UbcH7 and 8. The E1 delivers ubiquitin to the E2 in a cycle that creates an increasing chain of ubiquitin. The Parkin E3 ligates this onto substrates and so tags these proteins in normal cells, targeting them for destruction in the proteosome. One of the proteins that parkin normally targets for destruction is a specific O-glycosylated form of alpha-synuclein. Failure of parkin-mediated degradation of alpha-synuclein may be a key factor leading to the death of dopaminergic neurons. Another substrate of parkin is a GPCR-like protein called Pael-R that accumulates in the ER of affected cells and may cause neuronal cell death. The involvement of Parkin and alpha-synuclein mutations in genetic forms of Parkinson's suggest that failure of ubiquitination and protein degradation may be causative in other forms of Parkinson's. Questions remaining include the cause of the lack of effective ubiquitination in individuals lacking obvious genetic defects in this pathway and how to use this knowledge of ubiquitination and protein degradation in Parkinson's disease to identify therapeutic strategies."

BIOCARTA_PDGF_PATHWAY,PDGF Signaling Pathway,"Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) plays a critical role in cellular proliferation and development. The biologically active form is a dimer formed from the A and B chains. PDGF is active to a differing degree depending on which dimer is formed (AA, AB, or BB). The PDGF Receptor (PDGFR) is also a dimer and can form from the combination of the alpha and beta chains in any order (alpha-alpha, alpha-beta, beta-beta). The PDGFR dimer is only formed after ligand binding so the alpha/beta composition of the receptor can be influenced by the form of PDGF that is present. Upon binding of ligand the PDGFR is tyrosine phosphorylated and leads to the phosphorylation of several other cellular proteins."

BIOCARTA_PGC1A_PATHWAY,Regulation of PGC-1a,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a) is a tissue-specific coactivator that enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors and coordinates transcriptional programs important for energy metabolism and energy homeostasis. Inappropriate increases in PGC-1a activity have been linked to a number of pathological conditions including heart failure and diabetes. PGC-1a is highly expressed in metabolically active tissues including brown fat, skeletal muscle and heart. PGC-1a has been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart and increased mitochondrial respiration in brown fat. PGC-1a is a coactivator for many factors including, CBP, Scr-1, PPARa, GR (glucocorticoid receptor), THR (thyroid hormone receptor), several orphan receptors and MEF2. This pathway illustrates two of the cofactor regulatory factors MEF2 and PPARa) and an example orphan receptor feedback inhibition loop. Glut4 is used as an example of the downstream elements leading to changes in metabolism. Ichida et al discovered the ERRa repression of PGC-1a. Their results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional control wherein ERR-a can function as a specific molecular repressor of PGC-1a. This suggests that other co-activators might also have specific repressors, adding another layer of combinatorial complexity in transcriptional regulation. Czubryt et al identified PGC-1 a as a key target of the MEF2/HDAC regulatory pathway and demonstrated this pathway's importance in maintenance of cardiac mitochondrial function. The linking of MEF2/HDAC provides an potential explanation for the increase in mitochondrial number observed in response to CaMK signaling."
BIOCARTA_PITX2_PATHWAY,Multi-step Regulation of Transcription by Pitx2,"Many transcription factors play essential roles in normal development by determining the proliferation and differentiation of cells. The coordinated transcriptional control of proliferation in specific developmental cell types is crucial in multiple developmental settings. One of a family of three bicoid-related transcription factors, Pitx2 acts downstream of the extracellular signaling protein Wnt to drive proliferation of cells with specific developmental fates, including cells in the pituitary, cardiac outflow region, and muscle. Wnt binds to Frizzled, a G-protein coupled receptor, activating homologs of the Drosophila Disheveled protein. Activation of Frizzled and Disheveled inhibits the kinase GSK-3 beta, part of a protein complex in the absence of Wnt signaling, causing beta-catenin protein to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Beta-catenin is known to alter the function of transcription factors like TCF/Lef. One result of Wnt signaling is activation of the transcription factor Lef by beta-catenin, inducing Pitx2 expression. Wnt activation also changes Pitx2 from a repressor to an activator by causing transcriptional corepressors like histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) bound to Pitx2 to be exchanged for coactivators. With coactivators bound, Pitx2 activates transcription of genes that regulate the cell cycle like Cyclin D2. Different coactivators are recruited by Pitx2 and other transcription factors like Myc to the Cyclin D2 promoter, with CBP/p300 recruited first, followed by NLI/Ldb/CLIM, Tip60/TRRAP, and PBP coactivators. Many of these coactivators help to alter histone acetylation and chromatin structure as part of transcriptional activation. The activation of cell cycle genes by Pitx2 ultimately stimulates the proliferation of specific cell types with the confluence of tissue-specific gene expression, growth factor signaling and coactivator recruitment."

BIOCARTA_PLATELETAPP_PATHWAY,Platelet Amyloid Precursor Protein Pathway,"The amyloid -beta peptide (Ab), a proteolytic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the major componenet of senile plaques, the hallmark of alzhemiers disease. Platelets contain both APP and Ab and probably contribute greater than 90% of circulating APP. The soluble APP is the major inhibitor of coagulation factors IXa and XIa, and platelet aggregation. Agonists such as ADP, thrombin, epinephrine and collagen activate the release of APP and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (an important regulator of coagulation) from platelet storage granules. These important molecules released from platelets are key regulators of hemostasis, the physiologic arrest of hemorrhage at site of vascular leakage."
BIOCARTA_PLC_PATHWAY,Phospholipase C Signaling Pathway, 
BIOCARTA_PLCD_PATHWAY,Phospholipase C d1 in phospholipid associated cell signaling, 
BIOCARTA_PLCE_PATHWAY,Phospholipase C-epsilon pathway,"Proposed model for b2-AR- and prostanoid-receptor-mediated PLC and calcium signalling. Receptors coupling to Gs stimulate AC, resulting in elevated cAMP levels and activation of Epac1. Epac1 then catalyses GTP-loading on Rap2B, which leads to PLC-e activation. The proposed pathway may involve additional signalling components to attain PLC stimulation. The action of cAMP seems to be independent of PKA; Instead, the cAMP-activated Rap-GEF Epac seems to serve as a cAMP effector, inducing GTP loading and, hence, activation of Rap2B, which then leads to specific activation of PLC-e, which has been shown to interact with Rap GTPases. It is an attractive hypothesis, therefore, that the Rap-dependent PLC and calcium signalling pathway reported here is not restricted to Gs-and AC-coupled receptors, such as the b2-AR and the prostanoid receptor, but could be used by other receptors as well."
BIOCARTA_PLK3_PATHWAY,Regulation of cell cycle progression by Plk3, 
BIOCARTA_PML_PATHWAY,Regulation of transcriptional activity by PML,"The PML nuclear bodies are ring-shaped nuclear substructures associated with the regulation of transcription, transformation, cell growth, and apoptosis and are characterized by the presence of the protein PML. The activities of PML as a tumor suppressor and apoptosis inducing factor are exerted through the numerous proteins it interacts with in the PML-nuclear bodies including the tumor suppressor p53. DNA damage induced activation of p53-dependent apoptosis requires PML. PML acts as a coactivator for p53 and increases acetylation of p53 by the transcriptional coactivator CBP. This acetylation of p53 is reversed by the deacetylase SirT1, the human homolog of the yeast gene Sir2, and this deacetylation opposes the transcriptional activation of p53. The tumor suppressor Rb also interacts with the PML nuclear body, increasing transcriptional repression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, suggesting that PML may affect cellular transformation through more than one mechanism. PML interacts directly with Ubc9, which modifies PML through the attachment of the ubiquitin-like peptide Sumo-1. Sumo-1 modification of PML is not necessary for the nuclear bodies to form, but may affect the recruitment of proteins that interact with PML. PML is involved in non-p53 mediated apoptotic pathways, such as DAXX-mediated apoptosis induced by Fas and TNF and regulates the transcriptional repressor activity of Daxx. The sequestration of Daxx by the PML nuclear bodies relieves the repression of other transcription factors like Pax3 by Daxx. Tumor suppression by PML may in general involve the formation of specific regulatory transcription complexes, including those with DAXX, p53 and CBP. Factors that affect the assembly of PML into the PML nuclear bodies affect the proliferation and transformation of cells. Viral early proteins can interact with PML to disrupt the nuclear bodies, allowing increased proliferation of cells and reduced apoptosis, good conditions for DNA virus infection. Another factor that disrupts the formation of PML nuclear bodies is a translocation between the PML and RAR-alpha genes found in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. Binding of retinoic acid to the RAR-alpha steroid hormone receptor activates transcription of retinoic-acid responsive genes. The translocation found in APL patients creates two chimeric proteins, RARalpha-PML and PML-RARalpha. Retinoic acid given to APL patients causes the reappearance of nuclear bodies, and the reversal of cellular transformation, effecting a cure for these patients."
BIOCARTA_PPARA_PATHWAY,Mechanism of Gene Regulation by Peroxisome Proliferators via PPARa(alpha),"The most recognized mechanism by which peroxisome proliferators regulated gene expresssion is through a PPAR/RXR heterodimeric complex binding to a peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) (classical mechanism). However, there are the possibility of several variations on this theme: 1). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR that preexists as a DNA complex with associated corepressors proteins. The interaction with ligand causes release of the corepressor and association with a coactivator, resulting in the classical mechanism. 2). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR as a soluble member of the nucleus. The binding of ligand results in RXR heterodimerization, DNA binding and coactivator recruitment. 3). In this scenario, PPAR exists in the cytosol, perhaps complexed to heat shock protein 90 and/or other chaperones. Binding of peroxisome proliferator causes a conformational change and translocation into the nucleus. Scenarios 4 and 5 require regulation of gene expression via non-classical mechanisms: 4). PPAR is capable of interacting with, and forming DNA binding heterodimers with, several nuclear receptors including the thyroid hormone receptor. The binding site for this non-RXR heterodimer need not be the classic DR-1 motif found in the PPRE. 5). PPAR may participate in the regulation of gene expression witout binding to DNA. By association with transcription factors such as c-jun or p65, PPAR diminishes the ability of AP1 or NFB to bind to their cognate DNA sequences, respectively. Also shown in this scheme are two means to modify the peroxisome proliferator response. Most importantly, growth factor signaling has a pronounced affect on PPAR via post-translational modification. PPAR is a phosphoprotein and its activity is affected by insulin. Several kinase pathways affects PPARa's activity, although the specific kinases and phosphorylation sites have not been conclusively determined."

BIOCARTA_PROTEASOME_PATHWAY,Proteasome Complex,"Attachment of the ubiquitin peptide to proteins targets them for proteolytic degradation by a complex cellular structure, the proteasome. The regulated proteolysis of proteins by proteasomes removes denatured, damaged or improperly translated proteins from cells and regulates the level of proteins like cyclins or some transcription factors. E1 and E2 enzymes prepare ubiquitin chains that are then attached to proteins by the E3 enzyme. The sequence of ubiquitin and the basic structure and function of the proteasome are highly conserved. The core proteasome in man (20S proteasome) consists of four rings each with 14 subunits stacked on top of each other that are responsible for the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. The PA700 regulatory complex is stacked on the ends of the cylindrical core to form a 26S proteasome. Proteins that are tagged with ubiquitin are recognized and bound by the regulatory subunits, then unfolded in an ATP-dependent manner, and inserted into the core particle, where proteases degrade the protein, releasing small peptides and releasing the ubiquitin intact. The PA28 regulatory complex is alternative regulatory complex that appears to play a role in antigen processing for presentation of peptides to immune cells in the MHC I complex."
BIOCARTA_PS1_PATHWAY,Presenilin action in Notch and Wnt signaling,"Presenilin-1 (PS1) is associated with gamma secretase activity that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin-1 is also a component in gamma-secretase activity involved in signaling by the transmembrane protein Notch. Active gamma secretase requires PS-1 N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment and is unique in catalyzing proteolysis within the transmembrane region of proteins. Other proteins such as nicastrin may also be components of the gamma-secretase. Binding of the ligand Delta by Notch appears to trigger two proteolytic cleavages of Notch. The first step cleaves an extracellular domain and is catalyzed by a metalloprotease termed alpha-secretase or TACE. The second cleavage step appears to occur within the transmembrane domain of Notch, and releases a Notch intracellular doman (NICD). Once released, NICD moves into the nucleus where it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CSL family transcription factors (CBF1, Su(H), Lag-1) or other transcriptional regulators such as LEF-1. Presenilin is also involved in the Wnt/frizzled signaling pathway through beta-catenin. Beta-catenin is a cytoskeletal component that enters the nucleus to act as a transcriptional cofactor. Binding of WNT to Frizzled causes disheveled (DSH) to inhibit Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3b) activity. Phosphorylation of Beta-catenin induces the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of beta-catenin by the proteasome. Non-phosphorylated beta-catenin is stable and enters the nucleus to regulate transcription with TCF. The beta-catenin/TCF complex activates genes that promote cellular survival, proliferation and differentiation during development. Presenilin stimulates beta-catenin turnover, reducing its transcriptional activation."
BIOCARTA_PTC1_PATHWAY,Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) Receptor Ptc1 Regulates cell cycle,"Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein identified genetically as an important developmental factor. Shh provides a morphogenic signal in the developing CNS, organizing the spatial patterning of cells in the midbrain and inducing proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum, neural tube and retina. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Sonic hedgehog signaling may proceed by more than one mechanism. One signaling pathway is activated by Shh binding to Patched (Ptc-1) which releases inhibition of the GPCR Smoothened, activating the Shh signaling pathway and allowing progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Shh can also affect progression through the G2/M transition. Patched binds to phosphorylated Cyclin B1, one component of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), along with the kinase Cdc2. The interaction of Cyclin B1 with Patched blocks MPF activity, blocking progression through the G2/M transition. Shh binding leads to degradation of Ptc-1, release of Cyclin B1, and entry of the cyclin B1 into the nucleus. Patched acts as a tumor suppressor by blocking MPF activity. Blockade of the Hedgehog pathway by cyclopamine demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Hedgehog inhibition in the treatment of some cancers."
BIOCARTA_PTDINS_PATHWAY,Phosphoinositides and their downstream targets.,"Nine currently identified phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-K) constitute a subfamily of lipid kinases that catalyze the addition of a phosphate molecule on the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), the precursor of all phosphoinosi-tides (PI), constitutes less than 10% of the total lipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. Approximately 5% of cellular PI is phosphorylated at the 4-position (PtdIns-4-P), and another 5% is phosphorylated at both the 4- and 5-positions (PtdIns-4,5-P2 ). However, less than 0.25% of the total inositol-containing lipids are phosphorylated at the 3-position, consistent with the idea that these lipids exert specific regulatory functions inside the cell, as opposed to a structural function. Here we have chosen to highlight a group of the phosphoinositide targets of the PI3-Ks and their downstream targets. The downstream effects of these PI-3 targets are indicated in the lower band illustrating the important role the PI3Ks have in cell function and survival."
BIOCARTA_PTEN_PATHWAY,PTEN dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,"PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene. Recombinant PTEN is capable of dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, the product of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. Many of the cancer-related mutations have been mapped to the phosphatase catalytic domain, it has been suggested that the phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for its tumor suppressor function. The activation of PKB/AKT is regulated in a complex manner via phosphorylation of AKT on Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and ILK(integrin-linked kinase) respectively. Inactivation of PTEN will constitutively activate PKB/AKT pathway. In addition to its role in regulating the PI 3-K/AKT cell survival pathway, PTEN also inhibits growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation and suppresses the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. PTEN also interact with FAK, a key molecule implicated in integrin signaling pathways, and it directly dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK. PTEN down-regulation of p130CAS through FAK results in inhibition of cell migration and spreading."
BIOCARTA_PYK2_PATHWAY,Links between Pyk2 and Map Kinases,"This diagram is a compilation of Pyk2 effort cascades. In specific cell types the receptor and effoectors will vary. Binding of a transmembrane receptor triggers the activation of Ca2+ signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1. In turn, Rac1 initiatates the JNK cascade, starting with PAK follwed by MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK. JNK activation causes induction of c-Jun gene binding. Pyk2 stimulation has also been shown to activate MKK3 leading to activation of p38. The other major mitogen activated kinase cascade for ERK1/2 is stimulated via RAS, RAF and MEKK1/2."
BIOCARTA_RAB_PATHWAY,Rab GTPases Mark Targets In The Endocytotic Machinery,"The eukaryotic cell contains compartments with distinct functions bounded by lipid bilayer membranes. The movement of membrane vesicles between these compartments allows proteins in the secretory pathway to move outward from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, trans Golgi network (TGN), secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane and to be secreted into the extracellular environment. The trafficking of membrane vesicles is also essential for endocytosis and the movement of material from the extracellular environment into the early endosome (EE), late endosome (LE) and lysosome. The movement of vesicles and their contents between these compartments and their secretion are essential for a host of cellular functions, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. The movement of membrane vesicles between all of these compartments is regulated by members of the Rab family of GTPases, part of the ras superfamily of genes, regulated through binding of GTP and hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. At least eleven yeast genes in this family have been identified as Ypts, yeast transport proteins, and over sixty mammalian Rab genes have been identified in this highly conserved gene family. The products of the Rab genes regulate specific steps in vesicle transport. Rab1 is involved in the movement of membranes from the ER through the Golgi. Rab3 regulates secretory vesicle release and Rab27 is also involved in regulated release of secreted proteins. Rab5, 7 and 9 contribute to endocytosis while Rab4 and Rab11 mediate recycling from the endosome back to the plasma membrane. Rab11 is involved in both endocytosis and exocytosis. As with other Ras family GTPases, the activity of Rabs is regulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GAPs (GTPase activating proteins). Downstream effectors must also interact with Rabs to transmit their signals regulating each step of the membrane trafficking pathways including vesicle formation, movement of vesicles between compartments, vesicle docking, fusion and membrane remodeling. Downstream effectors of the Rabs include Rabphilin-3 (vesicle movement effector for Rab3), Rabphilin-11 (vesicle formation effector for Rab11), and EEA1 (vesicle fusion and membrane remodeling). If Rabs are involved in more than one role and other components of Rab signaling also interact with more than one Rab this will further increase the complexity of the system. Elucidating the interaction of Rabs and regulation of vesicle trafficking by other signaling pathways will be a key area of research in the future."
BIOCARTA_RAC1_PATHWAY,Rac 1 cell motility signaling pathway,"Rac-1 is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell motility in response to extracellular signals. Several changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell motility. Rac-1 is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors, including Trio and Vav. Sos-1 is involved in Ras signaling and also acts as a GEF for Rac to transduce signals between Ras and Rac. SWAP-70 is a Rac GEF that binds IP3 and transduces signals from tyrosine kinases to Rac to modulate the cytoskeleton and cause membrane ruffling. GAPs are GTPase- activating proteins. Rac stimulates the formation of actin-based structures such as filopodia and lamellopodia, while GAPs such as chimerin oppose the formation of these Rac dependent structures. Several different factors downstream of Rac act on cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell motility. Pak1 provides a direct link from Rac to cell motility through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Pak1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin as one target. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses its activity. In neurons, Rac acts through the protein kinase cdk5 and p35 to phosphorylate and downregulate Pak1, increasing neuronal migration. Rac-1 also interacts with several other factors to regulate a variety of processes. Interaction of Por1 with Rac-1 is involved in membrane ruffling. WAVE is a member of the WASP family of proteins that regulate actin organization and that is involved in Rac signaling to cause membrane ruffling. Interaction of Rac-1 with MEKK1 integrates Rac signaling with pathways signaling through map kinases."

BIOCARTA_RACCYCD_PATHWAY,Influence of Ras and Rho proteins on G1 to S Transition,"The cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. This transition is regulated by the checkpoint kinase cdk2 that activates the G1 to S transition when it is associated with cyclin E. Cdk2/Cyclin E causes the G1 to S transition through phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor Rb, releasing the transcription factor E2F-1. Other pathways acting through Rac, Ras and Rho also regulate the G1 to S transition. Ras regulates cyclin D1 expression to affect the G1 to S transition. Transforming forms of Ras or Raf induce cyclin D1 expression and cause early entry into S phase. Signaling from Ras to Raf to MEK to ERKs induces Cyclin D1 expression, allowing Cyclin D1 to complex with Cdk4 and Cdk6 and phosphorylate Rb. Rac-1 and PAK appear to induce Cyclin D1 expression and induce the G1 to S transition primarily through activation of NF-kB to activate the Cyclin D1 promoter. Rho activates cdk2 and also inhibits p21 and p27 to induce cyclin D1 and stimulate the G1 to S transition. Rho represses p21 expression to block p21 induction by Ras and to allow Ras induced progression from G1 to S. Cells that lack p21 do not require Rho for Ras to induce cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The cooperative action of Ras, Rac and Rho to induce Cyclin D1 expression is a key component of oncogenic transformation."

BIOCARTA_RANBP2_PATHWAY,Sumoylation by RanBP2 Regulates Transcriptional Repression, 
BIOCARTA_RANKL_PATHWAY,Bone Remodelling,"Bone density and structure is maintained through a balance of bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone deposition by osteoblasts. The combination of simultaneous resorption and deposition creates continual remodeling of bone while excess osteoclast activity leads to an imbalance and a loss of bone density, causing osteoporosis. RANK (receptor activator of NF-kB ligand) is a receptor in the TNF receptor gene family that is involved in osteoclast differentiation. RANK-ligand, also called osteoprotegerin-ligand, binds to RANK, induces receptor dimerization, and activates downstream signaling. Osteoprotegerin is a decoy receptor for RANK-ligand that suppresses osteoclast activity and bone remodeling, helping to maintain balanced bone remodeling. RANK-ligand and osteoprotegerin are produced by osteoblasts and some factors regulate osteoclast activity indirectly through their action on the expression of these factors by osteoblasts. Binding of RANK-ligand to RANK activates signaling through TRAF-6. TRAF-6 induces several downstream signaling events, including activation of NF-kB, c-Fos and the kinase JNK1. Jnk-1 activation contribute to fos activation by RANK-ligand and may be involved in the modulation of RANK-ligand by other factors such as estrogen. Mice lacking the c-Fos gene have overly dense bone and decreased bone resorption due to reduced osteoclast differentiation, indicating that c-Fos is an important mediator of osteoclast differentiation. One of the results of c-Fos induction is transcriptional activation of interferon-beta. Interferon-beta binds to its receptor on neighboring osteoclast precursor cells to block RANK-ligand signaling and down-regulate c-Fos expression, inhibiting further osteoclast differentiation. Mice lacking interferon-beta or the interferon-beta receptor lose bone due to uncontrolled osteoclast activity, demonstrating the importance of this mechanism in vivo. Interferon-beta signaling could be used as a mechanism to prevent osteoporosis and other conditions involving excessive osteoclast resorption of bone."
BIOCARTA_RANMS_PATHWAY,Role of Ran in mitotic spindle regulation,"One of the central features of mitotic cell division is the formation of the spindle that segregates chromosomes into each daughter cell. Chromosomes are not just passengers along for a ride with the spindle, but active participants in the nucleation and stabilization of spindle microtubules in their near vicinity. The ras-like GTPase Ran that regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) during interphase also regulates the formation of the mitotic spindle. Ran plays a similar role in each of these processes, regulating downstream signaling pathways in a differential manner based on whether GDP or GTP is bound. Like other GTPases, the inherent GTPase activity of Ran is regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and by exchange factors. An exchange factor that stimulates nucleotide exchange by the Ran GTPase is RCC1, which binds to chromatin in both interphase and mitosis. While RCC1 helps RAN drive transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm during interphase, the localization of RCC1 on chromatin during mitosis localizes Ran-GTP near chromosomes, localizing microtubule formation in these regions. Ran-BP1 and Ran-GAP1 stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Ran, converting it back to Ran-GDP further away from chromosomes. Aster promoting activities (APA) and the importin-alpha and importin-beta proteins involved with Ran in nucleocytoplasmic transport are also involved in mitotic spindle formation. Aster promoting activities stabilize microtubules during spindle formation, but binding of importins to APA neutralizes their activity in forming microtubules. The importins bind to APA when far from the chromosomes, where Ran-GDP predominates, but Ran-GTP near chromosomes causes importins to release APA factors including Tpx2 and NuMa, allowing them to stimulate microtubule formation. Tpx2 interacts with the microtubule motor protein Xklp2 and also activates the Aurora A mitotic kinase, required for spindle formation. In addition to regulating spindle formation, Ran may also help reform the nuclear envelope after cell division and may use a similar mechanism to regulate other cellular processes."
BIOCARTA_RARRXR_PATHWAY,Nuclear receptors coordinate the activities of chromatin remodeling complexes and coactivators to facilitate initiation of transcription in carcinoma cells,RXR and RAR are nuclear receptors that bind either all trans retinoic (tRA) or 9cis retinoic acid (9cisRA). In the absence of ligand corepressors with histone deacetylase activity are bound to the RAR/RXR hetrodimer and suppress transcription. Once they bind retinoic acid a conformational change in the receptors cause the dissociation of the corepressors and the binding of coactivators with histone acetylase activity (1). Following ligand binding by the hetrodimer the receptors and proteins in the basal transcription machinery (like TBP and TAF135) are degraded by the proteasome (2).
BIOCARTA_RAS_PATHWAY,Ras Signaling Pathway,"Ras activates many signaling cascades. Here we illustrate some of the well-characterized cascades in a generic compilation of effector molecules. The effectors mediate Ras stimulation to a diverse set of cellular signals. Many of these signals are interpreted differently depending on the cell type or microenvironment receiving the stimulus. Not all of these effectors are activated in any given cell type. The primary method of activation is to promote the translocation of the molecule to the plasma membrane where additional interactions lead to the activation of the molecule. RalGDS is a Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF) for Ral but also has other independent functions. RalGDS activates RalA/B-related small GTPases. RalBP1 is a GTPase activating protein that leads to the inhibition of the Rac and CDC42 GTPases. Ral can also interact with phospholipase D1 (PLD1) that can also be activated by RhoA. Ras stimulation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3K occurs through an interaction with the p110 catalytic subunit. PI3K phosphorylates the D3 position of phosphatidylinositides. In this example Pip2 is converted to PIP3. PIP3 stimulates the AKT/PKB kinase and several of the Rac-GEFs such as Sos1 AND Vav. AKT activation inhibits apoptosis by inhibiting the actions of Bad, Caspase9 and AFX. AKT further hinders apoptosis by phosphorylating the IkB repressor of NFkB. Stimulus of Rac causes among other things the activation of NFkB. Ras also stimulates the mitogen-activated kinases ERK1/2 via the Raf1 cascade. The Erk kinases translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate various transcription factors such as ELK1"
BIOCARTA_RB_PATHWAY,RB Tumor Suppressor/Checkpoint Signaling in response to DNA damage,"Cell cycle checkpoint controls at the G1 to S transition and the G2 to M transition prevent the cell cycle from progressing when DNA is damaged. The ATM protein kinase detects DNA damage and in response to this activates DNA repair factors and inhibits cell cycle progression. Two of the proteins that ATM phosphorylates in response to DNA damage are the tumor suppressor p53 and the checkpoint kinase chk1. In turn, the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with p21 to block the activity of cdk2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2) preventing passage from G1 to S phase and harmful replication of damaged DNA. One of the targets of cdk2 is the Rb gene product, another tumor suppressor. When dephosphorylated, Rb interacts with E2F transcription factors and prevents transcription of genes required for progression through the cell cycle. When phosphorylated by cell cycle dependent kinases like cdk2 and cdk4, Rb no longer interacts with E2F and the cell cycle proceeds through the G1-S checkpoint. DNA damage also regulates the G2-M phase transition by acting on the cell cycle regulator cdc2."

BIOCARTA_RHO_PATHWAY,Rho cell motility signaling pathway,"RhoA is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell morphology via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. The majority of RhoA activations is due to disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell morphology. RhoA is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. The RhoGAP ARHGAP1 also acts as a GAP for Rac and CDC42. Active RhoA increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several different factors downstream of RhoA act on cytoskeletal structures to affect stability of these structures. Rock1 provides a direct link from RhoA to cell morphology through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Rock1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses this activity. According to Nimnual et al. Rho activity is reduced as a result of Rac-induced redox-dependent inhibition. Related Disease: Non-syndromic deafness appears to be the result of amino acid substitutions in the 52-amino acid C-terminal end of Dia 1. This modification creates a constituatively active Dia 1 protein. A mutation in the RhoGAP Oligophrenin-1 is thought to contribute to a form of mental retardation due to loss of Rho inhibition in neuronal development."
BIOCARTA_RHODOPSIN_PATHWAY,Visual Signal Transduction, 
BIOCARTA_RNA_PATHWAY,Double Stranded RNA Induced Gene Expression,"One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis."

BIOCARTA_SALMONELLA_PATHWAY,How does salmonella hijack a cell,"Pathogenic Salmonella enter cells such as those of the intestinal epithelium by altering cellular cytoskeletal structure and inducing membrane ruffling of the infected cell. Salmonella is able to alter the cytoskeleton and membrane through the action of secreted bacterial Sip proteins, SopE, SopB, and SptP that are inserted into the cytosol of the infected cell. Sip proteins encoded by Salmonella are required for the action of SopE and for the invasion of epithelial cells. SipA stabilizes actin filaments, inducing membrane ruffling and perhaps focusing membrane changes where bacteria are localized to allow their entry. SipC produces a similar effect on actin filaments and cytoskeletal structure. SopE acts as an exchange factor on Rac1 and Cdc42, two GTPases in the Rho family that regulate actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 by Salmonella SopE induces changes in cytoskeleton structure that allow bacterial entry into the cell. SopB is another salmonella protein that acts as an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and also stimulates Cdc42 and Rac1. One of the cellular targets of both Cdc42 and Rac1 that affects actin structure is the Arp2/3 complex. Cdc42 and Rac1 activate Wasp, which activates Arp2/3. Activated Arp2/3 induces the formation of actin Y branches, which in combination with changes in actin caused by SipA and SipC help to form lamellipodia, and causes membrane ruffling, leading to entry of Salmonella into the affected cell. After the initial infection, cells quickly return to their normal morphology, a process that depends on the action of the bacterial protein SptP. While SopE acts as an exchange factor, SptP acts as a GTPase activating protein to inactivate Rac1 and Cdc42 once again. This inactivation of the original entry mechanism provides an example of the delicate balance between infectious organisms and their host."

BIOCARTA_SARS_PATHWAY,SARS Coronavirus Protease,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has affected thousands of individuals, causing fever, and pneumonia with a mortality rate estimated at 10-18%. A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause agent and its genome has been sequenced. Human coronaviruses cause mild respiratory illness and accounts for about a third of all cases of the common cold. The enveloped SARS virus contains a large + strand RNA genome, approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Examination of the SARS coronavirus sequences reveals that rep gene covers over 20,000 nucleotides and encodes two overlapping polyproteins cleaved by viral proteases into smaller protein products. Translation of the longer polyprotein encoded by the rep gene requires a ribosomal frameshift. Other viral genes are predicted to encode the transmembrane spike protein S involved in viral fusion with host cells, the envelope protein E, the membrane protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N that binds to the RNA genome as well as several additional open reading frames with unknown functions. Viral entry into the cell is followed by translation of the viral rep gene, which codes for a viral protease within the polyprotein, Mpro or 3CLpro. The SARS 3CLpro has also been verified in vitro to cleave after the Gln residue at Leu-Gln-(Ser, Ala, Gly),. Polypeptides released from the polyproteins by the main viral protease Mpro or 3CLpro include the viral polymerase and a protease. Both products are essential for viral replication and transcription. Structural crystals of a porcine coronavirus protease with a transition state inhibitor suggest that inhibitors of the distantly related rhinovirus protease like the drug AG7088 may be modified to produce drugs that block the SARS protease and viral replication. Blocking entry of the SARS virus into cells, involving recognition of cellular receptors by the S spike protein, may provide another strategy for the development of drugs to treat SARS."
BIOCARTA_SET_PATHWAY,Granzyme A mediated Apoptosis Pathway,"One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin proteins form pores in the membranes of the attacked cell, allowing the entry of Granzyme A and Granzyme B. Granzyme B induces caspase activation and cleavage of factors like ICAD, releasing DFF40 to fragment DNA, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Granzyme A is also an abundant granzyme released by cytotoxic T cells and is important in cytotoxic T cell induced apoptosis, activating caspase independent pathways. Once in a cell, Granzyme A activates DNA nicking by the recently identified DNAse NM23-H1, a tumor suppressor gene product whose expression is reduced in transformed, metastatic cells. The previous identification of NM23-H1 as a tumor suppressor indicates that its DNAse activity plays an important role in immune surveillance to prevent cancer through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of NM23-H1 occurs indirectly, through the cleavage of proteins that inhibit NM23-H1 in the SET complex, which includes SET, Ape1, pp32 and HMG2. SET is a substrate for the Granzyme A protease, and SET cleavage relieves NM23-H1 inhibition to cause apoptotic DNA degradation. In addition to inhibiting NM23-H1, SET has nucleosome assembly activity and also may help the interaction of transcriptional regulation with chromatin structure by interacting with the transcriptional coactivator CBP. The targets of Granzyme A found in the SET complex also have other important functions. Ape1 repairs oxidative DNA damage, reduces transcription factors involved in immediate early responses, and its cleavage by Granzyme A may contribute to DNA degradation and apoptosis. HMG2 is an acidic chromatin-associated protein that bends DNA, alters chromatin structure and alters the accessibility of genes for transcription. In addition to acting as a nucleosome assembly factor and an inhibitor of NM23-H1, SET inhibits DNA and histone methylation by the CBP transcriptional coactivator. The tumor suppressor pp32 is not cleaved by Granzyme A but is part of the SET complex. Other targets of Granzyme A include nuclear lamins responsible for maintaining nuclear structure and histones, the basic building blocks of chromatin structure. The common involvement of the proteins of the SET complex in chromatin structure and DNA repair suggest that they work together to protect chromatin and DNA structure and that inactivation of the complex contributes to apoptosis by blocking the maintenance of DNA and chromatin structural integrity."
BIOCARTA_SHH_PATHWAY,Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) Pathway,"Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is one of a family of three secreted proteins, including Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh), that play distinct and crucial roles in development. The morphogenic signal Shh provides in the developing CNS induces proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum and other tissues. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas, while activation of Shh signaling in neurons may also provide a means to induce neuronal regeneration. Mitogenic Shh signaling does not appear to involve Map kinase pathways, but may involve induction of Cyclin D1 expression to maintain Rb in the hyperphosphorylated state and allow progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Activation of myc may be one mechanism by which Shh induces cell cycle progression. Activation of Shh proliferative signaling occurs through binding to a receptor complex including Patched (Ptc-1) and Smoothened, a G-protein coupled receptor. Patched is an integral membrane protein with twelve transmembrane domains that acts as an inhibitor of Smoothened activation. Patched has been classified as a tumor suppressor due to its inhibition of Smoothened and the presence of inactivated Ptc-1 mutations in some cancers. One possibility is that Ptc-1, which resembles transmembrane channels, may not directly associate with Smoothened but may repress Smoothened signaling by transporting an endogenous Smoothened inhibitor across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. Small non-peptidic agonists and antagonists of the Shh pathway have been identified and appear to act at the level of the Smoothened receptor, providing pharmacological tools to study Shh signaling. The pathway downstream of the Smoothened receptor has remained somewhat unclear, but involves the Gli family of transcriptional activators, including Gli-1, Gli-2, and Gli-3, homologs of the drosophila gene cubitis interruptis. Kinases including GSK-3 and PKA oppose activation of the Shh pathway, perhaps by regulating the stability of Shh pathway intermediate signaling factors transcription factors. Supressor of Fused (SUFU) interacts directly with Gli proteins, repressing Shh signaling while Dyrk1 is a kinase that acts by a distinct pathway to stimulate Gli1 activation of transcription. The multiplicity of factors involved in Shh signaling creates many opportunities for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of cancer and possibly neurodegenerative diseases."
BIOCARTA_SKP2E2F_PATHWAY,E2F1 Destruction Pathway,"E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2/cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2/cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2/cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S/G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical, increasing in the S/G2 transition as E2F-1 is degraded. Knowledge of E2F-1 activity and its regulation form part of the complex set of interactions regulating the cell cycle and potential targets for the treatment of cancer."

BIOCARTA_SM_PATHWAY,Spliceosomal Assembly, 
BIOCARTA_SODD_PATHWAY,SODD/TNFR1 Signaling Pathway,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily contains several members with homologous cytoplasmic domains known as death domains (DD). The intracellular DD are important in initiating apoptosis and other signaling pathways following ligand binding by the receptors.1 In the absence of ligand, DD-containing receptors are maintained in an inactive state. TNF RI contains a cytoplasmic DD required for signaling pathways associated with apoptosis and NF-kB activation.2,3 Jiang et al.4 identified a widely expressed 60 kDa protein, named SODD (silencer of death domains), associated with the DD of TNF RI and DR3. Overexpression of SODD suppresses TNF-induced cell death and NF-kB activation demonstrating its role as a negative regulatory protein for these signaling pathways. TNF-induced receptor trimerization aggregates the DD of TNF RI and recruits the adapter protein TRADD.3,5 This in turn promotes the recruitment of the DD-containing cytoplasmic proteins FADD, TRAF2 and RIP to form an active TNF RI signaling complex (Figure 1A).6-9 In contrast, SODD acts as a silencer of TNF RI signaling and does not interact with TRADD, FADD, or RIP (Figure 1B).4 It is associated with the DD of TNF RI and maintains TNF RI in an inactive, monomeric state. TNF-induced aggregation of TNF RI promotes the disruption of the SODD-TNF RI complex. SODD does not interact with the DD of other TNF receptor superfamily members such as Fas, DR4, DR5, or TNF RII. SODD association with TNF RI may represent a general model for the prevention of spontaneous TNF signaling by other DD-containing receptors."
BIOCARTA_SPPA_PATHWAY,Aspirin Blocks Signaling Pathway Involved in Platelet Activation,"Activation of the protease-activated GPCRs in platelets contributes to platelet activation in clotting. The protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved by the protease thrombin, releasing a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor and triggers intracellular calcium release. Platelets from mice lacking the PAR4 gene are not activated by thrombin and are impaired in clotting, supporting the importance of thrombin signaling through PAR4 in clotting. Human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, with PAR1 playing a more dominant role in clotting in humans. Calcium release induced by PARs activates PKC, modulating integrin alpha IIB beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) and opening integrin ligand binding sites to contribute to platelet aggregation. Intracellular calcium increases induced by thrombin activates phospholipase A2, liberating arachidonic acid, the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis. Ras/Map kinase activation by the PAR receptors also activates phospholipase A2. The activation of PAR-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by aspirin, indicating that thromboxane production induced by PAR signaling contributes to platelet activation. Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin PGG2 by the enzyme Cox-1 in platelets, and Cox-1 is inhibited by aspirin, reducing thromboxane A2 production by platelets. Thromboxane is a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet activator, so inhibition of Cox-1 in platelets by aspirin may explain some of the cardioprotective actions of aspirin."
BIOCARTA_SPRY_PATHWAY,Sprouty regulation of tyrosine kinase signals,"Four different members of the Sprouty protein family block the cellular proliferation and differentiation induced by several different growth factors, including EGF and FGF. One mechanism by which Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling is through binding to Grb-2, a signaling intermediary between the tyrosine kinase growth factors and the Ras/map kinase pathway. Binding of Sprouty to Grb-2 prevents Grb-2 and Sos-1 from interacting with downstream signaling factors that activate Ras and map kinases, including Ras, Raf-1, Mek1, Erk1/2 and downstream transcription factors. The action of Sprouty as an inhibitor of this pathway requires Sprouty phosphorylation and membrane localization, at the site of the factors it interacts with. The inhibition of growth factor signaling by Sprouty is specific to the Ras pathway since the PI3 Kinase pathway responsible for cell survival signals from growth factor receptors is not inhibited by Sprouty. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is also not affected. The mechanism by which Sprouty inhibits Ras activation may be by blocking the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. Sprouty expression is induced by growth factor receptor activation of Ras signaling, provided a self-regulatory feedback inhibition mechanism that regulates growth factor signaling through Ras. In addition to blocking the Ras pathway, Sprouty also induces protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity. Activation of PTP1B by Sprouty is responsible for the inhibition of cellular migration that Sprouty causes, but is not involved in regulation of cellular proliferation. While blocking receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, at least one member of the Sprouty family, Sprouty-2, also acts by one mechanism to stimulate EGF receptor signaling. Cbl targets the EGF receptor for tagging with ubiquitin and proteolytic destruction. Sprouty-2 binds to Cbl and blocks the ubiquitination and destruction of the EGF receptor, increasing EGF signaling."
BIOCARTA_SRCRPTP_PATHWAY,Activation of Src by Protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha,"Progression through the cell cycle is accompanied by activation of the proto-oncogene c-Src, a protein tyrosine kinase. Overexpression of Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein substrates and cellular transformation. During interphase the Src protein folds back upon itself to stay in the inactive state, with a phophotyrosine residue in one domain at Tyrosine 529 bound by an SH2 domain in the same protein. Activation of c-Src involves protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTP-alpha, or RPTP-alpha), a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic phosphatase domain. A variety of evidence has indicated that PTP-alpha dephosphorylates c-Src at Tyr529, allowing Src to open up and become activated, and that this activation occurs in association with mitosis. To activate Src, PTP-alpha must first open up the folded Src through binding itself to the phosphorylated Src domain, a process blocked by binding of Grb-2 to PTP-alpha at phosphorylated Tyr789. PTP-alpha phosphorylated at Tyr789 also binds to the Src SH2 domain, causing the Src structure to open at Src Tyr529 to become available for dephosphorylation. During mitosis the mitotic kinase Cdc-2 phosphorylates Src, along with other cellular substrates, and in so doing makes Src more prone PTP-alpha dephosphorylation and activation. The activity of PTP-alpha toward Src is also regulated by phosphorylation of PTP-alpha by protein kinase C at serines 180 and 204, releasing the inhibition of PTP-alpha by Grb-2. In the normal cell cycle, Src activity is down-regulated after cell division through dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases and phosphorylation by Csk (C-terminal src kinase) and PTP-alpha dephoshorylation returns the cycle to its interphase condition. The regulation of Src activity during mitosis demonstrates how protein phosphorylation can shifts the delicate equilibrium of molecular interactions and cellular responses."
BIOCARTA_STAT3_PATHWAY,Stat3 Signaling Pathway, 
BIOCARTA_STATHMIN_PATHWAY,Stathmin and breast cancer resistance to antimicrotubule agents,"Stathmin is a ubiquitous, cytosolic 19-kDa protein, which is phosphorylated on up to four sites in response to many regulatory signals within cells. Its molecular characterization indicates a functional organization including an N-terminal regulatory domain that bears the phosphorylation sites, linked to a putative alpha-helical binding domain predicted to participate in coiled-coil, protein-protein interactions. In addtion to the protein kinases that phospjhorylate Stathmin such as CaMK, MAPK, p34cdc2, PKA, a few other proteins have been suggested to interact with stathmin in vivo. One of them was identified as BiP, a member of the hsp70 heat-shock protein family. Another is a previously unidentified, putative serine/threonine kinase, KIS, which might be regulated by stathmin or, more likely, be part of the kinases controlling its phosphorylation state. Finally, two proteins, CC1 and CC2, predicted to form alpha-helices participating in coiled-coil interacting structures. It has been also suggest that the action of antimicrotubule drugs can be affected by stathmin in at least two ways: (a) altered drug binding; and (b) growth arrest at the G2 to M boundary. Mutant p53 breast cancers exhibiting high levels of stathmin may be resistant to antimicrotubule agents."
BIOCARTA_STEM_PATHWAY,Regulation of hematopoiesis by cytokines,"The process of hematopoesis is regulated by various cytokines. The combination of cytokines stimulates the proliferation and/or differentiation of the various hematopoietic cell types. Bone marrow stromal cells are the major source of hematopoietic cytokines in the non-infecteous state. In the presence of infection, cytokines produced by activated macrophages and TH cells induce hematopoietic activity. The induction by cytokines results in rapid expansion of the population of white blood cells to fight infection. The specific cytokines that affect a step of cell differentiation are placed adjacent to the arrow representing that step. Lines with '?' indicate likely, but still hypothetical pathways."
BIOCARTA_STRESS_PATHWAY,TNF/Stress Related Signaling,"TNF acts on several different signaling pathways through two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 to regulate apoptotic pathways, NF-kB activation of inflammation, and activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Interaction of TNFR1 with TRADD leads to activation of NF-kB and apoptosis pathways, while interaction with TRAF2 has generally been thought to be involved in stress kinase and NF-kB activation but is not required for TNF to induce apoptosis. Activation of NF-kB is mediated by TRAF2 through the NIK kinase and also by RIP but the observation that TNF activates NF-kB in mice lacking TRAF2 indicates that TRAF-2 does not play an essential role in this process. Stress-activated protein kinases, also called JNKs, are a family of map kinases activated by cellular stress and inflammatory signals. Binding of TNF to the TNFR1 receptor activates the germinal center kinase (GCK) through the TNF adaptor Traf2, activating the map kinase MEKK1. Both GCK and MEKK1 interact with Traf2, and GCK is required for MEKK1 activation by TNF, but GCK kinase activity does not appear to be required for MEKK1 activation. Instead, GCK activates MEKK1 by causing MEKK1 oligomerization and autophosphorylation. Tank increases the affinity of Traf2 for GCK to increase Map kinase activation by TNF. Once activated, MEKK1 stands at the top of a map kinase pathways leading to transcriptional regulation, including JNK phosphorylation of c-Jun to stimulate transcriptional activation by AP-1, a heterodimer of c-jun and fos or ATF proteins. The activation of the p38 Map kinase also contributes to AP-1 activation leading to the transcriptional activation of many stress and growth related genes. RIP has been suggested as a component of the p38 pathway in addition to playing a role in NF-kB activation. MEKK1 knockout mice support the role of MEKK1 in JNK activation in some cells but did not support MEKK1 dependent activation of NF-kB. Alternative redundant mechanisms may obscure the role of MEKK1 in NF-kB mechanisms. TNF activation of stress kinase pathways and downstream transcription factors may help to modulate the apoptotic pathways also activated by TNF."

BIOCARTA_TALL1_PATHWAY,TACI and BCMA stimulation of B cell immune responses.,"TACI and BCMA signal transduction pathway that enhances cell survival APRIL and BAFF (also called TALL-I and BLyS) are TNF family members that act as ligands for the BCMA and TACI receptors. Both APRIL and BAFF bind to both the BCMA and TACI receptors to activate the humoral immune response, stimulating B cell immunoglobulin production and proliferation. BAFF is found as a membrane bound form in T cells and a soluble form that is released from the cell to stimulate B cell proliferation and differentiation. As members of the TNF receptor gene family, BCMA and TACI interact with TRAF family members to transduce signals downstream to NF-kappaB activation and MAP kinase pathways. Abnormally active BAFF or APRIL signaling may play a role in autoimmune disorders such as lupus."
BIOCARTA_TCAPOPTOSIS_PATHWAY,HIV Induced T Cell Apoptosis,HIV infection is associated with immunosuppression caused by a dramatic reduction in the helper T cell population. The loss of helper T cells may be caused by HIV-induced apoptosis of both infected and uninfected helper T cells. HIV uses the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor for macrophage cell entry and upregulates fas-ligand on these cells. CD4 on helper T cells is essential for viral cell entry and infection. Cross-linking of CD4 on the T cell surface may be involved in upregulation of Fas and sensitization of T cells to apoptosis induced by the Fas/Fas-ligand interaction.
BIOCARTA_TCR_PATHWAY,T Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway,The T Cell Receptor plays a key role in the immune system. The specificity of the receptor is governed by the binding site formed from the mature alpha and beta chains (shown here) or gamma and delta chains in gamma/delta T Cells. It is the ability of this receptor to bind a complex of foreign peptide in the groove of an MHC molecule that leads to T cell activation. Upon activation the T cell can assist in activating other cells or carry out cytolytic attacks depending on the particular T cell type. The CD3 complex and CD4 (Th cells) or CD8 (Tc cells) work to transmit the activation signal to the T cell's transcriptional machinary upon engagement of the receptor.
BIOCARTA_TCRA_PATHWAY,Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation,"T cell activation is initiated by recognition of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of Class II MHC on an antigen-presenting cell. The T cell receptor contains multiple subunits and interacts with several factors to transduce antigen-stimulated T cell activation. One of the key steps that initiates receptor activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR subunits by the src family protein kinases Lck and Fyn. T cell receptor phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn recruits the ZAP-70 protein kinase to the receptor complex, which becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways like the Map kinase cascade. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase activates Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating these proteins and is required for TCR activation. Association of the CD4 coreceptor with Lck may also be involved in Lck activation."
BIOCARTA_TCYTOTOXIC_PATHWAY,T Cytotoxic Cell Surface Molecules,"Cytotoxic T cells are a key part of the cellular immune response, killing cells that display foreign antigen on their surface, primarily virus-infected cells. Transformed cells can also be detected and eliminated by cytotoxic T cells. There are two mechanisms by which activated cytotoxic T cells kill cells presenting specific antigen. One method involves the release of secretory granules containing perforin and granzyme to induce lysis of the targeted cell. Cytotoxic T cells also express Fas ligand to bind to Fas on target cells and induce apoptosis. Communication with and interaction with other cell types is essential for cytotoxic T cell function. Distinct types of T cells are characterized and their activities determined by the proteins they express on their cell surface. Cytotoxic T cells will only respond to antigen presented on the surface of cells bound to MHC I proteins, not antigens present in solution. The T cell receptor, with the multiprotein CD3 complex, is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens, triggering the activation and proliferation of cells. Cytotoxic T cell activation also requires additional signals provided by helper T cells in addition to signals provided by antigen-presenting cells. Thy1 provides a general marker of T cells, and the presence of CD8 protein that binds to MHC distinguishes cytotoxic T cells from CD4 positive helper T cells. CD28 expressed by T cells acts as a costimulatory signal with the T cell receptor when it binds its ligand, a B-7 coreceptor, on antigen-presenting cells. Inappropriate regulation of the costimulatory signal can lead to too great or too small of an immune response. Interaction of activated cytotoxic T cells is aided by increased expression of LFA-1, a cell-adhesion molecule that binds to ICAM on target cells. CD2 is a T cell adhesion molecule. Mice with a disrupted CD2 gene are largely normal and appear to have a normal immune system, but CD2 on cytotoxic T cells may assist in interaction with target cells."
BIOCARTA_TEL_PATHWAY,"Telomeres, Telomerase, Cellular Aging, and  Immortality","Telomeres, which define the ends of chromosomes, consist of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences loosely conserved in eukaryotes. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex ( we only show a few of the components in this illustration) which in vitro recognizes a single-stranded G-rich telomere primer and adds multiple telomeric repeats to its 3-prime end by using an RNA template. Telomerase may also have a role in de novo formation of telomeres. Telomerase has been identified in many cultured cell lines and actively dividing cell types. The active reverse transcriptase component has been identified in teh TERT protein. The presence of this factor determines the availability of the telomerase function. The TERT protein has a high turnover rate and its expression is regulated by factors that promote growth (c-MYC, v-k-ras, Bcl-2 and E6) and inhibiting factors (RB and p53) that promote cell death or that block cell division. It appears that the regulation of active telomerase has many levels and can be inhibited by TEP1 not releasing TERT or by TRF1 which binds the end repeats and prevents access to the chromosome ends. Additional modulation is due to phosphorlyation by PKC and AKT or dephophorylation by PP2A. Wilke et al found that a case of human alpha-thalassemia was caused by a truncation of chromosome 16 that had been healed by the addition of telomeric repeats (TTAGGG)n. Human telomeres consist of many kilobases of (TTAGGG)n together with various associated proteins. Small amounts of these terminal sequences are lost from the tips of the chromosomes during each S phase because of incomplete DNA replication, but de novo addition of TTAGGG repeats by the enzyme telomerase compensates for this loss. Many human cells progressively lose terminal bases with each cell division, a loss that correlates with the apparent absence of telomerase in these cells. There has been considerable interest in the possible relationship between human telomeres and cellular senescence and immortalization. This interest includes the question of a role in the malignant process and the question of the use of telomerase inhibitors as anti-tumor drugs."

BIOCARTA_TFF_PATHWAY,Trefoil Factors Initiate  Mucosal Healing,"Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2/TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP)/TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF)/TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to mucin expression and possibly tumor suppression. Cell migration is the result of integrated disruption of cellcell and cellsubstratum adhesion and prevention of apoptosis through cell detachment. Epithelial movement therefore requires integration of motogenic and cell-survival signals. This is achieved by activation of several intracellular signalling pathways that converge on ERK/MAPK and possibly NF-B activation. Serine phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1 and 2 is central to trefoil factor -mediated signalling, lying downstream of EGFR activation and possibly FAK activation (through recruitment of GRB2 and SOS). Cell migration might result from cooperation between ERK/MAPKs and Rho proteins, FAK activation, beta-integrin clustering and beta-catenin activation. Abrogation of cell death has been shown to require both PI3K activation and ERK/MAPK activation; the former operates through serine/threonine phosphorylation of AKT/protein kinase B, serine phosphorylation of BAD (BCL-2 agonist of cell death) and inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and formation of the apoptosome (APAF1, caspase-9 (CASP9) and cytochrome c (CYT-c). Translocation of phosphorylated ERK/MAPK to the nucleus leads to amplification and de-restriction of TFF expression to ensure sustained action."
BIOCARTA_TGFB_PATHWAY,TGF beta signaling pathway,"TGF-beta regulates growth and proliferation of cells, blocking growth of many cell types. The TGF-beta receptor includes type 1 and type 2 subunits that are serine-threonine kinases and that signal through the SMAD family of transcriptional regulators. Defects in TGF-beta signaling, includes mutation in SMADs, have been associated with cancer in humans. Prior to activation, receptor regulated SMADs are anchored to the cell membrane by factors like SARA (SMAD Anchor for Receptor Activation) that brings the SMADs into proximity of the TGF receptor kinases. Binding of TGF induces phosphorylation and activation of the TGF-beta R1 receptor by the TGF-beta R2 receptor. The activated TGF-beta R1 phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3, which bind to the SMAD4 mediator to move into the nucleus and form complexes that regulate transcription. SMADs regulate transcription in several ways, including binding to DNA, interacting with other transcription factors, and interacting with transcription corepressors and coactivators like p300 and CBP. SMAD-7 represses signaling by other SMADs to down-regulate the system. Other signaling pathways like the MAP kinase-ERK cascade are activated by TGF-beta signaling, modulate SMAD activation. SnoN also regulates TGF-beta signaling, by binding to SMADs to block transcriptional activation. TGF-beta signaling causes degradation of SnoN, releasing SMADs to regulate transcription, and also activates expression of SnoN, to down-regulate SMAD signaling at later times."
BIOCARTA_TH1TH2_PATHWAY,Th1/Th2 Differentiation,"Helper T cells are found in two distinct cell types, Th1 and Th2, distinguished by the cytokines they produce and respond to and the immune responses they are involved in. Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-g, TNF-b and IL-2, while Th2 cells produce the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. The cytokines produced by Th1 cells stimulate the phagocytosis and destruction of microbial pathogens while Th2 cytokines like IL-4 generally stimulate the production of antibodies directed toward large extracellular parasites. IL-5 stimulates eosinophil responses, also part of the immune response toward large extracellular parasites Th1 and Th2 are produced by differentiation from a non-antigen exposed precursor cell type, Thp. Exposure of Thp cells to antigen by antigen-presenting cells may result in their differentiation to Th0 cells, not yet committed to become either Th1 or Th2 cells, although the existence of Th0 cells is controversial. Cells committed as either Th1 and Th2 cells are called polarized, whether they are effector cells actively secreting cytokines or are memory cells. The stimulation of Thp cells by exposure to antigen-presenting cells induces the proliferation of undifferentiated cells, and their expression of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor. The differentiation of Th1 cells and Th2 cells depends on the cytokines they are exposed to. IL-12 causes Th1 differentiation and blocks Th2 cell production , while IL-4 causes Th2 differentiation and antagonizes Th1 development. IL-18 also induces Th1 differentiation. Polarized Th1 and Th2 cells also express distinct sets of chemokine receptors that further modify their homing and other cellular responses. Improved understanding of Th1 and Th2 differentiation will improve our overall understanding of the immune system, its response to infection and aberrant responses that lead to disease."
BIOCARTA_THELPER_PATHWAY,T Helper Cell Surface Molecules,"T helper cells play an essential role coordinating the activities of other parts of the immune system, including B cells, cytotoxic T cells, macrophages and other cells. The crucial nature of helper T cells in the normal immune response is demonstrated by the severe immune deficiency associated with the HIV-induced helper T cell depletion. To communicate with other cells, helper T cells express a range of cell surface molecules, a few of which are illustrated in this figure. Like all T cells, helper T cells express T cell receptors complexed with the CD3 proteins that are responsible for the recognition and response of the cell to specific antigens. CD4 is commonly used as a marker for helper T cells, in contrast to cytotoxic T cells, which express CD8. CD4 is used by HIV to gain cell entry, as well as the CCR5 chemokine receptor. Thy1 provides a more general cell surface antigen used to identify both T helper and cytotoxic T cells. CD28 provides a costimulatory signal in association with the activation of the T cell receptor complex by an antigen presenting cell that is required for the T cell to become activated. Adhesion molecules on the surface of T cells assist in their interaction with other cells. LFA-1 binds to its ligand ICAM-1 in a variety of cells and T cells themselves also express ICAM-1. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates factors in the pathways involved in B cells and T cells activation. Although CD45 is required for T cell receptor activation, exclusion of CD45 from the local membrane region near the T cell receptor appears important for efficient T cell activation. Helper T cells can be subdivided further into Th1 and Th2 cells, distinguished by their response to different antigens, differing cytokine expression and expression of different chemokine receptors CD2 is required for efficient helper T cell maturation and stimulates their differentiation, but does not select for a specific increase in Th1 or Th2 populations of cells."
BIOCARTA_TID_PATHWAY,Chaperones modulate interferon Signaling Pathway,"Signaling by interferon-gamma stimulates anti-viral responses and tumor suppression through the heterodimeric interferon-gamma receptor. Signaling is initiated by binding of interferon-gamma to its receptor, activating the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate STAT transcription factors that activate interferon responsive genes. Molecular chaperones that modulate or alter protein folding interact with different components of the interferon signaling pathway. One chaperone that modulates interferon signaling is hTid-1, a member of the DnaJ family of chaperones and a cochaperone for the heat shock protein Hsp70, another molecular chaperone. hTid-1 was found in a two-hybrid screen to bind to JAK2 and also to interact with the interferon-gamma receptor. In addition, hTid-1 and JAK2 also interact with Hsp70. Overexpression of hTid-1 represses transcriptional activation by interferon-gamma and Hsp70 dissociates from these proteins when interferon is added to cells, suggesting that Hsp70 holds Jak2 in an inactive conformation prior to ligand activation, and is released in the presence of agonist to allow the activation of Jak-2 and downstream pathways. hTid-1 and Hsp-70 interact with other signaling proteins as well. One of this is Tax, a protein encoded by the HTLV-1 virus that binds to hTid-1. hTid-1 also represses NF-kB activation by blocking the phosphorylation and inactivation of I-kappaB by the IkappaB kinase beta. Hsp70 plays a significant role in protein unfolding for entry into mitochondria and also interacts with tumor suppressor gene products to produce their anti-proliferative activity. One of the actions of interferon is to induce apoptosis of infected target cells, in part through a mitochondrial dependent mechanism. An interaction between interferon signaling and Hsp70 may alter this mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, perhaps playing a role in interferon-mediated apoptosis of infected or transformed cells. The HTLV-1 Tax protein that interacts with Hsp70 blocks mitochondrial induced apoptosis, providing a protection against interferon-mediated cellular defenses."
BIOCARTA_TNFR1_PATHWAY,TNFR1 Signaling Pathway,"TNFR1 (a.k.a. p55, CD120a) is the receptor for TNF(alpha) and also will bind TNF(beta). Upon binding TNF(alpha) a TNFR1+ cell is triggered to undergo apoptosis. This critical regulatory process is accomplished by activating the proteolytic caspase cascade that results in the degradation of many critical cellular proteins."
BIOCARTA_TNFR2_PATHWAY,TNFR2 Signaling Pathway,"TNFR2 is the receptor for the 171 amino acid 19 kD TNF(beta) (a.k.a. lymphotoxin). TNF(beta) is produced by activated lymphocytes and can be cytotoxic to many tumor and other cells. In neutrophils, endothelial cells and osteoclasts TNF(beta) can lead to activation while in many other cell types it can lead to increased expression of MHC and adhesion molecules."
BIOCARTA_TOB1_PATHWAY,Role of Tob in T-cell activation,"Regulation of T cell activation is a crucial component of balanced functioning of the immune system. If the T cell response is too great and activation of self-responsive cells or unstimulated cells is not suppressed, then autoimmune disorders or tissue injury can result. Unstimulated T cells are maintained in a quiescent state and the activity of self-reactive T cells is maintained in an anergic state in which IL-2 expression is repressed. IL-2 is a cytokine with a key role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The maintenance of T cells in the anergic or unstimulated state may not involve just an absence of activation, but an active repression of IL-2 expression, T cell proliferation and activation. TGF beta may play a role in suppressing T cell activation. Tob is a factor identified recently that represses T cell activation that is a member of a family of genes with anti-proliferative properties. Tob expression is highest in unstimulated and anergic T cells, and is reduced in activated T cells. Tob interacts with the TGF activated transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD4, increasing their binding to the IL-2 promoter, and helping to repress IL-2 expression. This role of Tob suggests that interference in Tobs function may lead to autoimmune disease."
BIOCARTA_TOLL_PATHWAY,Toll-Like Receptor Pathway,"The innate immune response responds in a general manner to factors present in invading pathogens. Bacterial factors such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin), bacterial lipoproteins, peptidoglycans and also CpG nucleic acids activate innate immunity as well as stimulating the antigen-specific immune response and triggering the inflammatory response. Members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) gene family convey signals stimulated by these factors, activating signal transduction pathways that result in transcriptional regulation and stimulate immune function. TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipoproteins, TLR4 is activated by LPS, and TLR9 is activated by CpG DNA; peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is activated by peptidoglycan (PGN). The downstream signaling pathways used by these receptors are similar to that used by the IL-1 receptor, activating the IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) through the MyD88 adaptor protein, and signaling through TRAF-6 and protein kinase cascades to activate NF-kB and Jun. NF-kB and c-Jun activate transcription of genes such as the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-12. Several recent reports have suggested that the functional outcomes of signaling via TLR2, TLR4 and PGRP are not equivalent. For example, while the LPS-induced, p38-dependent response was dependent upon PU.1 binding, the PGN-induced, p38 response was not. The intracelular receptor for PGN, PGRP is conserved from insects to mammals. In insects, PGRP activates prophenoloxidase cascade, a part of the insect antimicrobial defense system. Because mammals do not have the prophenoloxidase cascade, its function in mammals is unknown. However, it was suggested that an identical protein Tag7 was a tumor necrosis factor-like (TNF-like) cytokine. PGRP/Tag7 possesses cytotoxicity and triggers intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation in target cells in the same way as many known members of the TNF family. Fragmentation of DNA is one of the characteristics of apoptosis. The possibility that in another system, PGRP/Tag7 would induce NF-kB activation, as observed for TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptors canot be ruled out."
BIOCARTA_TPO_PATHWAY,TPO Signaling Pathway,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) binds to its receptor inducing aggregation and activation. TPO signals its growth regulating effects to the cell through several major pathways including MAPK (ERK and JNK), Protein Kinase C, and JAK/Stat."
BIOCARTA_TRKA_PATHWAY,Trka Receptor Signaling Pathway,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that stimulates neuronal survival and growth through TrkA, a member of the trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors that also includes TrkB and TrkC. Some NGF responses are also mediated or modified by p75LNTR, a low affinity neurotrophin receptor. Binding of NGF to TrkA stimulates neuronal survival, and also proliferation. Pathways coupled to these responses are linked to TrkA through association of signaling factors with specific amino acids in the TrkA cytoplasmic domain. Cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis is signaled through activation of PI3-kinase and AKT. Ras-mediated signaling and phospholipase C both activate the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate proliferation."

BIOCARTA_UCALPAIN_PATHWAY,uCalpain and friends in Cell spread,"The mammalian calpain gene family curently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. ( An excellent introduction to the Calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http://ag.arizona.edu/calpains/index.html ) Spreading cells display newly transiently formed integrin adhesion clusters containing Calpain1 (mu-Calpain), cleaved Talin, B3-Integrin and SPTAN1(Spectrin). Recruitment of Rac to these clusters leads to the activation of Rac and the formation of Rac-induced Focal clusters. The Calpain1 in the integrin clusters initially inactivates RhoA allowing for the formation of lamellipodia. The subsequent activation of newly synthesized RhoA transforms these clusters into Focal Adhesion Complexes and the formation of contractile actin-myosin stress fibers. These mature adhesions do not contain calpain."
BIOCARTA_VDR_PATHWAY,Control of Gene Expression by Vitamin D Receptor,"The vitamin D receptor, VDR is the mediator of all genomic actions of vitamin D3 and its analogs. It belongs to a family of ligand induced transcription factors, nuclear receptors (NRs). Vitamin D3 is the main regulator of calcium homeostasis and is critical in bone formation. It is also involved in controlling cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis, which makes synthetic vitamin D3 analogues interesting for therapy of such diseases as cancer and psoriasis. NRs are comprised of: an amino-terminal activation function domain AF-1; the DNA-binding domain; a hinge region; and a carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain containing a second activation function, AF-2. VDR acts primarily as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on vitamin D response elements (VDREs). It interacts with the transcription machinery and nuclear receptor coactivators or corepressors to regulate target gene activity. NRs coregulators can be divided into 3 major classes: 1)ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that are involved in the location and association of nucleosomes with DNA; 2) Enzymes that catalyze modifications of histone tails to regulate histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions 3) General transcription factors adaptors that bridge the functions between regulators and basal transcription factors. A novel multifunctional ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex c WINAC directly interacts with the vitamin D receptor. It contains BRG1 or hBRM as ATPase subunits as all SWI/SNF complexes do, but it also has subunits associated with DNA replication (TopoII_ and CAF-1p150) and transcript elongation through nucleosomes (FACTP140) not found before in SWI/SNF complexes. WINAC also contains the Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF). WSTF appears to function as a platform protein for the assembly of components in WINAC, and it interacts directly with the vitamin D receptor in a ligand-independent manner. WINAC and vitamin Dreceptor are targeted to vitamin D responsive promoters in the absence of ligand to both positively and negatively regulated genes. WINAC may rearrange the nucleosome array around the positive and negative VDREs, thereby facilitating the coregulatory complexes access for further transcription control. Upon ligand binding, two HAT complexes, p160/CBP and TRRAP/PCAF, coactivate the NR function. The p160 proteins (SRC protein family) interact directly with an NR activation surface AF2 and serve as platforms for the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes, including CBP/p300 and methyltransferases. The SRC/p160 family members SRC-1 and p/CIP, as well as CBP and p300 contain intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity(HAT). Both the HAT activity and the histone methyltransferase activity may cooperate in histone modification and facilitate nucleosome remodeling and recruitment of transcriptional machinery. A third group of coactivators is represented by thyroid receptor-associated proteins (TRAP)/vitamin D receptor-interacting proteins (DRIP). This complex may play a role by directly contacting the basal transcriptional machinery. As the VDR/RXR heterodimer also represses transcription in a ligand-dependent manner through negative VDRE (nVDRE), a number of corepressor proteins such as NCoR and ALIEN may also be recruited to the surface of the receptor. They, too function as platforms but serve to recruit enzymes such as histone deacetylases. WINAC association with VDR facilitates targeting of a putative corepressor complex to the nVDRE"
BIOCARTA_VEGF_PATHWAY,"VEGF, Hypoxia, and Angiogenesis","Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in physiological blood vessel formation and pathological angiogenesis such as tumor growth and ischemic diseases. Hypoxia is a potent inducer of VEGF in vitro. The increase in secreted biologically active VEGF protein from cells exposed to hypoxia is partly because of an increased transcription rate, mediated by binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) to a hypoxia responsive element in the 5'-flanking region of the VEGF gene. bHLH-PAS transcription factor that interacts with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), and its predicted amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1a) product. HLF mRNA expression is closely correlated with that of VEGF mRNA.. The high expression level of HLF mRNA in the O2 delivery system of developing embryos and adult organs suggests that in a normoxic state, HLF regulates gene expression of VEGF, various glycolytic enzymes, and others driven by the HRE sequence, and may be involved in development of blood vessels and the tubular system of lung. VEGF expression is dramatically induced by hypoxia due in large part to an increase in the stability of its mRNA. HuR binds with high affinity and specificity to the VRS element that regulates VEGF mRNA stability by hypoxia. In addition, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) ensures efficient translation of VEGF mRNA even under hypoxia. The VHL tumor suppressor (von Hippel-Lindau) regulates also VEGF expression at a post-transcriptional level. The secreted VEGF is a major angiogenic factor that regulates multiple endothelial cell functions, including mitogenesis. Cellular and circulating levels of VEGF are elevated in hematologic malignancies and are adversely associated with prognosis. Angiogenesis is a very complex, tightly regulated, multistep process, the targeting of which may well prove useful in the creation of novel therapeutic agents. Current approaches being investigated include the inhibition of angiogenesis stimulants (e.g., VEGF), or their receptors, blockade of endothelial cell activation, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, and inhibition of tumor vasculature. Preclinical, phase I, and phase II studies of both monoclonal antibodies to VEGF and blockers of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase pathway indicate that these agents are safe and offer potential clinical utility in patients with hematologic malignancies."
BIOCARTA_VIP_PATHWAY,Neuropeptides VIP and PACAP inhibit the apoptosis of activated T cells,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), two neuropeptides present in the lymphoid microenvironment, elicit a broad spectrum of biological functions, including the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Another important immunoregulatory function of VIP and PACAP is their inhibition effect on AICD in T cells. They inhibit the TCR-stimulated FasL expression and apoptosis of T cell through specific receptors and induction of intracellular cAMP. VIP down-regulate c-Myc synthesis, the NF-AT-dependent Egr2 and Egr3 expression, the NF-AT and NF-kB."
BIOCARTA_VITCB_PATHWAY,Vitamin C in the Brain,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was first identified by virtue of the essential role it plays in collagen modification, preventing the nutritional deficiency scurvy. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for hydroxylase enzymes that post-translationally modify collagen to increase the strength and elasticity of tissues. Vitamin C reduces the metal ion prosthetic groups of many enzymes, maintaining activity of enzymes, also acts as an anti-oxidant. Although the prevention of scurvy through modification of collagen may be the most obvious role for vitamin C, it is not necessarily the only role of vitamin C. Svct1 and Svct2 are ascorbate transporters for vitamin C import into tissues and into cells. Both of these transporters specifically transport reduced L-ascorbic acid against a concentration gradient using the intracellular sodium gradient to drive ascorbate transport. Svct1 is expressed in epithelial cells in the intestine, upregulated in cellular models for intestinal epithelium and appears to be responsible for the import of dietary vitamin C from the intestinal lumen. The vitamin C imported from the intestine is present in plasma at approximately 50 uM, almost exclusively in the reduced form, and is transported to tissues to play a variety of roles. Svct2 imports reduced ascorbate from the plasma into very active tissues like the brain. Deletion in mice of the gene for Svct2 revealed that ascorbate is required for normal development of the lungs and brain during pregnancy. A high concentration of vitamin C in neurons of the developing brain may help protect the developing brain from free radical damage. The oxidized form of ascorbate, dehydroascorbic acid, is transported into a variety of cells by the glucose transporter Glut-1. Glut-1, Glut-3 and Glut-4 can transport dehydroascorbate, but may not transport significant quantities of ascorbic acid in vivo."
