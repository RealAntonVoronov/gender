  "Coagulation is a cascade of proteolytic enzymes that leads to the formation of a clot that seals a wound. The clotting cascade begins with a protein activator, tissue factor (TF), which binds to factor VII in the blood. This complex activates factor X and factor IX, which then activate prothrombin. Thrombin, the final enzyme in the cascade, cleaves fibrinogen to release the clot-forming units, fibrin. The clot is stabilized by factor XIII, which cross-links the fibrin molecules.",
  "T cells are a class of white blood cells that play a key role in the immune system by identifying and destroying cells that are infected or that have undergone abnormal replication. The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is responsible for recognizing specific antigens presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and triggering T cell activation. The TCR is a multi-subunit complex that includes the CD3 complex, which is composed of four different polypeptides (epsilon, gamma, delta, and zeta). The zeta subunit is responsible for the dimerization of the other subunits and is responsible for the association of the CD3 complex with the TCR. The CD3 complex is responsible for the association of the TCR with the protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn that are responsible for the phosphorylation of the TCR and other proteins involved in T cell activation.",
  "The complement system is a major part of the innate immune system and plays an important role in the immediate response to microbial infection. The activation of the complement system results in the cleavage of a number of important plasma proteins, leading to the opsonization of bacteria, enhancement of phagocytosis, and the lysis of cells. The classical pathway of complement activation is initiated by the binding of antibodies to foreign antigens, followed by the activation of the classical pathway by the C1 complex. The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, leading to the formation of a C3 convertase that activates the entire cascade. The lectin-mediated pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria by mannan-binding protein (MBP), followed by the activation of the C3 convertase. Factor XII is activated by prekallikrein (PK), which is activated by PK and HK, which is activated by MBP. The thrombin that is generated cleaves the inactive precursor of C3, C3, to C3a and C3b. C3b is involved in the formation of the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 to C3a and the biologically active C5a and C5b. The formation of C3a and C5a leads to the activation of the anaphylotoxins C3a and C5a, which attract phagocytes to the site of infection and increase their phagocytotic activity. The opsonization of bacteria by C3b and the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) by C5b result in the lysis of the bacteria.",
  "Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune mediators. IL-10 signals through a receptor complex that includes a subunit (IL-10RA) that is shared with IL-1ra, another anti-inflammatory cytokine. The IL-10RA subunit is required for signaling by IL-10 but not IL-1ra. The IL-10RA subunit is also required for the formation of a high affinity receptor complex for IL-10 that includes the IL-10RB subunit. The IL-10RA subunit is also required for signaling by IL-2 2, a cytokine that induces the production of inflammatory mediators. Mice with a disrupted IL-10RA gene have an inflammatory bowel disease that resembles human ulcerative colitis. The anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10 may be partially responsible for the ability of IL-10 to inhibit the development of tumors and to prevent the development of atherosclerosis. The ability of IL-10 to inhibit the development of arthritis and autoimmune diabetes has also been demonstrated. The ability of IL-10 to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis may be related to its anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10 may also contribute to the ability of IL-10 to inhibit the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The anti-inflammatory activity of IL-10 may also contribute to the ability of IL-10 to inhibit the development of arthritis and autoimmune diabetes.",
  "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large family of cell surface receptors that respond to a diverse array of extracellular stimuli, including neurotransmitters, hormones, odorants, tastants, light, and lipids. Upon agonist activation, GPCRs catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on heterotrimeric G proteins, which in turn activate a variety of downstream effectors, including the classical G protein effectors, adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, to generate second messengers such as cAMP and IP3. The GPCR signaling is terminated by multiple mechanisms, including receptor desensitization, which is mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins. In addition, GRKs and arrestins also act as adaptor proteins to mediate the internalization of GPCRs. Once internalized, GPCRs can be either rapidly recycled to the plasma membrane via a rapid recycling pathway or be targeted to lysosomes for degradation.",
  "The BCR-ABL oncogene encodes a chimeric protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. BCR-ABL is the causative agent in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (+) CML and ALL. BCR-ABL transforms cells by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. BCR-ABL activates multiple signaling pathways, including Ras, PI 3-kinase, and Stat5. Activation of each of these pathways contributes to BCR-ABL-mediated transformation. Lyn is a Src family kinase that is activated by BCR-ABL and contributes to transformation. Activation of Stat5 by BCR-ABL is required for transformation. Lyn and Stat5 activate each other by a positive feedback loop.",
  "The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a major pathway for the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The cycle begins with the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to form citrate. The cycle then proceeds through a series of eight steps to produce succinyl-CoA, which condenses with oxaloacetate to form succinate. Succinate is then converted to fumarate, which is converted to malate, and finally to pyruvate. The oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA completes the cycle. The conversion of acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide and water is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase (PC). The TCA cycle is a central metabolic pathway that oxidizes acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide and water. This pathway is also the major source of the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2 that are required for the electron transport chain and for ATP synthesis. The TCA cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and is highly compartmentalized. The enzymes of the TCA cycle are located in discrete mitochondrial compartments. The enzymes of the cycle are organized into two major complexes, the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDHC) complex and the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDHC) complex catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. Succinyl-CoA is then converted to succinate by succinyl-CoA ligase. The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). The conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA is catalyzed by succinyl-CoA ligase. The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase (PC). The activities of the KGDHC and PDH complexes are regulated by a variety of factors, including the concentration of its substrates and products, the concentration of ATP and NADH, and the concentration of key metabolites such as acetyl-CoA and the Coenzyme A (CoA).",
  "The cell cycle is a highly conserved set of events that occur in a cell to create two daughter cells. The cell cycle is regulated by a complex set of proteins that interact to create a cell that is either in the G1 phase, S phase, or G2 / M phase. The G1 phase of the cell cycle is the point at which the cell is no longer able to repair DNA damage and enter the next phase of the cell cycle. The S phase of the cell cycle is the point at which the cell is no longer able to replicate its DNA. The G2 / M phase of the cell cycle is the point at which the cell is no longer able to separate its chromosomes and divide. The G1 phase of the cell cycle is the time between the end of mitosis and the S phase. The S phase of the cell cycle is the time between the S phase and the end of mitosis. The G2 phase of the cell cycle is the time between the S phase and the M phase. The checkpoint proteins regulate the cell cycle to allow the cell time to repair DNA damage before progressing through the cell cycle. The checkpoint proteins respond to DNA damage by halting the cell cycle until the damage is repaired. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a role in both the G1 / S and G2 / M checkpoints. The tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 also plays a role in both the G1 / S and G2 / M checkpoints. The checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR respond to DNA damage by halting the cell cycle. The tumor suppressor gene p53 and the checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR respond to DNA damage by halting the cell cycle.",
  "The Rab GTPases are a family of small GTPases that regulate intracellular membrane traffic. They are localized to specific intracellular membranes and function as molecular switches that cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states. The GTP- and GDP-bound forms of the Rab proteins are associated with different membrane compartments. The conversion between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms is regulated by two groups of proteins, the GDP / GTP exchange factors (GEFs) and the GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). The GEFs stimulate the release of GDP and the subsequent binding of GTP, while the GAPs stimulate the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. The activated Rab protein then interacts with a variety of downstream effectors to regulate intracellular membrane traffic. The Rab GTPases are classified into four groups based on sequence homology: the RAB1, RAB2, RAB3, and RAB5 groups. Each group includes several members, each of which is localized to a specific intracellular membrane. The first group of the Rab GTPases, the RAB1 group, includes RAB1B, RAB11B, RAB1A, and RAB1C. They are localized to the ER / Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and regulate transport from the ER to the Golgi. The second group includes RAB2A, RAB2B, and RAB2C, which are localized to the Golgi. They are involved in the transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. The third group includes RAB3A, RAB3B, and RAB3D, which are localized to the synaptic vesicles and regulate exocytosis. The fourth group includes RAB4A, RAB4B, RAB4B, and RAB4C, which are localized to the early endosomes and regulate early endosome to late endosome transport.",
  "Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in the early response to viral infection and tumor surveillance. NK cell activity is regulated by a balance of inhibitory and activating signals. Activating receptors include the Ig-like receptors, NKG2D, the C-type lectin-like receptors, and the integrins. Activating receptors signal through the adaptor proteins DAP1 2 and FcRgamma. Activating receptors also signal through the adaptor protein CD3zeta. Inhibitory receptors include the Ig-like receptors, the MHC-I receptors, and the leukocyte Ig-like receptors. The inhibitory receptors bind to MHC-I and block activation by the activating receptors. The NK cell activating receptors signal through a variety of pathways including the MAP kinase pathway, the PI3 kinase pathway, and the p38 Map kinase pathway.",
  "The complement system is an important part of the immune system that helps to protect the body against infection and injury. The complement system consists of over 3 0 proteins that are found in the blood in a soluble form or bound to the surface of cells. When activated, the complement system helps to alert the immune system to infection and also helps to remove damaged cells. The complement system is activated by three different pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin-induced pathway. Each of these pathways begins with a different pattern recognition molecule that recognizes and binds to a specific molecular pattern associated with an infection or injury. This binding activates the complement system in each case, and the different pathways result in the activation of different proteins in the complement cascade that help to kill the target cell or remove the damaged cell. The three pathways also converge on the C3 protein, which is activated by cleavage and forms a key component of all the activation pathways. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of antibody bound to a pathogen by C1q, the recognition molecule in the classical pathway. The alternative pathway is activated by recognition of a pathogen by a pattern recognition molecule, such as the mannose binding protein in the case of the bacterial lectin-induced pathway. The third pathway is induced by the recognition of carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria by the lectin mannan-binding protein. The three pathways converge on the C3 protein, which is activated by cleavage by C3 convertase to form C3 convertase. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3 molecules to form the C3 convertase, which is the essential point of convergence in the complement cascade. The C3 convertase also cleaves and activates the C5 convertase, which cleaves and activates the C5 protein. The C5 convertase cleaves and activates the C6, C7, C8, and C9 proteins to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which lyses the target cell. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of antibody bound to a pathogen by C1q. The lectin-induced pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria by mannan-binding protein. The alternative pathway is activated by the recognition of a pathogen by a pattern recognition molecule, such as the heat-shock protein in the case of the bacterial lectin-induced pathway. The classical and alternative pathways are both antibody independent pathways, whereas the lectin-induced pathway is antibody dependent. The antibody-dependent pathway is activated by the binding of complement protein C1q to antibody bound to a pathogen. The alternative pathway is not activated by the recognition of a pathogen by a pattern recognition molecule, but is activated by the recognition of carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria by mannan-binding protein.",
  "Inflammasomes are large protein complexes that regulate the activation of caspase-1 in response to inflammatory stimuli. They are formed by the interaction of a sensor molecule, such as a NOD-like receptor, with the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which in turn recruits caspase-1 via CARD-CARD interaction. Caspase-1 then processes pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 to their active forms. Inflammasomes are activated by a variety of stimuli, including bacterial components, ATP, uric acid crystals, amyloid-beta, and environmental toxins.",
  "The protease activated receptors are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by the protease thrombin. The protease activated receptors are cleaved by proteases such as factor Xa and by the protease trypsin. The new N-terminus of the PAR-1 is a ligand for the thrombin receptor. The PAR-1 is found in a variety of tissues and cells including platelets, neurons, endothelial cells and keratinocytes. The cleavage of PAR-1 by thrombin leads to the activation of a number of signaling pathways. One of the major signaling pathways activated by PAR-1 is the MAP kinase pathway. The cleavage of PAR-1 by thrombin leads to the activation of G alpha q and the downstream activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The activation of PAR-1 also leads to the activation of the small G protein Rho. The activation of Rho by PAR-1 leads to the activation of the kinase ROCK. The activation of ROCK leads to the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. The activation of PAR-1 also leads to the activation of calcium signaling. The activation of PAR-1 also leads to the activation of PI3 kinase. The activation of PI3 kinase leads to the activation of the kinase Akt. The activation of Akt leads to the phosphorylation of the kinase PDK-1. PDK-1 in turn phosphorylates and activates Akt. The activation of Akt by PAR-1 is independent of PI3 kinase and is mediated by G alpha 1 3. The activation of Akt by PAR-1 may play a role in the anti-apoptotic effects of thrombin.",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen and survival factor for many cell types. IGF-1 signals through the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R), a receptor tyrosine kinase closely related in structure to the insulin receptor. IGF-1 stimulates proliferation of many cell types, including cells of neural origin. IGF-1 also protects cells from a variety of apoptotic stimuli. The IGF-1 / IGF-1R system is implicated in a number of pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative disease. IGF-1 and the IGF-1R are widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system. IGF-1 promotes neuronal survival and differentiation, and may function as a neurotrophic factor in the brain. IGF-1 also stimulates neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration. IGF-1 may play a role in learning and memory. IGF-1 expression is reduced in the aged brain, and IGF-1 treatment has been shown to reverse age-related learning deficits in rodents. The neuroprotective effects of IGF-1 may be mediated through inhibition of apoptosis.",
  "The immune system consists of two major classes of cells, the lymphocytes and the cells of the monocyte-macrophage series. The immune response is initiated by the interaction of antigen-presenting cells (APC) with specific receptors on the surface of T cells. The APC cells include macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells. The interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with the MHC-peptide complex on the APC cell surface is the key event in the activation of T cells. The APC cell surface also expresses a variety of costimulatory molecules that are required for T cell activation. The interaction of CD2 8 on T cells with its ligand on the APC cell surface provides one such costimulatory signal. The interaction of the CD4 coreceptor on T cells with MHC-peptide complex provides an additional costimulatory signal. The interaction of the CD52 coreceptor on the APC cell surface with the CTLA-4 coreceptor on the T cell provides an additional costimulatory signal. The activation of T cells leads to the production of cytokines and the proliferation of T cells. The activation of T cells also leads to the differentiation of T cells into Th cells or cytotoxic T cells. The interaction of the TCR with the MHC-peptide complex also leads to the induction of apoptosis in the T cell that does not interact with the APC cell. The interaction of CD2 8 with its ligand provides a costimulatory signal that blocks T cell apoptosis.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of secreted growth factors regulates a broad spectrum of cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and extracellular matrix production. TGF-beta family members signal through serine / threonine kinase receptors and intracellular SMAD proteins. The TGF-beta receptor complex includes type II and type I receptors. TGF-beta ligands bind to the type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor. The type I receptor phosphorylates receptor-activated SMADs (R-SMADs), including SMAD2 and SMAD3. R-SMADs associate with the co-SMAD SMAD4 and the complex is then translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the SMADs combine with DNA-binding proteins to regulate gene expression. TGF-beta signaling can be blocked by SMAD6 and SMAD7. SMAD6 and SMAD7 interact with the type I receptor and block R-SMAD phosphorylation and activation.",
  "The opioid peptides met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin are widely distributed in the CNS and act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. The actions of these peptides are mediated by three distinct opioid receptors, mu, delta, and kappa. The mu receptor is the target of morphine and other opiates, the delta receptor is the target of the endogenous peptides, and the kappa receptor is the target of the belladonna alkaloids like naloxone. The analgesic and other actions of the endogenous peptides are mediated by the mu receptor, while the dysphoric and other effects are mediated by the kappa receptor. The mu receptor is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the stimulation of K + channel activity. The delta receptor is also coupled to these two pathways, but is less efficacious in the activation of K + channels. The delta receptor also stimulates PLC, but this pathway does not appear to be involved in the physiological responses. The activation of the PLC pathway does result in the release of intracellular calcium, which may play a role in the physiological responses. The kappa receptor is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the stimulation of K + channel activity. In addition to these second messenger systems, the opioid receptors also interact with other signaling systems. The activation of the mu receptor leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinase pathway, including the kinases Erk-1 and Erk-2, and the downstream kinase, p38. The activation of this pathway appears to be mediated by Gi / o and the betagamma subunits of Gi. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway may play a role in some of the physiological responses to activation of the mu receptor. The delta receptor also leads to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, but this pathway appears to be mediated by Gs and the alpha subunit of Gs. The delta receptor also leads to the activation of the p38 pathway, but this pathway appears to be mediated by betagamma subunits released from Gi / o. The activation of p38 may play a role in some of the physiological responses to activation of the delta receptor. The kappa receptor also activates the MAP kinase pathway, but this pathway appears to be mediated by Gi / o and betagamma. The activation of the p38 pathway may play a role in some of the physiological responses to activation of the kappa receptor. The activation of the p38 pathway may play a role in some of the physiological responses to activation of the kappa receptor. The mu receptor also leads to the activation of the stress activated protein kinase, p38, but this pathway appears to be mediated by Gs and the alpha subunit of Gs. The p38 pathway may play a role in some of the physiological responses to activation of the mu receptor. The mu receptor also leads to the activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK, but this pathway appears to be mediated by Gi / o and betagamma. The JNK pathway may play a role in some of the physiological responses to activation of the mu receptor. The mu receptor also leads to the activation of the transcription factor AP-1, but this pathway appears to be mediated by Gi / o and the alpha subunit of Gs. The AP-1 pathway may play a role in some of the physiological responses to activation of the mu receptor.",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular communication mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in a variety of species. The Notch receptor is a single-pass transmembrane protein that is activated by interaction with a Delta or Jagged ligand on an adjacent cell. The Notch receptor is cleaved by a protease, Presenilin, and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released and translocates to the nucleus. There, the NICD interacts with the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF-1, Su (H), Lag1) and the coactivator MAML to activate transcription of Notch target genes. The Notch pathway is also involved in cell-fate decisions in the developing nervous system and is involved in cell-fate decisions in a variety of tissues in the adult. Notch signaling is also involved in the pathogenesis of several human cancers.",
  "The biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors is initiated by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI), which is catalyzed by PIG-N (also known as PIG-A). The second step in the pathway is the addition of a phosphoethanolamine (EthN) group to the GlcNAc-PI, which is catalyzed by PIG-P (also known as PIG-C). Ethanolamine is the third of the six monosaccharides that are conserved in all GPI precursors. The third EthN is deacetylated in the third step of the pathway to generate the first mannose in the GPI precursor. The fourth Methionine of the GPI precursor is also Methionine and is not EthN. The fifth Methionine of the precursor is acylated in the third step of the pathway. The sixth Methionine of the precursor is acylated in the third step of the pathway. The addition of the first mannose to the GPI precursor is the committed step in GPI biosynthesis. The first mannose is added by MPIase (also known as PIGM). After the addition of the first mannose, the precursor is deacylated and the GPI precursor is transported from the ER to the Golgi by the action of the p2 4 proteins. In the Golgi, the first mannose is modified by the addition of a phosphoethanolamine (EthN) group. The EthN is subsequently deacetylated in the third step of the pathway. The next mannose in the precursor is also modified by EthN. The next mannose is modified by the addition of a xylose and a glucose. The addition of the xylose is catalyzed by the transferase B4GalT1. The addition of the glucose is catalyzed by the transferase B3GalT1. The final steps of the biosynthesis of the GPI precursor are conserved from yeast to mammals. The first step in the modification of the first mannose is the addition of EthN by PIG-P (PIG-C). The next modification of the first mannose is the addition of xylose by B4GalT1. The next mannose is modified by the addition of glucose by B3GalT1. The addition of the third EthN is catalyzed by PIG-N (PIG-A). The enzymes that catalyze the remaining steps of the biosynthesis of the GPI precursor are still being identified.",
  "Histones are basic proteins that are highly conserved in evolution. They are essential for chromatin structure and function. They are found in the core histone complex, together with DNA, to form the nucleosome, the fundamental structural unit of chromatin. They are classified into two types: the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and the linker histone (H1). The core histones form a stable histone octamer around which DNA is wound in a left-handed superhelix, while the linker histone binds to the nucleosome to stabilize the higher-order chromatin structure. Histones are highly conserved in sequence and structure. They are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are subsequently transported into the nucleus. In addition to the histones, cells contain a group of proteins called histone chaperones that are involved in histone assembly, disassembly, and nucleosome stabilization.",
  "The G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) plays a key role in the desensitization and internalization of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In addition to this regulatory function, GRK2 has been implicated in other cellular processes such as cell cycle control and apoptosis. Here we show that GRK2 interacts with the small GTPase RhoA and that this interaction is involved in the regulation of RhoA-mediated signaling. GRK2 interacts with the active form of RhoA, but not with the inactive form. The interaction of GRK2 with RhoA leads to inhibition of the RhoA-mediated signaling pathways such as stress fiber formation and SRF activation. Furthermore, we found that GRK2 phosphorylates RhoA in vitro. These results suggest that GRK2 regulates RhoA-mediated signaling pathways through the interaction with RhoA and phosphorylation of RhoA. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > \u2583",
  "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that stimulates the growth and proliferation of T cells. The IL-2 receptor is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is responsible for high affinity ligand binding and the beta subunit is responsible for signal transduction. Binding of IL-2 to its receptor activates the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate the receptor and other substrates. Phosphorylated substrates activate the MAP kinase pathway and the STAT transcription factors. The MAP kinase pathway leads to activation of transcription factors such as ELK-1 and SRF and the STAT factors activate transcription of a number of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The Fas / APO-1 receptor is a member of the TNF receptor gene family. Binding of Fas-ligand (FasL) to Fas-receptor induces apoptosis in sensitive cells. This pathway is involved in the regulation of immune responses and may be involved in the development of autoimmune diseases and some forms of cancer. The Fas-induced apoptotic pathway is similar to that induced by the TNF receptor. Binding of Fas-ligand induces receptor aggregation and recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein. FADD in turn recruits pro-caspase-8 to the receptor complex. Caspase-8 activation then leads to cleavage and activation of downstream caspases and cleavage of Bid to tBid, which translocates to mitochondria to promote apoptosis.",
  "The estrogen receptor (ER) is a member of the nuclear receptor gene family. It functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. In the absence of ligand, ER is associated with a corepressor complex containing N-CoR and SMRT. Upon binding of estrogen, ER undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from the corepressor complex. The dissociated ER then forms a heterodimer with the 9 0-kDa heat shock protein (hsp-9 0) and is recruited to the estrogen response element (ERE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The activated ER complex interacts with other transcription factors, such as Sp1 and the p65 subunit of RNA polymerase II, to activate transcription. The activity of ER can also be regulated by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of ER by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) increases the transcriptional activity of ER. The phosphorylation of ER by CDKs and p34cdc2 also increases its transcriptional activity. The phosphorylation of ER by CDKs may play a role in the cell cycle-dependent regulation of ER activity.",
  "ErbB receptors are activated by members of the EGF family of growth factors. These ligands include EGF, TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, betacellulin and epiregulin. They are synthesized as transmembrane precursors that are proteolytically cleaved to release the soluble growth factor. The ErbB receptors consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. The receptors are organized as dimers, with the exception of ErbB-3, which is a monomer. The ErbB receptors can form both homodimers and heterodimers, and the preferred partners for dimerization are determined by the specific ErbB receptor with which it is associated. The receptors are activated by ligand-induced dimerization, which brings the intracellular kinase domains into proximity and allows transphosphorylation. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for other signaling molecules. The ErbB receptors are regulated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, and by the Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the activated receptors. The activation of the ErbB receptors leads to the activation of several signaling cascades, including the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAPK and the PI3K / AKT pathways. These pathways are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.",
  "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that regulates energy homeostasis by acting on the brain and other peripheral tissues. Leptin acts by binding to a receptor (Ob-Rb) that is coupled to the JAK / STAT signaling pathway. In addition to acting as an anorectic hormone, leptin also acts as a metabolic regulator. Leptin stimulates fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic stress-sensing enzyme that is activated by increases in AMP: ATP and / or ADP: ATP ratios. Leptin also stimulates fatty acid oxidation in liver by acting on AMPK in the hypothalamus. The activation of AMPK by leptin in skeletal muscle and liver is independent of the JAK / STAT pathway, and appears to be mediated by the protein kinase LKB1, a tumor suppressor that activates AMPK by phosphorylation. Leptin also stimulates glucose uptake and utilization in skeletal muscle by activating AMPK. The ability of leptin to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle may contribute to the weight-reducing effects of leptin. The ability of leptin to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle may also contribute to the anti-diabetic effects of leptin.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGFR can be activated by ligand-induced dimerization with other members of the ErbB family of receptors (EGFR / HER1, HER2 / neu, HER3 and HER4) or by homodimerization with itself. The binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces receptor dimerization, which results in the activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and the subsequent phosphorylation of intracellular substrates. The phosphorylation of ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 by the EGFR does not appear to have as important a role as the phosphorylation of other substrates in the mitogenic signaling pathway. The recruitment of signaling molecules leads to the activation of two major signaling cascades: the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI3-kinase) -Akt pathway. These signaling pathways ultimately result in cellular proliferation, differentiation and / or migration.",
  "The development of the melanocyte is regulated by a network of transcription factors. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) -Zip transcription factors, including MITF, TFAP2A, TFAP2B, and USF, are important regulators of this process. The transcription factor PAX3 is also essential for the development of the melanocyte lineage. Mutations in the PAX3 gene are associated with the human disease Splendore-Hoorn (or lozartan hair), which is characterized by a tuft of thin, redundant, coarse, and curly hair. The agouti gene encodes a 1 3 2 amino acid protein that is secreted by the hair follicle into the hair bulb, where it is thought to act as an inverse agonist of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R). Binding of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) to MC1R stimulates the synthesis of cAMP, which activates MITF and the transcription of genes involved in melanin production. The agouti protein antagonizes this effect by binding to the MC1HR and inhibiting cAMP production.",
  "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals through the IL-1 receptor. IL-1 is produced by macrophages in response to infection and can stimulate the production of other cytokines, such as TNF, from many cell types. TNF is a cytokine with a number of functions, including induction of fever and other responses to infection. IL-1 and TNF can also act as inflammatory agents in the absence of infection. The IL-1 receptor is a member of the TNF receptor family and signals through the TRAF family of proteins to activate NF-kB and other transcription factors.",
  "The interaction of B cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is essential for the generation of an effective immune response. The B cell receptor (BCR) is responsible for the recognition of antigen and the initiation of B cell activation. The BCR is a heterodimer consisting of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chains associated with the Ig-alpha (CD7 9a) and Ig-beta (CD7 9b) signaling subunits. The binding of antigen to the BCR initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the proliferation and differentiation of the B cell. The interaction of APCs with B cells also plays an important role in the generation of an effective immune response. The interaction of B cells with APCs is mediated by a variety of cell surface molecules, including the integrins LFA-1 (CD11a / CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b / CD18), the Ig-alpha / Ig-beta heterodimer, and CD4 0.",
  "The CD40 ligand (CD154) is expressed on activated T cells and binds to CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) gene family. The interaction of CD40 with CD154 induces B cell proliferation and differentiation and T cell activation.",
  "The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading microorganisms and is activated within a few hours of infection. The first line of defense is the activation of macrophages and neutrophils by microbial components such as LPS. Macrophages and neutrophils respond to LPS by secreting cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. These cytokines activate the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response, which is mediated by T cells and antibodies. The activation of the innate immune response by LPS is mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4 is a member of the Toll-like receptor family that recognizes bacterial LPS and activates the innate immune response. The activation of the innate immune response by LPS is a protective response, however, the inappropriate or excessive activation of the innate immune response can lead to septic shock, a syndrome caused by the over-exuberant inflammatory response to infection. The activation of the innate immune response by LPS is mediated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. In the absence of LPS, NF-kappaB is bound in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor I-kappaB. Upon LPS stimulation, I-kappaB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, releasing NF-kappaB to translocate into the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes containing NF-kappaB binding sites. The activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is mediated by the kinase IRAK-1, which is recruited to the TLR4 signaling complex by the adapter protein MyD8 8. IRAK-1 activates the kinase NIK (NF-kappaB inducing kinase), which activates the kinase Ik-beta, leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of I-kappaB. The activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is transient, and the activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is rapidly attenuated by the induction of I-kappaB and the feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by the cytokines IL-1 and IL-4. The transient activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is important for the rapid activation of the innate immune response and the subsequent attenuation of the response. The feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IL-1 and IL-4 is mediated by the transcription factor STAT3. The activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is transient due to the feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IL-1 and IL-4. The transient activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is important for the rapid activation of the innate immune response and the subsequent attenuation of the response. The transient activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is mediated by the feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IL-1 and IL-4. The feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IL-1 and IL-4 is mediated by STAT3. The transient activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is important for the rapid activation of the innate immune response and the subsequent attenuation of the response. The feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IL-1 and IL-4 is mediated by STAT3. The feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IL-1 and IL-4 is mediated by STAT3. The transient activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is important for the rapid activation of the innate immune response and the subsequent attenuation of the response. The feedback inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IL-1 and IL-4 is mediated by STAT3. The transient activation of NF-kappaB by LPS is important for the rapid activation of the innate immune response and the subsequent attenuation of the response.",
  "The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. It is activated by the vitamin A derivative retinoic acid (RA) and plays a role in a variety of developmental processes. The RAR is found in two forms, RAR alpha and RAR beta. The RAR alpha form is found in most adult tissues and is involved in the development of the central nervous system. The RAR beta form is found in the lung, skin, and male germ cells and is involved in the development of the lung and male germ cells. The RAR is a ligand-activated transcription factor. Upon binding RA, the RAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The RXR is a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family and forms a heterodimer with the RAR. The RAR / RXR heterodimer binds to DNA at a RA response element (RARE). The RAR / RXR heterodimer recruits coactivators that contain a domain with histone acetyltransferase activity. The coactivators are required for transcriptional activation by the RAR / RXR heterodimer. The corepressors also bind to the RAR / RXR heterodimer, but in the presence of RA they are released and the coactivators are recruited. The coactivators have histone acetyltransferase activity and are required for transcriptional activation by the RAR / RXR heterodimer. The coactivators also contain a Bromo domain that may be involved in chromatin remodeling. The corepressors also have a repression domain that interacts with the corepressor bound to the RAR / RXR heterodimer. The corepressors are released upon binding RA and the RAR / RXR heterodimer recruits corepressors to the promoter region of the RA-responsive genes. The corepressors also contain a deacetylase domain that may be involved in chromatin remodeling. The binding of coactivators and corepressors to the RAR / RXR heterodimer is dependent on the DNA sequence of the RARE. The RARE can be found as a direct repeat with a space of 1bp (DR1), a direct repeat with a space of 2bp (DR2), a palindrome with a space of 1bp (pal), or a direct repeat with a space of 2bp (DR5). The RAR / RXR heterodimer can also bind to an inverted repeat with a space of 1bp (IR1). The spacing between the half sites of the response elements can affect the affinity of the heterodimer for the different response elements. The RAR / RXR heterodimer can also bind to negative response elements (NREs). The NREs are found in the promoters of RA-responsive genes and bind the RAR / RXR heterodimer with lower affinity than a classical RARE. The NREs can be found as direct repeats with a space of 1bp (DR1), a direct repeat with a space of 2bp (DR2), or an inverted repeat with a space of 1bp (IR1). The NREs can also be found as inverted repeats with a space of 1bp (IR2). The NREs can repress transcription in the presence of RA, but can also activate transcription in the absence of RA. The ability of the RAR / RXR heterodimer to bind to different response elements may be responsible for the ability of RA to regulate a variety of genes.",
  "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key developmental process that is also activated during tumor progression to promote invasion and metastasis. During EMT, epithelial cells lose their cell-cell contacts and gain a mesenchymal phenotype. This process is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors, including the zinc finger proteins Snail and ZEB, and the basic helix-loop-helix protein Twist. These transcription factors repress expression of E-cadherin, a key component of epithelial cell-cell adhesion. Induction of EMT also results in the expression of mesenchymal genes, such as vimentin and N-cadherin. Secreted factors such as TGF-beta induce EMT through activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways. Secreted factors also induce the expression of transcription factors such as Snail and ZEB, which repress expression of E-cadherin and other epithelial genes, and activate the expression of mesenchymal genes. The transcription factors Snail, Twist and ZEB repress E-cadherin expression by binding to the E-box elements in the E-cadherin promoter. Other transcription factors such as the basic helix-loop-helix proteins Twist and Snail repress E-cadherin expression by different mechanisms. Snail represses E-cadherin expression by recruiting histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases to the E-cadherin promoter, resulting in a compact chromatin structure and transcriptional repression. Twist represses E-cadherin expression by binding to the E-box element in the E-cadherin promoter and recruiting the transcriptional corepressor mSin3A and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the promoter. Other factors such as the forkhead transcription factor FOXC2 repress E-cadherin expression by activating the expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail. The induction of EMT by TGF-beta also activates the expression of other transcription factors such as the SIP1 / ZEB2 and the deltaEF1 / ZEB1 zinc finger transcription factors. The deltaEF1 / ZEB1 factor represses expression of E-cadherin and other epithelial genes by recruiting histone deacetylases and other corepressors to the E-cadherin promoter. The induction of EMT by Ras signaling also involves the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The induction of EMT by Ras signaling also involves the activation of the transcription factor Twist. Twist represses E-cadherin expression by binding to the E-cadherin promoter and activating the expression of Snail. The induction of EMT by Ras signaling also involves the activation of the transcription factor FOXC2. Twist and FOXC2 repress E-cadherin expression by different mechanisms.",
  "The immune system is a complex network of cells that defends against infectious agents and tissues damage and repairs damaged tissues. To achieve these functions, the immune system has two main components: the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system consists of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). These cells provide the first line of defense against pathogens and provide early inflammatory responses. The adaptive immune system is comprised of B cells, T cells, and antibodies. Upon activation, T cells differentiate into effector cells that can kill infected cells and trigger the maturation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs then activate B cells to produce specific antibodies.",
  "The formation of a thrombus at the site of vascular injury is a complex process involving the interaction of platelets with the damaged vessel wall, the coagulation cascade, and the endothelium. The interaction of platelets with the damaged vessel wall leads to the exposure of subendothelial matrix proteins, which in turn stimulates the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex. The binding of vWF to GPIb-IX-V activates the integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (GPIIb-IIIa), which mediates platelet aggregation. The binding of vWF to GPIb-IX-V also stimulates the binding of fibrinogen to alpha IIb beta 3, which is required for stable platelet aggregation. The binding of fibrinogen to alpha IIb beta 3 is reinforced by the binding of additional fibrinogen to activated GPIb-IX-V, and also by the binding of additional vWF. The binding of vWF to GPIb-IX-V also stimulates phospholipase A2 activation, which in turn liberates arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. The released arachidonic acid is converted to the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) by the enzyme thromboxane synthase. TXA2 in turn activates the platelet phospholipase A2, further amplifying the formation of thromboxane A2. The binding of fibrinogen to alpha IIb beta 3 also activates phospholipase A2, which liberates additional arachidonic acid. The activation of phospholipase A2 is required for the formation of additional thromboxane A2, as well as for the formation of the other platelet agonists, ADP and serotonin. The activation of phospholipase A2 also leads to the activation of the protein kinase C pathway. The activation of protein kinase C leads to the phosphorylation of several proteins, including the myosin light chains, which in turn regulate platelet shape change and platelet aggregation. The binding of thrombin to its receptor on the platelet surface activates the protease-activated receptor PAR4. The activation of the protease-activated receptor PAR4 also leads to the activation of alpha IIb beta 3 and phospholipase A2. The binding of thrombin to its receptor also leads to the activation of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex, which may play a role in the initial activation of platelets.",
  "T cell activation requires two signals. The first signal is provided by the T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of the MHC-peptide complex, and the second is provided by costimulatory signals provided by the costimulatory receptor CD2 8 or by the interaction of the T cell receptor with costimulatory ligands like B7. The TCR activates multiple signaling pathways, including the calcium-calcineurin pathway, the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, and the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The calcium-calcineurin pathway leads to dephosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor NFAT, which induces the expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and other genes required for T cell activation. The PKC pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factors NF-AT and NF-kB, which induce the expression of other genes involved in T cell activation. The Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factor ELK-1, which induces the expression of other genes involved in T cell activation. The interaction of the T cell receptor with the costimulatory receptor CD2 8 or with its ligands provides a positive costimulatory signal that is required for T cell activation. The p21-activated kinase (PAK) is a downstream target of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc4 2, which are activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor vav. The activation of PAK by Rac and Cdc4 2 is required for T cell activation.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the major pathway for the repair of small DNA lesions such as alkylated or oxidized bases. It is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that recognizes the damaged base, cleaves the bond between the base and the deoxyribose phosphate, and releases the damaged base and an apurinic / apyrimidinic (AP) site. The AP site is then incised by an AP endonuclease, and the resulting single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) gap is filled by a DNA polymerase and then sealed by DNA ligase. The DNA glycosylases that initiate BER fall into two categories: those that remove only damaged bases (monofunctional DNA glycosylases) and those that remove both damaged bases and the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) group (bifunctional DNA glycosylases). Monofunctional DNA glycosylases are found in bacteria and some lower eukaryotes, whereas bifunctional DNA glycosylases are found in higher eukaryotes. Bifunctional DNA glycosylases have an N-terminal glycosylase domain and a C-terminal AP lyase domain. The glycosylase domain catalyzes the release of the damaged base, whereas the AP lyase domain cleaves the DNA strand at the AP site, generating a 3 '-phospho-alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde (PUA) residue and a 5' -phosphate. The dRP group is removed by the 5 '-phosphodiesterase activity of pol beta or by the 3' -phosphodiesterase activity of APE1. DNA ligase I or DNA ligase III (or possibly DNA ligase IV) then seals the DNA. The nth-like DNA glycosylase 1 (NEIL1) and NEIL2 are bifunctional DNA glycosylases that are distinct from the Escherichia coli Fpg and Nei proteins. They are localized in the nucleus and have a glycosylase domain and an AP lyase domain. They are involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage.",
  "The tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated in a variety of human cancers. The p53 protein is induced by DNA damage and regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis. The p53 gene product interacts with a variety of proteins to regulate cell growth and apoptosis. The p53 gene product interacts with the oncogene MDM2 to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis. The p53 gene product also interacts with the tumor suppressor gene p21 to regulate apoptosis. The p21 gene product is activated by DNA damage and interacts with the p53 gene product to induce apoptosis. The p53 gene product also interacts with the tumor suppressor gene p27 to regulate apoptosis. The p21 and p27 gene products interact to regulate cell growth.",
  "The actions of dopamine are mediated by five different receptor subtypes (D1-5). The D1-like receptors (D1 and D5) are coupled to the Golf heterotrimer and stimulate cAMP formation through activation of adenylate cyclase. The D2-like receptors (D2, D3 and D4) are coupled to the Gi protein and inhibit cAMP formation. The actions of dopamine are mediated by a variety of signal transduction systems including ion channels, protein kinases and phosphatases, and gene transcription.",
  "Insulin binding to its receptor activates the receptor tyrosine kinase and initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the uptake of glucose into the cell. This cascade begins with the binding of insulin to the receptor, followed by the activation of PI3-kinase, which phosphorylates membrane lipids to generate PIP3. PIP3 recruits AKT to the membrane, where it is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and p38. AKT phosphorylates and activates mTOR, which leads to the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and the stimulation of glucose uptake.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly conserved, fundamental biological process by which eukaryotic cells replicate and segregate their chromosomes for two daughter cells. The cell cycle is driven by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a family of serine / threonine protein kinases that are activated by binding to regulatory cyclin subunits. CDKs are required for the progression through each phase of the cell cycle. The activity of CDKs is regulated by the availability of cyclin subunits, the phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues, and the binding of inhibitory proteins. The G1-S transition is promoted by the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes. The activation of cyclin D-CDK4 / 6 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes triggers the G1-S progression. The activation of cyclin A-CDK2 complexes triggers the S-phase transition. The activation of cyclin B-CDK1 complexes triggers the G2-M transition and the progression through mitosis. The activation of the checkpoint at the G2-M phase transition allows cells time to repair damaged DNA before progressing through mitosis. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a surveillance mechanism that ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation by delaying the onset of anaphase until all kinetochores are attached to microtubules from opposite poles (bivalencies). The SAC is activated by unattached kinetochores and inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin B and other mitotic regulators for proteolytic degradation.",
  "The adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium is a key step in the inflammatory response. The interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium is mediated by a family of adhesion molecules, the integrins. The leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (CD1 1b / CD1 8) binds to its endothelial counter receptors ICAM-1 (CD5 4) and ICAM-2 (CD3 1). The interaction of Mac-1 with ICAM-1 is involved in the firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and their subsequent migration into tissues. The interaction of Mac-1 with ICAM-2 appears to be involved in the regulation of leukocyte activation. The interaction of Mac-1 with its endothelial ligands is regulated in part by the leukocyte protease elastase. Mac-1 is also the receptor for the complement fragment iC3b. The interaction of Mac-1 with iC3b is involved in the phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria by macrophages. The interaction of Mac-1 with its endothelial ligands and iC3b is inhibited by the serum protein alpha 1-antichymotrypsin.",
  "The Rho family of GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, are molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Rho-GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote the release of bound GDP and the binding of GTP. GAPs stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho-GTPases, promoting the conversion of the active GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind to Rho-GTPases and maintain them in the inactive state in the cytosol. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are the only known regulators of Rho-GTPases and are classified into four subfamilies on the basis of their sequence homology: Dbl-homology (DH) domain family, the Vav family, the Map kinase kinase family and the PSD-9 5 / Dlg-5c10 (PSD) -occludens (ZO) (PDZ) domain family. GEFs are activated by upstream signals and stimulate the release of bound GDP and the binding of GTP on Rho-GTPases. GAPs stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho-GTPases, returning them to the inactive GDP-bound state. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) maintain Rho-GTPases in the inactive state in the cytosol by binding to the isoprenyl group of Rho-GTPases. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) also block the interaction of Rho-GTPases with their upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are themselves regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including the release of inhibitory interactions, protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation and the relief of inhibitory lipid membrane interactions. Activated Rho-GTPases interact with a variety of downstream targets to transduce signals to various cellular responses. Specific effectors couple Rho-GTPases to particular cellular responses. For example, RhoA activates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions through the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and p160ROCK. The Rac1-activated kinase Pak1 stimulates lamellopodial extension through the phosphorylation of the 319regulatory light chain of myosin II. The role of Cdc42 in cellular responses is less clear, but Cdc42 may regulate the formation of filopodia through the phosphorylation of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and the Arp2 / 3 complex.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily includes cell-surface receptors that induce apoptosis when bound by their ligands. The Fas receptor (also called APO1, CD9 5, and TNFRSF6) is activated by Fas ligand (also called APO1, CD9 5L, and TNFSF6) to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types. Binding of Fas ligand to Fas induces aggregation of the Fas receptor and the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to the receptor. FADD then recruits caspase-8 (also called MACH and Mch5), a protease that is normally present in the cytosol in an inactive form. FADD and caspase-8 then associate at the receptor to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DISC formation leads to the activation of caspase-8, which in turn activates downstream caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and-7. The Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis by controlling the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent the release of mitochondrial factors such as cytochrome c that induce the caspase cascade. Interaction of Bid, a Bcl-2 family protein, with Bax causes the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, where it causes the release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 to activate caspase-9, the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit this mitochondrial pathway by blocking the release of cytochrome c.",
  "The CCR4-NOT complex is a highly conserved multi-subunit complex from yeast to human that plays a key role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by means of deadenylation, histone modification, and mRNA decay. The CCR4-NOT complex consists of at least two functional subcomplexes, a core complex consisting of nine subunits (NOT1-9) and a regulatory complex consisting of CAF1 / 2, BTG1 / 2, and CNOT1-3. The core complex possesses a deadenylase activity, which is stimulated by CAF1 / 2, and a histone acetyltransferase activity, which is stimulated by BTG / BTG2.The CCR4-NOT complex also interacts with transcription factors and coactivators to regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level.",
  "PDGF is a potent mitogen that stimulates the proliferation of a variety of cell types. The cellular response to PDGF is mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases, PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta. These receptors are structurally similar, but differ in their expression patterns and downstream signaling pathways. The major difference between the two receptors is that PDGFR-beta signals through the Ras-Map kinase pathway, while PDGFR-alpha signals through the p130 pathway. The Ras-Map kinase pathway leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor ELK-1, which in turn activates the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and transformation.",
  "Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically controlled process that plays an important role in development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. It is characterized by condensation of chromatin, fragmentation of chromatin into nucleosomal ladders, and membrane blebbing. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are cleaved and activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases in turn activate other proteases that cause cellular disassembly. Caspases-8 and caspase-3 are activated by the Fas receptor and other members of the TNF receptor family. Caspase-8 is an upstream protease that cleaves caspase-3 and other caspases. Caspase-3 is an effector protease that directly cleaves cellular substrates, including the nuclear lamins that maintain the structural integrity of the cell. Caspase-6 and caspase-7 are also effector caspases that are activated by caspase-3. Other proteases involved in apoptosis include the Bcl-2 family of proteins and the DNA fragmentation factor (DFF). Caspases are inhibited by the IAP family of proteins that includes XIAP, NAIP, and survivin. Bcl-2 and Bax inhibit and Bid promotes apoptosis. The IAP proteins directly bind and inhibit caspase activity. The IAP proteins also interact with the TNF receptor associated factors TRAF2 and FADD to regulate apoptosis induced by the TNF receptor family.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is responsible for recognizing foreign antigen in the context of MHC II and triggering T cell activation. The TCR is a multi-subunit complex consisting of a heterodimer of alpha and beta chains associated with the CD3 complex (gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta) and the CD4 or CD8T cell coreceptor. The CD3 complex contains four subunits (gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta) and is responsible for transducing the activation signal from the TCR to the cytoplasm. The CD4 coreceptor binds to the MHC II molecule and is involved in the recognition of the antigen-MHC II complex. The activation of T cells is accompanied by entry of the cell into the cell cycle and the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) activating kinase (p34 cdc2). The activity of p34 cdc2 is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and by association with the cdk inhibitors, p16in4 and p19Ink4d. The activity of p34 cdc2 is required for the G1 to S phase transition and the cdc25p16ink4d pathway is required for the G1 to S phase transition. The activity of p34 cdc2 is regulated by the cell cycle and by the association with the cyclin subunits. The activity of p34 cdc2 is inhibited by association with the cdk inhibitors p16in4 and p19Ink4d. The activity of p34 cdc2 is also regulated by association with the cyclin subunits. The cyclin subunits are expressed constitutively throughout the cell cycle and are required for the activity of p34 cdc2. The activity of the cyclin subunits is regulated by association with the cdk inhibitors and by phosphorylation. The activity of the cyclin subunits is also regulated by association with the cdk inhibitors. The activity of the cyclin subunits is also regulated by phosphorylation. The activity of the cdk inhibitors is regulated by phosphorylation and by association with the cyclin subunits.",
  "The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway is a key mechanism for cellular communication. GPCRs are cell surface receptors that respond to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including neurotransmitters, hormones, odorants, taste ligands, light, and lipids. GPCRs transmit signals to intracellular G proteins, which in turn activate downstream effectors to produce cellular responses. The G protein is a heterotrimer composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The alpha subunit is the GPCR-regulated subunit and is responsible for the activation of downstream effectors. The beta and gamma subunits are involved in the regulation of the G protein and GPCR signaling. The regulation of GPCR signaling occurs at many levels in the pathway. The receptor is the major point of regulation and can be regulated by phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization. The G protein is also a point of regulation and can be regulated by the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. RGS proteins are GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate the inactivation of G protein signaling. The beta gamma subunits can also regulate G protein signaling. The downstream effectors are the ion channels and the second messenger systems. The second messenger systems include the cAMP / PKA pathway and the calcium pathway. The cAMP / PKA pathway is involved in the regulation of ion channels and the calcium pathway is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes.",
  "Cyclin B / CDK1 (CDC2) is a key regulator of the cell cycle and its activation is required for the G2 / M transition. The activity of CDC2 is regulated by association with cyclin B. The activity of CDC2 / cyclin B is inhibited by phosphorylation of CDC2 on threonine-14and tyrosine-15by Myt1 and 5by p27. The activation of CDC2 / cyclin B is associated with the dephosphorylation of these residues by CDC2 5C. The localization of CDC2 5C is regulated by phosphorylation on multiple sites. Phosphorylation of CDC2 5C on serine-21creates a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins that retain CDC2 5C in the cytoplasm. Dephosphorylation of serine-21allows CDC2 5C to move into the nucleus and activate CDC2 / cyclin B. The activation of CDC2 / cyclin B is opposed by the Wee-1 kinase and the p27 inhibitor proteins. The activation of Wee-1 is associated with the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-123 and the activation of p27 is associated with the dephosphorylation of threonine-14and tyrosine-15. p27 also inhibits CDC2 / cyclin B by blocking the activation of CDC2. The activation of p27 is opposed by the KAP phosphatase that dephosphorylates threonine-14and tyrosine-15and the protein phosphatase 2C that dephosphorylates threonine-14and dephosphorylates tyrosine-15and serine-19 and threonine-5of p27. The KAP phosphatase is activated by the phosphorylation of serine-8and serine-20KAP is activated by the phosphorylation of threonine-5and serine-20KAP is inhibited by the p90 protein kinase.",
  "The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily includes receptors for a wide variety of extracellular stimuli, including hormones, neurotransmitters, light, odorants, and pheromones. GPCRs are coupled to intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The alpha subunit of the G protein can interact with and regulate downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and ion channels. The beta gamma subunits can interact with and activate the MAP kinase cascade. The beta-arrestins are a family of four proteins that bind to agonist-activated GPCRs and block further receptor-G-protein coupling. In addition, beta-arrestins can couple receptors to the activation of the MAP kinase cascade. The beta-arrestins are also involved in receptor internalization and downregulation. The second messenger pathways and the MAP kinase cascade are involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. The activity of many GPCRs is also regulated by receptor kinases (GRKs) that phosphorylate the receptor to create a binding site for beta-arrestins.

  "The conversion of inactive steroid hormones into active steroid hormones is catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs). The human HSD family consists of 1 4 members, which are classified into three major groups based on their sequence similarity and substrate specificity: 1--3 (estrone > estradiol > testosterone > dihydrotestosterone), 1--2 (dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) > 5-androstenediol > 5-androstenediol), and 1--3 (corticosterone > cortisol > cortisone). 1--3 HSDs catalyze the interconversion between active and inactive steroid hormones and are involved in the biosynthesis of sex steroids from cholesterol, DHEA and cortisone in the adrenal gland and testosterone and estradiol in the testes and adrenal glands. 1--3 HSD catalyzes the reduction of the ketone group at the C1 7 position of the steroid ring to a hydroxyl group, whereas 1--2 HSDs catalyze the reverse reaction. 1--3 HSD catalyzes the reduction of estrone, estradiol, and testosterone to their corresponding inactive forms, whereas 1--2 HSDs catalyze the oxidation of these steroid hormones to regenerate the ketone groups. 1--3 HSD is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular weight of 3 4kDa, whereas 1--2 and 1--3 HSDs are dimeric enzymes with molecular weights of approximately 6 0kDa. 1--3 HSD is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family, which is characterized by their ability to reduce or oxidize a variety of aldehydes, ketones, and aldoses using a nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD (+)) or nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP (+)) cofactor. 1--3 HSD is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase / reductase (SDR) family, which is characterized by their sequence similarity and a conserved YXXXK motif. 1--3 HSD catalyzes the reversible NADP (+) -dependent reduction of estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) to their respective inactive 4-ene-3-ketosteroids, whereas 1--3 reductase catalyzes the NADP (+) -dependent oxidation of these steroids to regenerate the ketone groups. 1--3 reductase is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family, which is characterized by their sequence similarity and a conserved YXXXK motif.",
  "Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an important regulator of growth and development.

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor that is activated by the binding of ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EGFR is frequently over-expressed in human cancers and its expression is often associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a poorer prognosis. The EGFR is a member of a family of closely related tyrosine kinase receptors that also include the neu / HER2, HER3 and HER4 receptors. Binding of ligand to the EGFR leads to receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the ras-raf-MEK-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways. These pathways ultimately result in cellular proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis and enhanced cell motility and metastasis.",
  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a serine / threonine kinase that is activated by the second messenger cAMP. In mammals, there are two genes that encode the regulatory subunits of PKA, RIalpha and RIIalpha. The two PKA regulatory subunits are highly similar in sequence and structure, and are expressed in different tissues. The RIIalpha regulatory subunit is highly expressed in brain, while the RIalpha regulatory subunit is expressed in most tissues. The PKA catalytic subunit is encoded by a single gene that is expressed as two isoforms, C\u03b1 and PKCIbeta, that are expressed in different tissues. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of a dimer of regulatory subunits and two dimers of catalytic subunits. The regulatory subunits are encoded by two genes, PRKACA and PRKACB. The PKA holoenzyme is inactive in the absence of cAMP and is activated by the binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits, releasing the catalytic subunits to phosphorylate downstream targets. The release of the catalytic subunits is transient and the regulatory subunits deactivate and re-bind to cAMP to reform the inactive PKA holoenzyme. The PKA regulatory subunits are encoded by two genes, PRKACB and PRKACG. The PKA catalytic subunits are encoded by a single gene, PRKACA. The PKA catalytic subunits are encoded by two genes, PRKACA1 and PRKACA2. The PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits are expressed differently in different tissues.",
  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Although the etiology of PD is still unknown, genetic studies have identified several causative genes, including alpha-synuclein, parkin, PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1), and DJ-1. These genes are involved in diverse cellular functions, such as mitochondrial quality control, oxidative stress response, and protein handling. Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly fuse and divide to adapt to their environment. The mitochondrial fusion process is mediated by mitofusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), whereas the mitochondrial fission process is mediated by Drp1 and Fis1. The proper maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is essential for cell survival. However, when mitochondria are damaged, they are eliminated by a process known as mitophagy. Parkin, PINK1, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are involved in this process. In normal conditions, Parkin is recruited from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria in a PINK1-dependent manner. Parkin subsequently mediates ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins, which in turn leads to their degradation by the UPS. The UPS is impaired in PD patients with parkin mutations, which may result in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and the subsequent DA neuronal death.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a highly conserved signaling module involved in the transduction of extracellular signals to intracellular targets. The pathway is comprised of a three-tiered kinase cascade, with Raf being the MAPKKK at the top of the cascade. The MAPKKK phosphorylates and activates the MAPKKs, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the MAPKs. The MAPKs are a family of kinases involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The MAPKs are classified into three groups based on their structure and function: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p3 8 kinases. The Raf-1 kinase is the MAPKKK in the ERK pathway, and is activated by the small G-protein Ras. The MAPKKs include MEK1 and MEK2, which activate ERK1 and ERK2, and MKK3 and MKK6, which activate the JNK and p3 8 kinases. The MKK3 and MKK6 kinases are activated by the MAPKKK ASK1, which is activated by the transforming MAPKKK, Tpl-2. The JNKs are activated by the MAPKKK MEKK1, and the MAPKK SEK1, which is activated by the MAPKKK ASK1. The ERK5 kinase is activated by MEK5, which is activated by the MAPKKK MEK4. The ERK5 kinase is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Crosstalk occurs between the different MAPK pathways, and the activation of one pathway can inhibit the other. For example, activation of the JNK pathway can inhibit the ERK pathway by blocking the activation of Raf1.",
  "Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Glutamate acts at ionotropic (AMPA, NMDA, and kainate) and metabotropic (mGlu1-8) receptors. At the ionotropic glutamate receptors, glutamate binds to ligand-gated ion channels (iGluRs), which are tetramers of GluR1-4 subunits. NMDA receptors are cation channels that are activated by glutamate and blocked by Mg2 + ions. The binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor relieves the Mg2 + block, allowing Ca2 + influx. The glutamate-induced influx of Ca2 + into the cell triggers a variety of cellular responses, including the activation of protein kinases and phospholipases. At metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), glutamate acts on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). mGluRs are divided into three groups on the basis of their sequence homology, pharmacological properties, and effector coupling. Group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and 5) are coupled to Gq / 1 1 proteins and activate phospholipase C (PLC). Group II mGluRs (mGluR2 and 3) and group III mGluRs (mGluR4, 6, 7, and 8) are negatively coupled to cAMP formation through Gi / o proteins. The activation of PLC results in IP3 production, which stimulates release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activates protein kinase C (PKC). In addition, activation of Gq / 1 1 leads to the activation of the small G protein Rho and its effector kinase, Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK). Rho and ROCK subsequently activate a kinase cascade involving the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and subsequent stimulation of the formation of contractile actin-myosin filaments. The activation of PKC also contributes to the regulation of MLC phosphorylation through the inhibition of myosin phosphatase (MP). The activation of mGluRs also leads to the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs. The activation of these kinases contributes to the regulation of gene expression and other cellular responses.",
  "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Molecular analysis has identified several distinct groups of AML based on their genetic abnormalities. These groups include those with translocations involving RUNX1 (also known as AML1), such as t (8; 2 1) (AML-M2), t (1 5; 1 7) (AML-M3), and inv (AML-M4Eo), those with mutations in NPM1 (AML-M4eo), those with mutations in C / EBP\u03b1 (AML-M3v), and those with abnormalities of KIT (AML-mast). These molecular abnormalities affect various cellular functions, such as transcription, cell differentiation, signaling, and apoptosis.",
  "The heat shock protein Hsp70 (Hsp7 0) is a molecular chaperone that is induced by a variety of cellular stresses, including heat, heavy metals, and oxidative stress. Hsp70 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including Fas, TNF-alpha, and heat. The anti-apoptotic activity of Hsp70 is dependent on the ability of Hsp70 to bind to and stabilize the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. In addition, Hsp70 can inhibit apoptosis by blocking the Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation pathway. The ability of Hsp70 to inhibit apoptosis is dependent on its phosphorylation state. When Hsp70 is phosphorylated, it inhibits apoptosis, but dephosphorylation of Hsp70 allows apoptosis to proceed. The phosphorylation of Hsp70 is regulated by the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) / Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the protein kinase AKT. The phosphorylation of Hsp70 by the SAPK / JNK pathway is stimulated by TNF and inhibits apoptosis, while the phosphorylation of Hsp70 by AKT inhibits apoptosis and is stimulated by growth factors. The inhibition of apoptosis by Hsp70 is also dependent on the presence of the co-chaperone AIF (apoptosis inducing factor). AIF is a mitochondrial protein that translocates to the nucleus to induce chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation in a caspase-independent manner. Hsp70 binds to AIF and prevents it from entering the nucleus. The inhibition of apoptosis by Hsp70 is also dependent on the presence of the co-chaperone p40 0. Hsp70 and p40 0 form a complex that binds to AIF and prevents it from entering the nucleus. The ability of Hsp70 to inhibit apoptosis is dependent on the presence of Hsp70 in the mitochondria. In the absence of Hsp70, AIF is released from the mitochondria and induces apoptosis.",
  "Leukocyte trafficking from the bloodstream into tissues is a key component of the inflammatory response. During inflammation, endothelial cells in the walls of blood vessels express chemokines that attract leukocytes to the site of inflammation. The first step in the recruitment of leukocytes into inflamed tissues is their tethering and rolling on the vascular endothelium. This is mediated by the interaction of selectins on the leukocyte surface with their ligands on the endothelial cells. The rolling step is followed by activation of integrins on the leukocyte surface, which bind their ligands on the endothelial cells. The leukocytes then firmly adhere to the endothelium and extravasate into the inflamed tissue. The rolling and adhesion of leukocytes is a dynamic process, with the leukocytes constantly undergoing rolling along the endothelial cells, and the rolling velocity is determined by the strength of the interaction between the selectins and their ligands. The interaction of selectins with their ligands is regulated by the addition and removal of carbohydrates from the ligands by glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. The addition of carbohydrates to selectin ligands is catalyzed by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). The removal of carbohydrates is catalyzed by the enzyme O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Inhibition of OGT or activation of OGA blocks selectin-mediated rolling and leukocyte trafficking. Inhibition of OGT also blocks the recruitment of leukocytes into inflamed tissues in vivo. The addition of carbohydrates to selectin ligands is a dynamic process, and is regulated by the expression of the glycosyltransferases and glycosidases that modify the selectin ligands. The addition of carbohydrates by OGT is reversible, and the removal of carbohydrates by OGA is also a reversible process. The addition of carbohydrates by OGT is required for selectin ligand activity, and the removal of carbohydrates by OGA is required for selectin ligand inactivation. The addition and removal of carbohydrates by OGT and OGA is a dynamic process that regulates the activity of selectin ligands and thus the rolling and adhesion of leukocytes.",
  "Transcription of rRNA genes by RNA polymerase I is the rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis and accounts for up to 6 0% of all nuclear transcription. RNA polymerase I is a multi-subunit enzyme consisting of 1 4 subunits, and its activity is regulated by a number of factors. The transcription factor UBF binds to the core promoter and upstream control region of the rRNA genes and recruits the SL1 complex to the promoter. The SL1 complex is formed by TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The activity of UBF is regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation. Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) -cyclin complexes phosphorylate UBF at CDK consensus sites, and this increases the affinity of UBF for the rRNA promoter. The histone acetylase PCAF interacts with UBF and stimulates its activity. The tumor suppressor p53 interacts with PCAF and inhibits its histone acetylase activity, thus repressing rRNA transcription. The tumor suppressor RB interacts with PCAF and represses rRNA transcription by blocking the interaction of PCAF with UBF. The T-box transcription factor TBX2 represses rRNA transcription by interacting with PCAF and blocking its histone acetylase activity. The Myb transcription factor c-Myb activates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and stimulates rRNA transcription. The interaction of c-Myb with PCAF is blocked by the coactivator CBP, which represses rRNA transcription. The interaction of c-Myb with PCAF is also blocked by p53, which represses rRNA transcription. The interaction of T-box transcription factor 2 (TBX2) with PCAF represses rRNA transcription. The interaction of Twist with PCAF represses rRNA transcription. Twist is a basic helix-lop helix transcription factor that plays an important role in development.",
  "The FA pathway is required for the repair of DNA damage induced by crosslinking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. Cells from patients with a defective FA pathway are extremely sensitive to crosslinking agents and are genetically unstable. The FA proteins cooperate in a common pathway that includes at least eight complementation groups (A, B, C, E, F, G and L). In the pathway, the FA-A protein binds to the FA-B, -C, -E, -F, and -G proteins to form a nuclear complex. The complex is required for the ubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein by the FA-C, -E, -F, and -G proteins in response to DNA damage. The ubiquitinated FANCD2 protein associates with BRCA2 and other proteins in chromatin to form nuclear foci that are thought to be involved in DNA repair. The checkpoint kinase ATR is also required for the ubiquitination of FANCD2 in response to DNA damage, but does not appear to be required for the formation of the nuclear foci. The checkpoint kinase ATM is also required for the ubiquitination of FANCD2 in response to DNA damage, but is not required for the formation of the nuclear foci. The checkpoint kinase ATR is also required for the ubiquitination of FANCD2 in response to DNA damage, but does not appear to be required for the formation of the nuclear foci. The checkpoint kinase ATM is also required for the ubiquitination of FANCD2 in response to DNA damage, but is not required for the formation of the nuclear foci. The checkpoint clamp complex RAD1 7-RAD4-ATAD5 is also required for the ubiquitination of FANCD2 in response to DNA damage, but does not appear to be required for the formation of the nuclear foci. The RAD1 7-RAD4-ATAD5 complex loads the 9-1-1 complex at sites of DNA damage to signal the presence of DNA damage. The checkpoint clamp loader RAD1 7-RAD4-ATAD5 complex may recruit the FA complex to the site of DNA damage, where the FA complex activates the ubiquitination of FANCD2 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex consisting of the FANCL, B, C, E, and G proteins. The ubiquitinated FANCD2 protein associates with BRCA2 and other proteins in chromatin to form nuclear foci that are involved in DNA repair. The removal of the ubiquitin groups from FANCD2 by the deubiquitinating enzyme UAF1 / USP2L3 may be required for the release of the repaired DNA from the repair complex.",
  "Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated polysaccharide of glucuronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine. Chondroitin sulfate chains are attached to core proteins to form proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate starts with the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine-glucuronic acid disaccharide repeat unit to a serine residue of a core protein by the enzyme, chondroitin synthase. After the assembly of the disaccharide repeat unit, various modifications occur. The first modification is the addition of a sulfate group to position 6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine. This modification is catalyzed by the enzyme, chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase. The second modification is the addition of a sulfate group to position 4 of the glucuronic acid. This modification is catalyzed by the enzyme, chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. The third modification is the epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid. This modification is catalyzed by the enzyme, uronyl 2-sulfotransferase. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are found in a number of tissues, including cartilage, brain, and the eye. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell adhesion, cell-cell communication, and embryonic development.",
  "Apoptosis or programmed cell death plays an important role in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Defects in the regulation of apoptosis can lead to the development of various diseases, including cancer. The execution of apoptosis is carried out by a family of proteases known as caspases. The activation of caspases results in the cleavage of a number of cellular proteins that are important for maintaining cellular structure and function. In this section, we will discuss the different pathways that activate caspases and the role of caspases in apoptosis."
