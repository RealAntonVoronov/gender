Inositol-1-phosphate receptors are intracellular receptors for the second messenger IP3 and the PKC activator DAG. They are widespread in animal cells and play a crucial role in many essential functions, including cell motility, differentiation and proliferation. There are three subtypes of inositol-1-phosphate receptors, ITPR1, ITPR2 and ITPR3, which are differentially expressed in different tissues.
Hyperglycemia is a key factor that contributes to the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Although there is little doubt as to the importance of hyperglycemia, there is considerable evidence that genetic factors also play a crucial role. Genetic studies have identified several candidate genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. These genes include: aldose reductase (AR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE).
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2 + signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3. As a result, mHtt enhances the sensitivity of InsP3R1 to InsP3, stimulating intracellular Ca2 + release. As a result, mHtt leads to supranormal Ca2 + responses to InsP3, which may result in mitochondrial Ca2 + overload and neuronal death.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation is a crucial step for maintaining brain homeostasis and for protecting the brain from harmful compounds. During development, neurons extend their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of tight junctions between neurons (adherens junctions) and between neurons and supporting cells (tight junctions). In addition, specialized glial cells, namely, tanycytes and radial glial cells, play essential roles in BBB formation. Various proteins and genes are involved in this process.
Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of chronic disorders that primarily affect the elderly population. They are characterized by progressive loss of neurons and their synapses, leading to serious disability and death. There are four major classes of neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Each of these diseases is associated with a different set of genetic mutations. For example, in AD, mutations are found in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2), which are involved in the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, the major component of senile plaques. In PD, mutations are found in alpha-synuclein, parkin, UCHL1 (a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1) and PINK1 (a putative serine threonine kinase), which are involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination and degradation. In HD summarize: In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), mutations are found in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species.
Heat shock proteins are a highly conserved group of proteins that are found in all organisms and that play a crucial role in cellular homeostasis. They are involved in various cellular functions such as protein folding, stabilization of unfolding proteins, prevention of protein aggregation, regulation of gene expression, and apoptosis. There are four major groups: small heat shock proteins (sHsps), medium heat shock proteins (mHsps), large heat shock proteins (lHsps), and testis-specific heat shock proteins (tHsps). sHsps are expressed at low levels under normal conditions, and they are upregulated in response to stress. They form dimers or oligomers and bind to unfolded proteins. MHsps are found in high levels in muscle and are involved in the formation of cytoskeletal structures and mitochondria. Hsp70 are found in high levels in the testis and are involved in the protection of sperm cells from damage by heat and oxidative stress.
Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are essential for neuromuscular signaling and are composed of three major components, the presynaptic membrane, the synaptic vesicle, and the postsynaptic membrane. Neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic membrane is regulated by various factors including Ca2 + channels, synaptic vesicles, and postsynaptic receptors. Upon activation of a synaptic membrane receptor, Ca2 + influx through voltage-dependent channels (VDCCs) and / or receptor-operated channels (ROCs) triggers the release of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are transported back to the presynaptic membrane by specific transporters. Once released, neurotransmitters diffuse into the synaptic vesicle lumen, where they are recognized and bound by specific transporters. The synaptic vesicle membrane contains various proteins essential for synaptic vesicle formation, endocytosis, and exocytosis. These proteins are synthesized in the ER and transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are modified by addition of sugars, lipids, and proteins. They are then sorted into synaptic vesicles by vesicular transport.
Huntington disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2 + signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3. As a result, mHtt promotes supranormal Ca2 + responses to InsP3, which may result in mitochondrial Ca2 + overload and neuronal death.

Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells serving as the cell's main digestive compartment to which all sorts of macromolecules are delivered for degradation. They contain more than 40 hydrolases in an acidic environment (pH of about 5). After synthesis in the ER, lysosomal enzymes are decorated with mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network. They are packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to late endosomes. Substances for digestion are acquired by the lysosomes via a series of processes including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.
Sarcomatous neoplasms of the heart are rare and account for < 1% of all cardiac neoplasms. They are classified into two groups: primary and secondary. Primary cardiac sarcomas (PCS) arise from the cardiac muscle itself, whereas secondary cardiac sarcomas (SCS) arise from adjacent tissues, such as the lung and pleura. Primary cardiac sarcomas are histologically classified into three major types: angiosarcoma, undifferentiated carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Small cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma are also included in the undifferentiated carcinoma. There is no consensus regarding the treatment of primary cardiac sarcomas.
Small GTPases of the Rho family are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton and cellular transformation. They are activated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and repressed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). They transmit signals by interacting with a variety of downstream effectors. Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. They are formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins.
Myocarditis is a cardiac disease associated with inflammation and injury of the myocardium. It results from various etiologies, both noninfectious and infectious, but coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is still considered the dominant etiological agent. Myocarditis may be caused by direct cytopathic effects of virus, a pathologic immune response to persistent virus, or autoimmunity triggered by the viral infection. The virus enters the myocyte through internalization of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) and its coreceptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Viral proteases cleave various proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to apoptosis. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells. CVB infection is a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well as myocarditis. Epidemiologically, myocarditis underlies a significant portion of patients with DCM.

Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.
Male infertility is a heterogeneous disorder that is caused by defects in either the male gonad or the sperm cells. In males, the testis is the major site of steroid hormone biosynthesis and it produces testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Infertility can be caused by defects in either the testis or the sperm cells. Testis disorders are classified into two major groups: disorders of spermatogenesis and disorders of testosterone biosynthesis. Disorders of spermatogenesis include spermatogenic arrest and obstructive azoospermia. During spermatogenesis, spermatogenic cells undergo a series of maturation steps from spermatogonia to spermatozoa. Spermatids undergo spermiogenesis, which is a highly coordinated process that includes chromatin condensation, membrane remodeling, and flagellar formation. Infertility due to testosterone deficiency is associated with defects in the hypothalamus and / or the pituitary gland.
Sideroblastic anemia are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a selective reduction in the number of red blood cells (RBCs). They are classified into two major categories: beta-thalassemia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene, which result in a decrease in the synthesis of hemoglobin (Hb). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia is caused by defects in the differentiation of erythroblasts.
Male infertility is a heterogeneous disorder that is caused by defects in either the egg and / or the sperm. Most of these defects are due to genetic defects in the sperm. Infertile men may have abnormal sperm numbers (oligozoospermia), abnormal sperm motility (asthenozoospermia), or both. Some of the genetic defects are due to mutations in genes that are essential for normal sperm formation and / or function. These genes include TP63, DPY1 92, and AKAP4.
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt).

In addition, mHtt affects Ca2 + signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3. As a result, mHtt enhances the sensitivity of InsP3R1 to InsP3, stimulating intracellular Ca2 + release. This abnormal Ca2 + signaling may lead to supranormal levels of intracellular Ca2 + that are detrimental to neurons.
Siderotic syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by a progressive accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the renal interstitium and progressive renal failure. There are two types of hereditary Siderotic syndrome: familial and sporadic. Familial Siderotic syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disorder, which is caused by mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) or hairless (HR) gene. The clinical features of familial Siderotic syndrome are similar to those of sporadic Siderotic syndrome.
Specific groups of viruses kill host cells by various mechanisms. Non-enveloped viruses penetrate the plasma membrane of cells and release their genetic materials in the cytoplasm. enveloped viruses enter cells by either receptor-mediated endocytosis or membrane fusion. In both cases, the viral genomes are released into the cytoplasm. Poliovirus enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the viral proteases cleave the host cell proteins essential for viral replication. The host cell membrane is disrupted by SARS coronavirus. The viral proteases cleave the transmembrane proteins of host cells. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the viral proteases cleave the host cell proteins involved in membrane fusion.
Hypertrophy is a response to increased hemodynamic load that results in an increase in size of ventricular myocardial cells. It is associated with an increase in the size of both ventricular myocardial cells (myocytes) and ventricular myocardial cells (fibroblasts). There is considerable evidence that ventricular myocardial hypertrophy is a primary response to increased mechanical stress on the heart, although it may also be triggered by various humoral stimuli. There is considerable evidence that ventricular myocardial hypertrophy is a primary response to increased mechanical stress on the heart, although it may also be triggered by various humoral stimuli. There are four major categories of molecular signals that are involved in the regulation of ventricular myocardial hypertrophy: (i) -intracellular Ca2 + fluxuations; (ii) -PKC activities; (iii) -MAPK activities; and (iv) -JAK / STAT activities. Each of these four categories of signals is initiated by a distinct set of stimuli and is coupled to a distinct set of effector molecules.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selective diffusion barrier that restricts the free movement of molecules between the vascular and extravascular compartments, is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis and for protecting the brain from toxins and pathogens. The brain endothelium is a single-cell layer that covers the cerebral microvessels and is composed of a polarized array of neurons and supporting glial cells. The brain endothelial cells form a diffusion barrier by forming a complex intercellular junction system, consisting of tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes. The transmembrane proteins occludin and claudin, and the cytoplasmic proteins ZO-1, -2 and -3, which directly bind to occludin and claudin, are responsible for the formation of TJs. AJs are involved in the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and are composed of three major components: cadherin, beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Desmosomes are less important for the formation of a diffusion barrier than TJs and AJs.
Specific molecular interactions between neurons are crucial for the establishment and maintenance of synapses. These interactions take place at the cell surface and are mediated by cell-surface receptors and their ligands. There are two major types of cell-surface receptors: ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that receive and transmit signals by glutamate, acetylcholine, and GABA. Metabotropic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are activated by glutamate, acetylcholine, and GABA. There are also several other receptor types: tyrosine kinases, nuclear receptors, and integrins. After ligand binding, receptors transduce signals by various second-messenger systems, including G-protein-mediated pathways and / or phospholipase C. These signals are then transmitted to the cytoplasm and / or nucleus to regulate a variety of cellular functions.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that there are approximately 40 million patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US alone. The most common causes of CKD are diabetes mellitus (DM) and glomerulonephritis (GN). DM is a significant risk factor for the development of ESRD both in adults and in children. In addition, DM is associated with significant morbidity and mortality throughout the lifespan. Although significant progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of DM, the overall prevalence and mortality rate of DM are still on the rise. GN is a major cause of ESRD in both adults and children. In adults, primary GN is usually associated with an underlying disorder or condition that results in systemic inflammation. These disorders or conditions include autoimmune disorders, infections, and genetic disorders. In children, primary GN are usually caused by congenital or acquired defects in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) or in the podocytes. These defects lead to proteinuria and progressive renal failure.
HIV-1 is a complex retrovirus that has evolved to become a major pathogen in humans. HIV-1 is transmitted sexually, via breast-feeding, and by blood transfusion. The virus is pread by sexual intercourse to a large number of individuals who are unaware of their infection. Once infected, individuals can either become asymptomatic or develop the AIDS state. HIV-1 is estimated to infect approximately 20 million individuals worldwide. The viral genome is composed of 9kb of double-stranded RNA that is packed within a viral core. The viral genome encodes for three proteins, protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase (IN), which are required for viral replication. Upon infection, HIV-1 PR cleaves the polyprotein precursors of Gag and Gag-Pol to release the mature structural proteins and enzymes. The RT and IN are involved in the conversion of viral RNA to DNA.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in 11 genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2 + sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2 + concentrations, which might cause an increase in the ATP utilization by actomyosin at maximal Ca2 + concentrations. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an increase in the ATP utilization by actomyosin is the central mechanism responsible for the development of HCM. This theory is supported by the discovery of a mutation in the taf1gene that leads to a decrease in the amount of taf1yield protein. The decrease in the amount of taf1yield protein might lead to an increase in the ATP utilization by actomyosin.
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2 + signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NR2B / NR1 NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2 + handling. As a result, stimulation of glutamate receptors leads to supranormal Ca2 + responses in HD MSN and mitochondrial Ca2 + overload. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions, though they are not primarily responsible for toxicity. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF.
Male infertility is a heterogeneous disorder that results from defects in either the egg and / or the sperm. Most of the egg-based defects are due to autoantibodies directed against oocyte-specific antigens. These autoantibodies can cause either ovarian dysfunction or complete fertilization failure. In contrast, most of the sperm-based defects are due to defects in the sperm's ability to bind to the egg. This can be caused by defects in the sperm's axoneme, the structure that provides motility for the sperm, or in the sperm's plasma membrane.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in 11 genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2 + sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2 + concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.
Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes. This figure represents the possible activation routes of different protein kinases involved in Cx43 and Cx36 phosphorylation.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that approximately 40% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases are due to diabetes mellitus. However, there is a growing number of reports that suggest that genetic factors contribute to the development of CKD. Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a rare disorder that results in a failure of renal filtration at birth or during childhood. Mutations in NPHS1, NPHS2, and WT1 are known to cause CNS. NPHS1 and NPHS2 are components of the slit diaphragm, a key structure that mediates glomerular filtration. Disruption of the slit diaphragm leads to proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.

Bladder cancer is a heterogenous disease with respect to biology and clinical course. There are two major histologic subtypes of bladder cancer, papillary and flat carcinoma. Papillary carcinoma is often preceded by simple and papillary hyperplasia, and exhibits a tendency to recur locally, but rarely invades and metastasizes. In contrast, flat carcinoma is often preceded by flat carcinoma in situ (CIS), and exhibits a tendency to recur and progress to local and distant metastases. There are four major pathways of molecular pathogenesis of bladder cancer: The first is the pathway of activating mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which is found in about 80% of low-grade papillary carcinoma and about 20% of high-grade papillary carcinoma. The second is the pathway of inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53, which is found in about 50% of high-grade papillary carcinoma and about 70% of flat CIS. The third is the pathway of mutations in the retinoblastoma gene (RB), which is found in about 50% of high-grade papillary carcinoma and about 70% of flat CIS. The fourth is the pathway of absent or reduced expression of the tumor suppressor gene summarize: Bladder cancer is a heterogenous disease with respect to biology and clinical course.

In contrast, flat carcinoma is often preceded by flat CIS, and exhibits a tendency to recur and progress to local and distant metastases.
Infertility is a problem that affects approximately 10% of all couples. In humans, about half of all cases of infertility are due to defects in sperm production, while in the other cases, the eggs are absent or defective. Male factor infertility is often associated with defects in the sperm's ability to bind to the egg's zona pellucida or to penetrate the jelly. These defects may be caused by abnormal sperm morphology, reduced sperm concentration, or abnormal sperm motility.
Small non-coding RNAs play a key role in many biological processes. They are divided into two major groups: microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). miRNAs are 2 1-2 3 nt long and are generated from longer precursors by a process of double-stranded RNA cleavage. They are involved in RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism that represses gene expression by binding to the 3 '-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs. siRNAs are 1 9-2 2 nt long and are generated from long double-stranded RNA by a process of single-stranded RNA cleavage. They are involved in RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism that represses gene expression by binding to the coding region of target mRNA.
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2 + signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NR2B / NR1 NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2 + handling. As a result, stimulation of glutamate receptors leads to supranormal Ca2 + responses in HD MSN and mitochondrial Ca2 + overload. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions, though they are not primarily responsible for toxicity. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF. While mHtt binds to p53 and upregulates levels of nuclear p53 as well as p53 transcriptional activity. Augmented p53 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction.
Specific families of membrane proteins convey signals across the plasma membrane. They are grouped into three major types: ionotropic receptors, metabotropic receptors and adhesion molecules. Ichthyosis is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that results from defects in either epidermal differentiation or barrier function. It is characterized by a generalized thickening of the skin with a predilection for the flexural areas. The severity of the phenotype may vary from mild to severe. Several genes have been identified that are associated with autosomal-recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). These genes include TGM1, ABCA1 2, and CYP4F2. Mutations in these genes lead to a reduction or loss of the respective proteins, resulting in a disruption of the lipid barrier. This in turn leads to a water-filled, abnormal skin surface pH and increased transcutaneous loss of lipids and proteins.
Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular disease. Elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are caused by genetic defects (e.g., cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5, 6-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)) or nutritional deficiency of vitamin B6, vitamin B1 2. Hcy is metabolized to methionine by methionine synthase (MTR) in a reaction that requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF). Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) catalyzes the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine. If methionine biosynthesis is impaired, then methionine sulfoxide will accumulate. Methionine-derived methionine-sulfoxide is converted to methionine by methionine sulfoxide reductase. Vitamin B1 2 is essential for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Vitamin B6 is required for the regeneration of methionine.
Sideroblastic anemia is a heterogeneous group of disorders, which are characterized by a selective reduction in the number of red blood cells (RBCs). It is classified into two major categories: X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) and autosomal-recessive sideroblastic anemia (ARSA). XLSA is caused by mutations in the erythroid-specific heme biosynthesis gene ALAS2. These mutations lead to a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin (Hb) synthesized per erythrocyte, resulting in a compensatory increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). In contrast, ARSA is caused by mutations in genes involved in iron metabolism, which result in an accumulation of iron in the bone marrow and erythrocytes.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation and maintenance is essential for brain homeostasis and proper neuronal function. The BBB consists of a polarized endothelial cell monolayer that lines the central nervous system (CNS). It restricts the paracellular movement of ions and molecules between the blood and the brain. It also promotes active transport of essential nutrients and removes harmful compounds from the brain. There are two major types of endothelial cells: brain endothelial cells (BECs) and retinal endothelial cells. BECs form the inner layer of the BBB and are connected by tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). The AJs are composed of E-cadherin and its associated proteins. The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is associated with F-actin bundles directly and indirectly. The TJs are composed of occludin, claudin and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). These three proteins form a large transmembrane protein complex. The transmembrane proteins interact with each other and with other cytoplasmic proteins to form a large protein complex. This complex summarize: Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are highly conserved, reversible morphogenetic processes that are crucial for embryonic development and tissue repair. The major features of an EMT are loss of cell-cell adhesion and increased cell motility. Several signaling pathways, including TGF-beta, Wnt and Notch, are involved in this process.
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2 + signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NR2B / NR1 NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2 + handling. As a result, stimulation of glutamate receptors leads to supranormal Ca2 + responses in HD MSN and mitochondrial Ca2 + overload. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions, though they are not primarily responsible for toxicity. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF. While mHtt binds to p53 and upregulates levels of nuclear p53 as well as p53 transcriptional activity. Augmented p53 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction.
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin. There are 4 major histologic subtypes of RCC: conventional (clear cell RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Multiple genes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for hereditary (von Hippel-Lindau) and sporadic variants of conventional (clear cell) RCC. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. An oncogene, MET has been found to be mutant in cases of hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), although the incidence of c-MET mutations is low in sporadic papillary RCC. summarize: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin.

Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells serving as the cell's main digestive compartment to which all sorts of macromolecules are delivered for degradation. They contain more than 40 hydrolases in an acidic environment (pH of about 5). After synthesis in the ER, lysosomal enzymes are decorated with mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network. They are packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to late endosomes. Substances for digestion are acquired by the lysosomes via a series of processes including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.
Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes. This figure represents the possible activation routes of different protein kinases involved in Cx43 and Cx36 phosphorylation.
Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps known as G1 and G2 phases. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage, the checkpoint kinase ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. p53 and its transcriptional targets play an important role in both G1 and G2 checkpoints. ATR-Chk1-mediated protein degradation of Cdc25A protein phosphatase is also a mechanism conferring intra-S-phase checkpoint activation.
Myelin is a lipid-rich membrane that provides rapid saltatory nerve conduction. It is essential for brain development and function. It is composed of two major components, the myelin basic protein (MBP) and the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Both proteins are highly positively charged and adhere to the negatively charged lipid bilayer via their cationic domains. This interaction leads to the formation of large lipid-protein complexes called myelin loops. The apposition of these complexes between adjacent myelin membranes is stabilized by additional non-covalent interactions.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation and maintenance are crucial for brain homeostasis and are achieved by a complex interplay of specialized brain endothelial cells (BECs). These cells form a tight barrier between the circulating blood and the brain parenchyma by means of a double-layered plasma membrane, consisting of an apical (luminal) and a basolateral (abluminal) membrane. The paracellular diffusion of molecules is restricted by the presence of tight junctions (TJs), which are composed of occludin, claudin, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). Furthermore, specialized intracellular organelles, the Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), contribute to the regulation of vascular permeability by the release of vasoactive molecules such as P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1). These molecules are transported from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the BECs via regulated exocytosis. Furthermore, brain endothelial cells express various nutrient transporters that are crucial for the uptake of nutrients and ions from the blood. These include the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT), the glucose transporter (Glut), the proton-dependent amino acid transporter (PAAT), and the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT).
Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.
Myocarditis is a cardiac disease associated with inflammation and injury of the myocardium. It results from various etiologies, both noninfectious and infectious, but coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is still considered the dominant etiological agent. Myocarditis may be caused by direct cytopathic effects of virus, a pathologic immune response to persistent virus, or autoimmunity triggered by the viral infection. The virus enters the myocyte through internalization of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) and its coreceptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Viral proteases cleave various proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to apoptosis. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells. CVB infection is a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well as myocarditis. Epidemiologically, myocarditis underlies a significant portion of patients with DCM.
Sideroblastic anemia are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which are characterized by a selective reduction in the number of red blood cells with a normal or increased number of white blood cells. The two major subtypes are X-linked (XLAS) and autosomal dominant (AD-SAIDO). XLAS is caused by mutations in the erythroid alpha-spectrin gene (SPTA1), which lead to a complete absence of spectrin in red blood cells. AD-SAIDO is caused by mutations in the gene for protein band 3 (EPB3). In addition, there are several less common subtypes of sideroblastic anemia.

Sodium hypochlorite is a strong oxidizer and disinfectant that is commonly used in the food and health industries. It is also used in the chemical industry for the production of bleach. Sodium hypochlorite cleaves sulfur-containing amino acids, forming methionine sulfoxide and methionine sulfone. Cysteine is also oxidized to form cystine. These oxidized amino acids are not recognized by the organism's methionine sulfoxide reductase. Therefore, hypochlorite-induced protein damage may be repaired by methionine sulfoxide reductase. Glutathione is a peptide-SH-containing compound that plays a key role in many cellular processes, including the detoxification of xenobiotics and peroxides. Glutathione peroxidase, a key enzyme involved in the glutathione-dependent peroxide detoxification pathway, catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide to glutathione. Glutathione reductase catalyzes the regeneration of glutathione.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation and maintenance is essential for brain homeostasis and proper brain function. The BBB is a complex structure consisting of a polarized endothelial cell monolayer that lines the brain microvessels and restricts the passage of molecules from the blood into the brain. The brain endothelial cells form tight junctions (TJs) that limit the paracellular diffusion of ions and large molecules. Furthermore, brain endothelial cells express specific transport systems for nutrients and xenobiotics. These systems include nutrient transporters such as glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1) and amino acid transporters, and drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Various membrane proteins and soluble factors are involved in the formation and maintenance of TJs. Among them, occludin and claudin constitute the transmembrane proteins, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) are the cytoplasmic proteins. Various signaling pathways regulate the expression of junctional proteins and the formation of TJs.
Saccharum officinare is one of the most important crops worldwide. It is also a traditional medicine in many parts of the world. The main active components are sucrose, fructose, and glucose. Fructose is the main sweetener in fruit, and glucose is the main sweetener in beverages. Fructose and glucose are absorbed in the intestine by a passive diffusion mechanism. Fructose enters the cell through the glucose transporter (GLUT2), and glucose through the glucokinase (GCK). Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate is further split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which are then converted to pyruvate and NADH. The absorption of sucrose is via a proton-coupled sucrose transporter (HST).
Myelin is a lipid-rich membrane that provides a conductive medium for rapid saltatory nerve impulse transmission. It is essential for rapid and efficient neuronal signaling and is formed by the spiral wrapping of plasma membranes of two neighboring oligodendrocytes around a central axon. Each myelin membrane is separated from the cytoplasm by a double lipid bilayer, the intraperiod line. The major structural component of myelin is the myelin basic protein (MBP), which accounts for more than 50% of the total myelin protein. Several other proteins, such as Po, DM-2 0, and Golli are also major constituents of myelin. The assembly of MBP into a stable membrane structure is dependent on its interaction with lipids and other myelin proteins. In addition, several proteins with different functions are released from myelin during pathological conditions. These include the water-soluble MBP fragments, which are able to trigger an inflammatory response in the brain.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc-gamma-R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.
Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in 11 genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2 + sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2 + concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.
Cutaneous melanoma is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 2% of all skin cancers. Although melanoma is curable by surgical excision when it is diagnosed early, patients with metastatic melanoma have a very poor prognosis. Molecular mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of melanoma include activating mutations in the BRAF gene, which are found in approximately 50% of melanomas, and inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways.

This figure represents the possible activation routes of different protein kinases involved in Cx43 and Cx36 phosphorylation.
Hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition of elevated plasma homocysteine levels (> 15 micromol / L). It is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and venous thrombosis. It is caused by genetic defects in genes that regulate homocysteine metabolism or by nutritional deficiencies of vitamin B6, vitamin B1 2 or folate. Vitamin deficiencies lead to decreased intracellular levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine, an inhibitor of methyl-transferases, resulting in increased homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is metabolized to methionine by methionine synthase (MTR) or methionine synthase reductase (MTRR). Methionine is converted to SAM, a methyl group donor. SAM-dependent methyltransferases are involved in many essential cellular processes, such as DNA methylation for regulation of gene expression. DNA hypomethylation may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis by increasing the expression of adhesion molecules, platelet activation, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Chronic homocysteinemia can lead to endothelial dysfunction through increased oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, homocysteine may interfere with nitric oxide (NO) metabolism by interfering with the conversion of arginine to citrulline. NO is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. The reduced availability of NO may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.

Cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a key mechanism for killing of virus-infected cells and tumor cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), also known as killer T cells, provide a cell-mediated response to specific foreign antigens associated with cells. CTLs only respond to foreign antigen when it is presented bound to the MHC-1 expressed on the surface of all cells. CTLs do not respond to soluble antigen, but induce apoptosis in viral-infected cells and in cancer cells. When the complex of antigen bound to MHC-1 is bound to antigen-specific T cell receptor, the cytotoxic T cell induces apoptosis in the target cell primarily by two pathways, one involving perforin-mediated apoptosis and the other involving Fas / Fas-ligand interaction. When CTLs are activated by recognition of specific antigen on a cell, they release perforin proteins that integrate into the membrane of the target cell and organize to form a membrane pore. This allows the protease granzyme to enter the cell and activate the apoptotic caspase proteolytic cascade, and also allows other molecules to cross the cell membrane and trigger osmotic lysis of the membrane. The interaction of T-cell Fas ligand with the Fas receptor in the target cell can also activate the caspase cascade and other pathways involved in apoptosis. The interaction of a CTL with antigen-MHC I complex activates the CTL to proliferate and amplify the clone of T cells that respond to that antigen, amplifying the immune response against that specific antigen.

The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer. PA28 gamma has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. PA200 has been identified as a large nuclear protein that stimulates proteasomal hydrolysis of peptides.

Phospholipases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of the ester bond in phospholipids. They are involved in many important physiological and pathological processes such as egg fertilization, blood clotting, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. There are four major groups of phospholipases: the secreted phospholipase A (sPLA), the intracellular phospholipase A (iPLA), the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A (Lp-PLA), and the plasmalogen-specific phospholipase A (pPLA). The sPLAs are involved in inflammation by releasing the inflammatory factors arachidonic acid and its derivatives. The iPLAs are involved in the release of lipid mediators during inflammation and apoptosis. The Lp-PLA is involved in the development of atherosclerosis through the degradation of lipoproteins. The pPLAs are involved in inflammation through the release of platelet-activating factor and the oxidation of LDL.
