  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.",
  "Endocytosis is a mechanism for cells to remove ligands, nutrients, and plasma membrane (PM) proteins, and lipids from the cell surface, bringing them into the cell interior. Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type.",
  "Contraction of the heart is a complex process initiated by the electrical excitation of cardiac myocytes (excitation-contraction coupling, ECC). In cardiac myocytes, Ca2 + influx induced by activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (DHP receptors) upon membrane depolarization triggers the release of Ca2 + via Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through a Ca2 + -induced Ca release (CICR) mechanism. Ca2 + ions released via the CICR mechanism diffuse through the cytosolic space to contractile proteins to bind to troponinC resulting in the release of inhibition induced by troponinI. The Ca2 + binding to troponinC thereby triggers the sliding of thin and thick filaments, that is, the activation of a crossbridge and subsequent cardiac force development and / or cell shortening. Recovery occurs as Ca2 + is pumped out of the cell by the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) or is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by sarco (endo) plasmic Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) pumps on the non-junctional region of the SR.",
  "IL-10 is a cytokine with potent anti-inflammatory properties, repressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 by activated macrophages. The IL-10 receptor is in the JAK / STAT class of receptors but activation of the JAK / STAT pathways by IL-10 does not appear on its own to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of this cytokine. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 appear to require induction of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through a map kinase pathway involving the p38 kinases. HO-1 is involved in the biosynthesis of heme, and catalyzes a reaction producing carbon monoxide, free iron, and the heme precursor biliverdin. HO-1 is induced by IL-10 and is also induced by oxidative stress. Blocking HO-1 with inhibitors or antisense blocks the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10. The anti-inflammatory actions of HO-1 appear to be the result of signaling by carbon monoxide it produces since removal of CO blocks the anti-inflammatory action",
  "The cell cycle is regulated by the interplay of many molecules. Key among these are the cyclins which are expressed and then degraded in a concerted fashion to drive the stages of the cell cycle. Cyclins combine with cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) to form activated kinases that phosphorylate targets leading to cell cycle regulation. A breakdown in the regulation of this cycle can lead to out of control growth and contribute to tumor formation. Defects in many of the molecules that regulate the cell cycle have been implicated in cancer. Key among these are p53, the cdk inhibitors (p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27), and Rb, all of which act to keep the cell cycle from progressing until all repairs to damaged DNA have been completed.",
  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",
  "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in physiological blood vessel formation and pathological angiogenesis such as tumor growth and ischemic diseases. Hypoxia is a potent inducer of VEGF in vitro. The increase in secreted biologically active VEGF protein from cells exposed to hypoxia is partly because of an increased transcription rate, mediated by binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) to a hypoxia responsive element in the 5 '-flanking region of the VEGF gene. bHLH-PAS transcription factor that interacts with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), and its predicted amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1a) product. HLF mRNA expression is closely correlated with that of VEGF mRNA.. The high expression level of HLF mRNA in the O2 delivery system of developing embryos and adult organs suggests that in a normoxic state, HLF regulates gene expression of VEGF, various glycolytic enzymes, and others driven by the HRE sequence, and may be involved in development of blood vessels and the tubular system of lung. VEGF expression is dramatically induced by hypoxia due in large part to an increase in the stability",
  "While T cells and B cells carry out the actions of antigen-specific immune responses, antigen-presenting cells called dendritic cells are required for this to happen. The name of dendritic cells is based on their shape, with activated dendritic cells displaying long processes on their surface. When immature dendritic cells found throughout the body internalize and present antigen, they express markers that stimulate the activation of lymphocytes, and migrate to lymphocyte rich tissues like the spleen and lymph nodes to initiate immune responses. In addition to stimulating responses against antigens, dendritic cells also produce tolerance to self antigens. Dendritic cells can be derived from either myeloid or lymphoid lineages. Monocyte derived lineages (pDC1) stimulate Th1 cell differentiation while plasmacytoid (lymphoid) dendritic cells (pDC2) induce Th2 cell differentiation. Factors that stimulate the maturation of monocytes derived dendritic cells include GM-CSF, and IL-4. IL-3 stimulates the differentiation of pDC2 cells into DC2 cells. A variety of factors are involved in antigen-recognition and processing by immature dendritic cells and in the maturation of these cells. The transition to mature dendritic cells down-regulates the factors involved in",
  "Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), potentially lethal lesions. HR takes place in the late S-G2 phase of the cell cycle and involves the generation of a single-stranded region of DNA, followed by strand invasion, formation of a Holliday junction, DNA synthesis using the intact strand as a template, branch migration and resolution. It is investigated that RecA / Rad51 family proteins play a central role. The breast cancer susceptibility protein Brca2 and the RecQ helicase BLM (Bloom syndrome mutated) are tumor suppressors that maintain genome integrity, at least in part, through HR.",
  "One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",
  "The role of Hemophilus influenzae in ear infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes the induction of an inflammatory response through activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. In addition to activation of inflammatory cytokine genes like IL-1 and TNF, H. influenzae activates TLR2 expression and genes involved in mucus production. Hemophilus influenzae activates NF-kB by multiple mechanisms, starting with activation of the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by the p16 protein in the H. influenzae outer membrane. TLR2 plays a key role in innate immune responses and is expressed in high levels in lymphoid cells as well as low levels in epithelial cells. The role of TLR2 was supported by blocking NF-kB activation with a dominant negative TLR2 and increasing it with transfection of a normal TLR2 gene. TLR2 in turn activates TAK1, which activates two divergent signaling pathways. One of these pathways leads to IkB kinase activation, IkB phosphorylation and degradation, releasing the NF-kB heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. In the alternate pathway, TAK1 also activates NF-kB through a Map kinase pathway, activating p38 and NF",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.",

  "The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Normally, ligand-dependent signaling by Hedgehog (Hh) homologs proceeds through binding to the Patched receptor. This binding relieves the Patched-mediated inhibition of signaling through the Smoothened (SMOH) gene product. This signaling ultimately results in the dissociation of the Gli1 transcription factor from an inhibitory complex in the cytoplasm, its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, and activation of target gene expression. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (> 50%) in sporadic BCC.",
  "Progression through the cell cycle is accompanied by activation of the proto-oncogene c-Src, a protein tyrosine kinase. Overexpression of Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein substrates and cellular transformation. During interphase the Src protein folds back upon itself to stay in the inactive state, with a phophotyrosine residue in one domain at Tyrosine 529 bound by an SH2 domain in the same protein. Activation of c-Src involves protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTP-alpha, or RPTP-alpha), a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic phosphatase domain. A variety of evidence has indicated that PTP-alpha dephosphorylates c-Src at Tyr529, allowing Src to open up and become activated, and that this activation occurs in association with mitosis. To activate Src, PTP-alpha must first open up the folded Src through binding itself to the phosphorylated Src domain, a process blocked by binding of Grb-2 to PTP-alpha at phosphorylated Tyr789. PTP-alpha phosphorylated at Tyr789 also binds to the Src SH2 domain, causing the Src structure to open at Src Tyr52",
  "The motor defects of Parkinson's disease are related to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in specific brain regions. Examination of these neurons in diseased tissue has revealed the presence of Lewy bodies, dense aggregates that include the protein alpha-synuclein. A genetic basis for most cases of Parkinson's disease has not yet been identified, but mutations in alpha-synuclein have been associated with at least one rare form of the disease, and mutations in another protein, the parkin gene, are associated with another inherited form of Parkinson's disease. Parkin is found in Lewy bodies along with alpha-synuclein and the parkin protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Parkin appears to work in conjuction with ubiquitin activating (Uba) 1, an E1 protein and the ubiquitin-conjugating (Ubc) enzymes UbcH7 and 8. The E1 delivers ubiquitin to the E2 in a cycle that creates an increasing chain of ubiquitin. The Parkin E3 ligates this onto substrates and so tags these proteins in normal cells, targeting them for destruction in the proteosome. One of the proteins that parkin normally targets for destruction is a specific O-glycosylated form of alpha-",
  "The epidermis, which provides a protective barrier that undergoes a constant renewal, is a multi-layered tissue with the proliferating cells located in the basal layer. As cells leave the basal layer the underog significant differentiation, biochemical and morphological remodeling. The final differentiation results in the formation of corneocytes. In vitro keratinocytes mimic this process. Several genes mark keratinocyte specific differentiation. Among the most frequently tracked markers are Transglutaminase, Cystatin and Involucrin. The keratinocyte differentiation studies have identified and provided significant detail regarding the involvement of three of the 4 major MAP kinase pathways from several diverse stimuli such as EGF, FAS, TNF and Calicium influx. The p38 cascade is represented twice since both p38alpha (p38) and p38delta (MAPK13) are involved. The keratinocyte differentiation cascased also provide for detailed study of the functions of individual PKC isoforms. It is interesting to note the contrasting functions of the PKC isoforms in this process. In recent studies it has been determined that the cPKC (conventional / classical Protein Kinase C) isoforms, which are calcium-",
  "Clot formation and fibrinolysis is a balance of plasmin activation / inhibition and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity that regulates fibrin polymer formation and degradation. Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by",
  "All taste pathways are proposed to converge on common elements that mediate a rise in intracellular Ca2 + followed by neurotransmitter release. Na + salt depolarizes taste cells by passive influx of Na + through the amiloride-sensitive Na + channel (ENaC). Acids depolarize taste cells by a variety of mechanisms, including influx of protons (H +) through ENaC and a proton-gated cation channel (MDEG). Two putative umami receptors have been identified: a truncated variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 and the heterodimer, T1R1 + T1R3. Umami receptors are coupled to a signaling pathway involving activation of PLCbeta2, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activation of a transient receptor potential channel, TRPM5. Bitter compounds, such as denatonium and PROP, activate particular T2R / TRB isoforms, which activate gustducin heterotrimers. Activated alpha-gustducin stimulates PDE to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas betagamma subunits activate PLCbeta2 to generate IP3, which leads to release of Ca2 + from internal stores. Artificial sweeteners activate GPCRs (",
  "The T Cell Receptor plays a key role in the immune system. The specificity of the receptor is governed by the binding site formed from the mature alpha and beta chains (shown here) or gamma and delta chains in gamma / delta T Cells. It is the ability of this receptor to bind a complex of foreign peptide in the groove of an MHC molecule that leads to T cell activation. Upon activation the T cell can assist in activating other cells or carry out cytolytic attacks depending on the particular T cell type. The CD3 complex and CD4 (Th cells) or CD8 (Tc cells) work to transmit the activation signal to the T cell's transcriptional machinary upon engagement of the receptor.",
  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. During an inflammation or immune reaction, specialized leukocytes (eosinophilic granulocytes) adhere to and pass through the endothelium of the blood vessels and the underlying matrix. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flattening of the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or even through the intercellular matrix. This is mediated by a homophilic interactions of PECAM and CD31.",
  "T cell activation is initiated by recognition of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of Class II MHC on an antigen-presenting cell. The T cell receptor contains multiple subunits and interacts with several factors to transduce antigen-stimulated T cell activation. One of the key steps that initiates receptor activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR subunits by the src family protein kinases Lck and Fyn. T cell receptor phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn recruits the ZAP-70 protein kinase to the receptor complex, which becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways like the Map kinase cascade. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase activates Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating these proteins and is required for TCR activation. Association of the CD4 coreceptor with Lck may also be involved in Lck activation.",
  "The appropriate signaling through the insulin pathway is critical for the regulation of glucose levels and the avoidance of diabetes. Insulin forms a complex with the Insulin Receptor (IR) and b chains to form the active signaling complex. Through recruitment of adaptor molecules and the activation of RAS, the activated IR can cause transcriptional activation.",
  "The ever evolving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways consist of four major groupings and numerous related proteins which constitute interrelated signal transduction cascades activated by stimuli such as growth factors, stress, cytokines and inflammation. The four major groupings are the Erk (red), JNK or SAPK (blue), p38 (green) and the Big MAPK or ERK5 (light blue) cascades. Signals from cell surface receptors such as GPCRs and growth factor receptors are transduced, directly or via small G proteins such as ras and rac, to multiple tiers of protein kinases that amplify these signals and / or regulate each other. The diagram is organized to illustrate the cascades by the background colors and also the tiers of kinases as indicated down the left hand side and separated by the horizontal dashed lines. In some cascades the first activation tier involves the MAPKKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases or MAP4K proteins. The next tier are the serine / threonine MAPKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase or MAP3Ks such as RAF, TAK, ASK, and MEKK1. This level has the greatest amount of cross-communication cu",
  "After transcription, eukaryotic mRNA precursors contain protein-coding exons and noncoding introns. In the following splicing, introns are excised and exons are joined by a macromolecular complex, the spliceosome. The standard spliceosome is made up of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, and several spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs). Spliceosomes are not a simple stable complex, but a dynamic family of particles that assemble on the mRNA precursor and help fold it into a conformation that allows transesterification to proceed. Various spliceosome forms (e.g. A-, B- and C-complexes) have been identified.",
  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. During step 1, the conditioning regimen (irradiation and / or chemotherapy) leads to damage, activation of host tissues and induction of inflammatory cytokines secretion. Increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and adhesion molecules leads to enhancement of the recognition of host MHC and / or minor histocompatibility antigens by mature donor T cells. Donor T-cell activation in step II is characterized by the predominance of Th1 cells and the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. These cytokines induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which leaks through the intestinal mucosa that was damaged during step 1, together with IFN-gamma, from step 2, further stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines and NO. During step 3, the effector",
  "Hypertrophy associated with both hypertension and obstruction to ventricular outflow leads to pathologic cardiac growth and it is associated with increase morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic ventricular disease takes a growing toll on the health of nations. As other cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infraction are in decline as causes of mortality, the heart failure problem becomes increasingly urgent. Congenital heart defects occur in 1% of live births and fetal heart malformations are implicated in many pregnancies that end in still-birth or spontaneous abortion. The current paradigm suggests that the heart adapts to excess of hemodynamic loading by compensatory hypertrophy, which under condition of persistent stress, over time evolves into dysfunction and myocardial failure. There is considerable evidence that direct effects of increased mechanical stress are sensed within the ventricular wall and that signals critical for the generation of growth responses. Despite compelling statistics we still do not understand biochemically why heart defects are so prevalent. A single transcriptional regulator initially associated with the activation of the T-cells",
  "Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that can lead to development of Th2 cells. The 140 kD IL-4 Receptor (CD124) is found on many cell types, even those of non-hematopoietic origen. The receptor is formed from two chains: IL-4R (alpha) and the IL-2R gamma chain (CD132). Primary signaling is through the JAK / Stat6 pathway and MAPKs.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.",
  "The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer",
  "TNF acts on several different signaling pathways through two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 to regulate apoptotic pathways, NF-kB activation of inflammation, and activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Interaction of TNFR1 with TRADD leads to activation of NF-kB and apoptosis pathways, while interaction with TRAF2 has generally been thought to be involved in stress kinase and NF-kB activation but is not required for TNF to induce apoptosis. Activation of NF-kB is mediated by TRAF2 through the NIK kinase and also by RIP but the observation that TNF activates NF-kB in mice lacking TRAF2 indicates that TRAF-2 does not play an essential role in this process. Stress-activated protein kinases, also called JNKs, are a family of map kinases activated by cellular stress and inflammatory signals. Binding of TNF to the TNFR1 receptor activates the germinal center kinase (GCK) through the TNF adaptor Traf2, activating the map kinase MEKK1. Both GCK and MEKK1 interact with Traf2, and GCK is required for MEKK1 activation by TNF, but GCK kinase activity does not appear to be required for MEKK1 activation. Instead, GCK activates",
  "Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF / CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF / CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the Endo",

  "The transcription factor CREB binds the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and activates transcription in response to a variety of extracellular signals including neurotransmitters, hormones, membrane depolarization, and growth and neurotrophic factors. Protein kinase A and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CaMKII stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, a key regulatory site controlling transcriptional activity. Growth and neurotrophic factors also stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133. Phosphorylation occurs at Ser133 via p44 / 42 MAP Kinase and p90RSK and also via p38 MAP Kinase and MSK1. CREB exhibit deficiencies in spatial learning tasks, while flies overexpressing or lacking CREB show enhanced or diminished learning, respectively.",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, members of the Ras GTPase superfamily that were initially recognized and purified because of their ability to stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the cholera toxin A subunit. We now know that they are critical components of several different vesicular trafficking pathways in all eukaryotic cells and activators of specific phospholipase Ds (PLDs) (reviewed in Refs. 13). ARF interacts with many proteins and other molecules that regulate its state of activation or are involved in its intracellular function. Arf proteins cycle between GDP-bound, inactive and GTP-bound, active forms, and the cycling is regulated by specific GEPs and GAPs. Members of the Arf GEP family can be grouped into two major subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities and functional differences. The high-molecular-weight Arf GEP subfamily includes yeast Sec7, Gea1, and Gea2, and mammalian BIG1 / p200, BIG2, and GBF1, which all consist of 1,400 2,000 amino acid residues. Many Arf",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specifically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.",
  "CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor in the GPCR gene family, and is expressed by cells in the immune system and the central nervous system. In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role",
  "The heparan sulphate proteoglycan agrin is well known as the key assembly factor of postsynaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), but recent data suggest it also plays a direct role in the organization of the cytoskeleton in the skeletal muscle. Signaling through muscle-specific proteins such as muscle specific kinase (MuSK) and or acetylcholine receptor (AchRs) / rapsyn, agrin can activate ubiquitously expressed Rac, Cdc42, and p21-activated kinase (PAK) that are involved in actin polymerization. Agrin also engages signaling pathways of several potent oncogenes (i.e., SFK, ErbB receptors, and cortactin).",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is one of a family of neurotrophins that induce the survival and proliferation of neurons. In cell culture NGF induces the formation of neurite projections and in vivo may stimulate the innervation of tissues. NGF plays a role in the repair, regeneration, and protection of neurons, and as such could serve as a therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. One potential method of NGF application would be through gene therapy or through implantation of cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo. NGF has also been suggested to play a role in other physiological systems and tissues such as the immune system. NGF has two receptors, TrkA and the p75 (NTR). NGF may signal its neuroprotective actions through the tyrosine kinase TrkA receptor and trigger apoptosis in some cells through the p75 receptor. High-affinity binding of NGF requires both TrkA and p75 (NTR). Binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor causes activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream signaling cascades. One of the downstream signaling pathways of NGF activates phospholipase C, releasing DAG and IP3 and activating associated downstream pathways such as protein kinase",
  "The T Cell Receptor plays a key role in the immune system. The specificity of the receptor is governed by the binding site formed from the mature alpha and beta chains (shown here) or gamma and delta chains in gamma / delta T Cells. It is the ability of this receptor to bind a complex of foreign peptide in the groove of an MHC molecule that leads to T cell activation. Upon activation the T cell can assist in activating other cells or carry out cytolytic attacks depending on the particular T cell type. The CD3 complex and CD4 (Th cells) or CD8 (Tc cells) work to transmit the activation signal to the T cell's transcriptional machinary upon engagement of the receptor.",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mechanism to recognize and repair bulky DNA damage caused by compounds, environmental carcinogens, and exposure to UV-light. In humans hereditary defects in the NER pathway are linked to at least three diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The repair of damaged DNA involves at least 30 polypeptides within two different sub-pathways of NER known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR-NER) and global genome repair (GGR-NER). TCR refers to the expedited repair of lesions located in the actively transcribed strand of genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). In GGR-NER the first step of damage recognition involves XPC-hHR23B complex together with XPE complex (in prokaryotes, uvrAB complex). The following steps of GGR-NER and TCR-NER are similar.",
  "Interaction of T cell receptor with specific antigen in the context of MHC II activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to T cell activation. In the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the src family kinases Lck and Fyn are activated to phosphorylate proteins in the T cell receptor complex which recruit and activate the ZAP70 kinase. The activation of ZAP70 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate MAP kinase pathways and cause T cell activation. The CD45 phosphorylase also plays a role in T cell receptor signaling, dephosphorylated Lck and Fyn to activate them. Other factors modulate T cell receptor activation. Csk (COOH-terminal Srk kinase) phosphorylates Lck and deactivates it, opposing the action of CD45. The phosphorylation of Lck by Csk inhibits T cell receptor signaling and inhibits T cell activation. Csk activity is regulated in T cells by PKA, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated by the second messenger cAMP. The activity of Csk also appears to depend on other factors such as CBP, which recruits Csk to the plasma membrane in lipid rafts where other signaling factors such the T cell receptor complex are localized. CBP also directly activates Csk.",
  "Neutrophils respond to bacterial infection by releasing reactive oxygen species that kill bacteria and by expressing chemokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection. The multisubunit enzyme NADPH oxidase expressed by neutrophils produces reactive oxygen species rapidly released in what is known as the respiratory burst. Activity of the NADPH oxidase is induced by fMLP receptor ligands, formylated peptides from bacteria. The fMLP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, FPR-1, that activates Map kinase pathways and phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation releases IP3 and calcium, activating protein kinase C and also activating the transcription factor NFAT, which contributes to activation of chemokine genes. One of the components of the NADPH oxidase is p47phox. PKC activation phosphorylates p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase activity. Activation of Map kinase cascades leads to Erk1 / Erk2 dependent p47phox phosphorylation as well as activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and chemokine gene expression. Inhibition of p38 did not affect p47phox phosphorylation, indicating that p38 is not involved in Erk1 / 2 activation of the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of p38 did inhibit",
  "As with many cell-surface receptors, activation of the EGF receptor can result in receptor internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis, desensitizing further receptor signaling. This process requires clathrin and occurs in clathrin-coated pits, which pinch off from the plasma membrane to form vesicles that move to the early endosome. From the early endosome, receptors can either be recycled back to the cell surface, or they can move through the late endosome to the lysosome for proteolytic degradation. The sorting of receptors in the early endosome for degradation requires the tyrosine kinase activity of activated growth factor receptor, and involves ubiquitination of the receptor. Targeting of receptors for degradation requires members of the Cbl gene family. Cbl proteins bind to tyrosine phosphorylated EGF receptor, and are E3 ubiquitination ligases that label receptor for degradation. Cbl also recruits Cin85 to the receptor complex, and blocking Cin85 interaction blocks receptor internalization and degradation. Endophilins are also a member of this receptor-bound protein complex. In its role as a ubiquitin ligase and docking protein, Cbl desensitizes EGF signaling and also opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF. EGF activation also appears to",
  "B cells must communicate with their environment to participate in the immune system as the source of antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates activation of B cells and T cells through dephosphorylation of signaling factors. CD32 is",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, members of the Ras GTPase superfamily that were initially recognized and purified because of their ability to stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the cholera toxin A subunit. We now know that they are critical components of several different vesicular trafficking pathways in all eukaryotic cells and activators of specific phospholipase Ds (PLDs) (reviewed in Refs. 13). ARF interacts with many proteins and other molecules that regulate its state of activation or are involved in its intracellular function. Arf proteins cycle between GDP-bound, inactive and GTP-bound, active forms, and the cycling is regulated by specific GEPs and GAPs. Members of the Arf GEP family can be grouped into two major subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities and functional differences. The high-molecular-weight Arf GEP subfamily includes yeast Sec7, Gea1, and Gea2, and mammalian BIG1 / p200, BIG2, and GBF1, which all consist of 1,400 2,000 amino acid residues. Many Arf",
  "Phagocytosis plays an essential role in host-defense mechanisms through the uptake and destruction of infectious pathogens. Specialized cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes take part in this process in higher organisms. After opsonization with antibodies (IgG), foreign extracellular materials are recognized by Fc gamma receptors. Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors initiates a variety of signals mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, which lead through the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and membrane remodeling to the formation of phagosomes. Nascent phagosomes undergo a process of maturation that involves fusion with lysosomes. The acquisition of lysosomal proteases and release of reactive oxygen species are crucial for digestion of engulfed materials in phagosomes.",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "Cell adhesion molecules are (glyco) proteins expressed on the cell surface and play a critical role in a wide array of biologic processes that include hemostasis, the immune response, inflammation, embryogenesis, and development of neuronal tissue. There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. Membrane proteins that mediate immune cellcell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions are important for brain morphology and highly coordinated brain functions such as memory and learning. During early development of the nervous system, neurons elongate their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of cell-cell adhesions. Cell-cell adhesions also underpin axon-axon contacts and link neurons with supporting schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.",
  "Thrombin is an extracellular protease that is involved in the clotting of blood and inflammation through its action on platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature and that plays a role in thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4. PAR1 activation may be involved in the dilation of arteries during inflammation through the action of thrombin on endothelial cells and in platelet activation by thrombin during clotting. PAR1 and PAR2 activation cause bronchodilation in airway and may protect against",
  "Oxidative stress is one factor that can trigger programmed cell death. Activated neutrophils responding to inflammatory stimulation produce reactive oxygen species like superoxide free radicals to kill invading bacteria, but these reactive oxygen species can also attack endothelial cells lining the vascular wall and trigger apoptosis. Endothelial cells also produce reactive oxygen species inside the cell that can contribute to oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as during reperfusion injury following ischemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts highly reactive and damaging superoxide free radicals to peroxides that are less reactive than superoxide but stimulate apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) peptide reducing agent removes toxic metabolites and repairs damage created by reactive oxygen species. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), for example, removes peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent, and glutathione reductase (GSR) regenerates reduced glutathione. Inside the endothelial cell peroxide can be converted to hydroxyl ions in the presence of iron. Peroxides and hydroxyl radicals activate NF-kB and activate expression of inflammatory genes including adhesion molecules, TNF and IL-8. The apoptotic response of endothelial cells to oxidative stress may be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",
  "Several forms of post-translational modification regulate protein activities. Recently, protein methylation by CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) has been observed to play a key role in transcriptional regulation. CARM1 associates with the p160 class of transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by steroid hormone family receptors. CARM1 also interacts with CBP / p300 transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by a large variety of transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors and CEBP. One target of CARM1 is the core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets of the histone acetylase activity of CBP / p300 coactivators. Recruitment of CARM1 to the promoter region by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and makes promoter regions more accessible for transcription. Another target of CARM1 methylation is a coactivator it interacts with, CBP. Methylation of CBP by CARM1 blocks CBP from acting as a coactivator for CREB and redirects the limited CBP pool in the cell to be available for steroid hormone receptors. Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known.",
  "Over 1,000 papers and reviews have been written about the role of ceramide in the production of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Ceramide is a sphingosine-based lipid-signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This diagram represents some of the current understanding of the cascades that couple ceramide to specific signaling pathways. These cascades illustrate that ceramide can be a growth stimulus or proapototic signal. The ultimate ceramide action is determined within the context of other stimuli and by the subcellular topology of its production and is cell-type specific. There are 2 forms of sphingomyelinase, acid (acid-sphingomyelinase: A-SMase) and neutral (neutral-sphingomyelinase N-SMase), that can produce ceramide. TNF-alpha can stimulate either form of sphingomyelinase as can other death receptors. Different domanis of TNF-alpha stimulate the different Smases. N-SMase stimulation is enhanced by the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1). The activity of each form is dependent on the local intracellular pH. In the illustration the forms are seperated to reduce confusion however",
  "mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appears to play a central role in signaling caused by nutrients and mitogens such as growth factors to regulate translation. The drug rapamycin acts on mammalian cells through the mTOR protein kinase, also known as FRAP. When bound to the immunophilin binding protein FKBP12, rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity and has immunosuppressant activity. Rapamycin and the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 are being tested as anti-cancer agents, acting to block mitogenic signaling. Recently, mTOR was also found to act as an ATP sensor to regulate cell growth. Upstream activation of PI 3 kinase activity that leads to oncogenic transformation can be blocked by inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. Growth factor receptors first stimulate PI 3 kinase, and through inositol phosphates activate PDK-1 and AKT (protein kinase B). AKT phosphorylates mTOR. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP by mTOR and the phosphorylation downstream of RPS6 and EIF-4B stimulate translational initiation and contribute to cell growth.",
  "Inflammation is a complex response involving many different cells and signaling molecules, including the secretion of the cytokine IL-17 by activated T cells. IL-17 secretion is restricted to specific subsets of T cells but the receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed throughout the body, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders. Fibroblasts and other cells stimulated by IL-17 are induced themselves to secrete inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). These cytokines in turn provoke a range of activities, including the stimulation of neutrophil proliferation and differentiation.",
  "Erythropoietin functions to increase the number of red blood cells. Thus, it has found utility as a drug for those needing to replenish erythrocytes for a number of reasons. The signaling mechanism includes multimerization of the receptor upon ligand binding, activation of MAPK cascade, and phosphorylation and activation of Stat5.",
  "Activation of the protease-activated GPCRs in platelets contributes to platelet activation in clotting. The protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved by the protease thrombin, releasing a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor and triggers intracellular calcium release. Platelets from mice lacking the PAR4 gene are not activated by thrombin and are impaired in clotting, supporting the importance of thrombin signaling through PAR4 in clotting. Human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, with PAR1 playing a more dominant role in clotting in humans. Calcium release induced by PARs activates PKC, modulating integrin alpha IIB beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb / IIIa) and opening integrin ligand binding sites to contribute to platelet aggregation. Intracellular calcium increases induced by thrombin activates phospholipase A2, liberating arachidonic acid, the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis. Ras / Map kinase activation by the PAR receptors also activates phospholipase A2. The activation of PAR-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by aspirin, indicating that thromboxane production induced by PAR signaling contributes to platelet activation. Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin PGG2 by the enzyme Cox-1 in platelets, and Cox-1 is",
  "The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) couples binding of extracellular growth factor ligands to intracellular signaling pathways regulating diverse biologic responses, including proliferation, differentiation, cell motility, and survival. Ligand binding to the four closely related members of this RTK family -epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB-1 or HER1), ErbB-2 (HER2), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4) -induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues (pY) within the cytoplasmic tail. Signaling effectors containing binding pockets for pY-containing peptides are recruited to activated receptors and induce the various signaling pathways. The Shc- and / or Grb2-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a common target downstream of all ErbB receptors. Similarly, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway is directly or indirectly activated by most ErbBs. Several cytoplasmic docking proteins appear to be recruited by specific ErbB receptors and less exploited by others. These include the adaptors Crk",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged / Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc) -co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.",
  "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) formation is either de novo (primary GBMs) or due to the progression of a lower grade glioma to a higher grade one through the acquisition of additional mutations (secondary GBMs). In primary GBM, disruption of the p53 pathway often occurs through loss of ARF, or less frequently through amplification of MDM2. Disruption of the RB pathway occurs through loss of INK4A. Amplification and / or mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the most frequently detected genetic defect that is associated with primary GBM. In secondary GBM, loss of p53 and activation of the growth-factorreceptor-tyrosine-kinase signalling pathway (such as through overexpression of PDGF / PDGFR) initiates tumour formation, whereas disruption of the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway contributes to the progression of tumour development. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.",
  "The body gets energy through the oxidation of food such as glucose and fatty acids. The chemical energy contained in these foods is extracted and converted until it reaches a common form, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable and is coupled to a variety of energetically unfavorable processes to drive them forward. How is the energy of glucose captured and converted to make ATP? Most of the energy of glucose or fatty acids is extracted through oxidation to produce the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. From there, the energy is transferred next to the electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chain includes a series of protein complexes and non-membrane cofactors that transfer the electrons from NADH and FADH2 in a series of redox reactions from carrier to carrier. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the chain, resulting in the production of water. The oxygen we breath, and which is transported by hemoglobin in the blood to all of the tissues, serves this purpose and allows electron transport to occur. As the electrons pass through the chain, they transfer their energy to",
  "Hypertrophy associated with both hypertension and obstruction to ventricular outflow leads to pathologic cardiac growth and it is associated with increase morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic ventricular disease takes a growing toll on the health of nations. As other cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infraction are in decline as causes of mortality, the heart failure problem becomes increasingly urgent. Congenital heart defects occur in 1% of live births and fetal heart malformations are implicated in many pregnancies that end in still-birth or spontaneous abortion. The current paradigm suggests that the heart adapts to excess of hemodynamic loading by compensatory hypertrophy, which under condition of persistent stress, over time evolves into dysfunction and myocardial failure. There is considerable evidence that direct effects of increased mechanical stress are sensed within the ventricular wall and that signals critical for the generation of growth responses. Despite compelling statistics we still do not understand biochemically why heart defects are so prevalent. A single transcriptional regulator initially associated with the activation of the T-cells",
  "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units and form proteglycans by covalently attaching to their core proteins. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit GalNAc (b1-4) GlcA (b1-3), modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates. CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues. The assembly process of CS is initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization step is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both b13 glucuronosyltransferase and b14 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O sulfation and 6-O sulfation of N-",
  "The cellular activation of the caspase cascade resulting in cell death is triggered by chemical damage to DNA which stimulates a sequence resulting in the cleavage of Bid in a manner similar to the binding of so called death-receptors or directly initiates the permeability transition of the mitochondrial membrane. The permiability transition releases several factors including cytochrome c, AIF and other factors in to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase cascade. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death.",
  "Hypoxic stress, like DNA damage, induces p53 protein accumulation and p53-dependent apoptosis in oncogenically transformed cells. Unlike DNA damage, hypoxia does not induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, suggesting that p53 activity is differentially regulated by these two stresses. Hypoxia induces p53 protein accumulation, but in contrast to DNA damage, hypoxia fails to induce endogenous downstream p53 effector mRNAs and proteins, such as p21, Bax, CIP1, WAF1 etc. Hypoxia does not inhibit the induction of p53 target genes by ionizing radiation, indicating that p53-dependent transactivation requires a DNA damage-inducible signal that is lacking under hypoxic treatment alone. The phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. Mdm-2 targets the p53 tumor suppressor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome, but, in addition, the p53 transcription",
  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. Generally, lymphocyte adhesion and passage from the bloodstream to the lymphatic system occurs in the high endothelial venules of the lymphnodes. This way the lymphocytes can communicate with each other in the lymphatic system and search for foreign compounds after their recirculation to the bloodstream, this fulfilling their role in the immune system. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flatteningof the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or",
  "The vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is a highly specialized cell whose principal function is contraction. On contraction, VSMCs shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure. The principal mechanisms that regulate the contractile state of VSMCs are changes in cytosolic Ca2 + concentration (c). In response to vasoconstrictor stimuli, Ca2 + is mobilized from intracellular stores and / or the extracellular space to increase c in VSMCs. The increase in c, in turn, activates the Ca2 + -CaM-MLCK pathway and stimulates MLC20 phosphorylation, leading to myosin-actin interactions and, hence, the development of contractile force. The sensitivity of contractile myofilaments or MLC20 phosphorylation to Ca2 + can be secondarily modulated by other signaling pathways. During receptor stimulation, the contractile force is greatly enhanced by the inhibition of myosin phosphatase. Rho / Rho kinase, PKC, and arachidonic acid have been proposed to play a pivotal role in this enhancement. The signaling events that mediate relaxation include the removal of a contractile agonist (passive relaxation) and activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in the continued presence of a",
  "A key part of the immune system is the production of immunoglobulins (antibodies) by B cells to bind and inactivate specific foreign antigens. The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4 + T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD4",
  "Skeletal muscle atrophies with disuse while with increased use and increased load skeletal muscle exhibits hypertrophy, with an increase in the size of existing muscle fibers. One signaling pathway involved in regulating skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy is the AKT / mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway activity increases in response to muscle activity during hypertrophy and decreases in activity during atrophy. Blocking this pathway genetically or with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks hypertrophy and genetic activation of the pathway induces hypertrophy. One agent that promotes muscle hypertrophy is the growth factor IGF-1. IGF-1 activates AKT, GSK-3beta and mTOR to promote hypertrophy. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway is not involved in hypertrophy and is down-regulated by agents such as IGF-1 that promote hypertrophy. Calcineurin may modulate other aspects of muscle function such as the development of slow muscle fibers through transcriptional regulation. These pathways lead to regulation of protein translation, with increased translation apparently acting as a key regulatory point in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Agents such as IGF-1 that stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy may provide treatments for muscle atrophy and wasting.",
  "A demonstrated means to increase lifespan in a wide range of organisms is through the restriction of caloric intake. Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in early defenses against both allogeneic (nonself) cells and autologous cells undergoing various forms of stress, such as infection with viruses, bacteria, or parasites or malignant transformation. Although NK cells do not express classical antigen receptors of the immunoglobulin gene family, such as the antibodies produced by B cells or the T cell receptor expressed by T cells, they are equipped with various receptors whose engagement allows them to discriminate between target and nontarget cells. Activating receptors bind ligands on the target cell surface and trigger NK cell activation and target cell lysis. However Inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I molecules (HLA) and inhibit killing by NK cells by overruling the actions of the activating receptors. This inhibitory signal is lost when the target cells do not express MHC class I and perhaps also in cells infected with virus, which might inhibit MHC class I exprssion or alter its conformation. The mechanism of NK cell killing is the same as that used by the cytotoxic T cells generated in an adaptive immune response; cytotoxic granules are released onto the surface of the bound",
  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein identified genetically as an important developmental factor. Shh provides a morphogenic signal in the developing CNS, organizing the spatial patterning of cells in the midbrain and inducing proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum, neural tube and retina. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Sonic hedgehog signaling may proceed by more than one mechanism. One signaling pathway is activated by Shh binding to Patched (Ptc-1) which releases inhibition of the GPCR Smoothened, activating the Shh signaling pathway and allowing progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Shh can also affect progression through the G2 / M transition. Patched binds to phosphorylated Cyclin B1, one component of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), along with the kinase Cdc2. The interaction of Cyclin B1 with Patched blocks MPF activity, blocking progression through the G2 / M transition. Shh binding leads to degradation of Ptc-1, release of Cyclin B1, and entry of the cyclin B1 into the nucleus. Pat",
  "Progesterone (Pg) binds to both intracellular iPR and plasma membrane- bound mPR. (Right Top) After binding to Pg, iPR is recruited to the membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase p60c- src, which induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in activation of p90Rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Myt1, which favors formation of the activated cell cycle complex cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 causes breakdown of the germinal vesicle and the initiation of oocyte maturation. (Left). In contrast, binding of Pg to mPR leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through activation of Gi or inhibition of Gs. This leads to a decrease in the cAMPdependent kinase PKA, which relieves inhibition of Cdc25C (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cyclin B-Cdc2) and also indirectly promotes the activation of MAPK signaling. PKA also regulates the initiation of oocyte maturation through other effects that are independent of PKA activity.",
  "The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of three sites (ser 112,136 and 155). Phosphorylation at these sites results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. While ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with the activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. BAD Ser 155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors.",
  "The transcription factor CREB binds the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and activates transcription in response to a variety of extracellular signals including neurotransmitters, hormones, membrane depolarization, and growth and neurotrophic factors. Protein kinase A and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CaMKII stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, a key regulatory site controlling transcriptional activity. Growth and neurotrophic factors also stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133. Phosphorylation occurs at Ser133 via p44 / 42 MAP Kinase and p90RSK and also via p38 MAP Kinase and MSK1. CREB exhibit deficiencies in spatial learning tasks, while flies overexpressing or lacking CREB show enhanced or diminished learning, respectively.",
  "Reliable neurotransmitter release requires the presence of sufficent numbers of synaptic vesicles. The process of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) is coordinated by a group of proteins called dephosphins. The current set of seven known dephosphins are nerve treminal proteins with little or no structural hoimology but satisfy two essential criteria: they are essential for SVE and they are rapidly and coordinately dephosphorlyated in response to a calcium influx through voltage-dependent calicium channels. The calicium signal is mediated by calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin. Each dephosphin plays an essential role in overlapping phases or segments of the cycle. The four phases of SVE are nucleation, invagination, fission and uncoating. In this diagram the internalization of the vesicle is the uncoating step. In order to illustrate the complexity of this process the initial display of the protein is labelled with a name and a number. This number is then used at the decloaking or uncoating step to show the release and seperation of the various factors. Each step in the process has a different set of complex components. The",
  "One of responses to increased blood pressure is cardiac hypertrophy through increased size of ventricular myocardial cells leading to increased thickness of the ventricular walls. Cardiac hypertrophy allows the heart to handle the increased stress caused by elevated blood pressure but is also a risk factor associated with heart disease. Cardiac hypertrophy results from cross-talk between G-protein coupled receptor signaling and the EGF receptor pathway. Several GPCR ligands are known to stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, including factors that regulate blood pressure such as angiotensin II and endothelin- 1. These factors stimulate phospholipase C through Gq activation, and the production of 1P3 and diacylglycerol second messengers. PKC-delta is activated by DAG and interacts with the metalloproteinase ADAM12. ADAM12 cleaves the membrane-bound HB-EGF to release soluble EGF ligand that activates EGF receptor in myocardial cells. EGF receptor activation downstream through small G proteins and the MAP kinase pathway ultimately leads to cardiac hypertrophy. Signals by GPCR ligands such as angiotensin II result in transcriptional translation of immediate early genes like fos and other genes involved in long-term remodeling of heart tissue and the physiological response to stress in the heart such as the atrial natriuretic",
  "The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in macrophages are activated by their peptide ligands and also by the HIV envelope protein GP120 during HIV infection. One mechanism of signaling by these GPCRs is through activation of Gi signaling. These chemokine receptors can also signal through a Gi-independent pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. This pathway elevates calcium influx into the cell through CRAC channels, ion channels that are activated by calcium release. Elevated calcium from CRAC is required for downstream activation of Pyk2, a focal adhesion-associated protein kinase. Non Gi signaling by these chemokine receptors also involves the Jnk and p38 Map kinase pathways leading to AP-1 activation and activation of genes such as MIP-1 and MCP-1. This pathway may be involved in the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of AIDS.",
  "Neutrophils respond to bacterial infection by releasing reactive oxygen species that kill bacteria and by expressing chemokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection. The multisubunit enzyme NADPH oxidase expressed by neutrophils produces reactive oxygen species rapidly released in what is known as the respiratory burst. Activity of the NADPH oxidase is induced by fMLP receptor ligands, formylated peptides from bacteria. The fMLP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, FPR-1, that activates Map kinase pathways and phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation releases IP3 and calcium, activating protein kinase C and also activating the transcription factor NFAT, which contributes to activation of chemokine genes. One of the components of the NADPH oxidase is p47phox. PKC activation phosphorylates p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase activity. Activation of Map kinase cascades leads to Erk1 / Erk2 dependent p47phox phosphorylation as well as activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and chemokine gene expression. Inhibition of p38 did not affect p47phox phosphorylation, indicating that p38 is not involved in Erk1 / 2 activation of the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of p38 did inhibit",
  "Ca2 + that enters the cell from the outside is a principal source of signal Ca2 +. Entry of Ca2 + is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2 + by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2 + fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2 + -entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs). The other principal source of Ca2 + for signalling is the internal stores that are located primarily in the endoplasmic / sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER / SR), in which inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RYRs) regulate the release of Ca2 +. The principal activator of these channels is Ca2 + itself and this process",
  "The protein export is the active transport of proteins from the cytoplasm to the exterior of the cell, or to the periplasmic compartment in Gram-negative bacteria. The sec dependent pathway is the general protein export system that transports newly synthesized proteins into or across the cell membrane. The translocation channel is formed from a conserved trimeric membrane protein complex, called the Sec61 / SecY complex. The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is another protein transport system that transports folded proteins in bacteria, archaea, and chloroplasts. Many Tat systems comprise three functionally different membrane proteins, TatA, TatB, and TatC, but TatA and TatE seem to have overlapping functions, with TatA having by far the more important role.",
  "CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor in the GPCR gene family, and is expressed by cells in the immune system and the central nervous system. In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role",
  "Corepressors are coregulators that interact with transcriptional silencers in a variety of pathways such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Abnormal corepressor-silencer interactions have been implicated in a variety of human disease pathways including several types of leukemia. The regulation of the SMRT corepressor via the p38 and Mek-1 Kinase pathway is shown in this diagram. The EFG receptor represents one mechanism by which SMRT function is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. The MEKK1 and p38 pathways are activated by EGF resulting in cross-regulation of SMRT. The induction of SMRT phosphorylation by each pathway is shown, causing SMRT to unbind from the transcription factor complexes represented by RXR, RAR, T3R and PLZF.",
  "Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps known as G1 and G2 phases. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage, the checkpoint kinase ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. p5",
  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein identified genetically as an important developmental factor. Shh provides a morphogenic signal in the developing CNS, organizing the spatial patterning of cells in the midbrain and inducing proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum, neural tube and retina. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Sonic hedgehog signaling may proceed by more than one mechanism. One signaling pathway is activated by Shh binding to Patched (Ptc-1) which releases inhibition of the GPCR Smoothened, activating the Shh signaling pathway and allowing progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Shh can also affect progression through the G2 / M transition. Patched binds to phosphorylated Cyclin B1, one component of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), along with the kinase Cdc2. The interaction of Cyclin B1 with Patched blocks MPF activity, blocking progression through the G2 / M transition. Shh binding leads to degradation of Ptc-1, release of Cyclin B1, and entry of the cyclin B1 into the nucleus. Pat",
  "Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. This classification has also been justified at the molecular level with Type 1 tumours being more commonly associated with abnormalities of DNA-mismatch repair genes, K-ras, PTEN and beta-catenin, and Type 2 tumours with abnormalities of p53 and HER2 / neu.",
  "Xenopus oocytes are naturally arrested at G2 of meiosis I. Exposure to either insulin / IGF-1 or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks this arrest and induces resumption of the two meiotic division cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg. This process is termed oocyte maturation. The transition is accompanied by an increase in maturation promoting factor (MPF or Cdc2 / cyclin B) which precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Most reports point towards the Mos-MEK1-ERK2 pathway and the polo-like kinase / CDC25 pathway as responsible for the activation of MPF in meiosis, most likely triggered by a decrease in cAMP.",
  "Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells",
  "Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt / Ca2 + pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2 + signalling is mediated through",
  "One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",
  "After transcription, eukaryotic mRNA precursors contain protein-coding exons and noncoding introns. In the following splicing, introns are excised and exons are joined by a macromolecular complex, the spliceosome. The standard spliceosome is made up of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, and several spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs). Spliceosomes are not a simple stable complex, but a dynamic family of particles that assemble on the mRNA precursor and help fold it into a conformation that allows transesterification to proceed. Various spliceosome forms (e.g. A-, B- and C-complexes) have been identified.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a14) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and / or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.",
  "Insulin binding to its receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (INSR). This allows association of IRSs with the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which activates Akt, a serine kinase. Akt in turn deactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), leading to activation of glycogen synthase (GYS) and thus glycogen synthesis. Activation of Akt also results in the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles from their intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, where they allow uptake of glucose into the cell. Akt also leads to mTOR-mediated activation of protein synthesis by eIF4 and p70S6K. The translocation of GLUT4 protein is also elicited through the CAP / Cbl / TC10 pathway, once Cbl is phosphorylated by INSR. Other signal transduction proteins interact with IRS including GRB2. GRB2 is part of the cascade including SOS, RAS, RAF and MEK that leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitogenic responses in the form of",
  "Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) are composed of at least three types of transmembrane protein -occludin, claudin and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) - and a cytoplasmic 'plaque' consisting of many different proteins that form large complexes. The transmembrane proteins mediate cell adhesion and are thought to constitute the intramembrane and paracellular diffusion barriers. The cytoplasmic 'plaque' contains three major multi-protein complexes consisting largely of scaffolding proteins, the ZO protein complex, the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ complex and the PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex. The ZO protein complex appears to organize the transmembrane proteins and couple them to other cytoplasmic proteins and to actin microfilaments. Two evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, the CRB3 and PAR complexes are involved in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. Besides these three protein complexes which seem to be constitutively associated at TJs, a number of proteins with different functions has been identified at TJs. These include additional scaffolding proteins like MUPP1 and MAGI-1, adaptor proteins, transcription regulators and RNA processing factors, regulatory proteins like small GTPases and G-proteins, kinases",

  "The epidermis, which provides a protective barrier that undergoes a constant renewal, is a multi-layered tissue with the proliferating cells located in the basal layer. As cells leave the basal layer the underog significant differentiation, biochemical and morphological remodeling. The final differentiation results in the formation of corneocytes. In vitro keratinocytes mimic this process. Several genes mark keratinocyte specific differentiation. Among the most frequently tracked markers are Transglutaminase, Cystatin and Involucrin. The keratinocyte differentiation studies have identified and provided significant detail regarding the involvement of three of the 4 major MAP kinase pathways from several diverse stimuli such as EGF, FAS, TNF and Calicium influx. The p38 cascade is represented twice since both p38alpha (p38) and p38delta (MAPK13) are involved. The keratinocyte differentiation cascased also provide for detailed study of the functions of individual PKC isoforms. It is interesting to note the contrasting functions of the PKC isoforms in this process. In recent studies it has been determined that the cPKC (conventional / classical Protein Kinase C) isoforms, which are calcium-",
  "Hypoxic stress, like DNA damage, induces p53 protein accumulation and p53-dependent apoptosis in oncogenically transformed cells. Unlike DNA damage, hypoxia does not induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, suggesting that p53 activity is differentially regulated by these two stresses. Hypoxia induces p53 protein accumulation, but in contrast to DNA damage, hypoxia fails to induce endogenous downstream p53 effector mRNAs and proteins, such as p21, Bax, CIP1, WAF1 etc. Hypoxia does not inhibit the induction of p53 target genes by ionizing radiation, indicating that p53-dependent transactivation requires a DNA damage-inducible signal that is lacking under hypoxic treatment alone. The phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. Mdm-2 targets the p53 tumor suppressor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome, but, in addition, the p53 transcription",
  "Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2 / TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP) / TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) / TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to",
  "The calcium / calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are involved in a large number of cellular responses induced by hormones, neurotransmitters and other signalling. Elevation of calcium functions as a major second messenger, where the intracellular concentration of calcium can be maintained at extremely low levels and susequently increased following specific calcium-mobilizing stimuli. There are many buffers to the calcium fluxuations including membrane pumps and calcium-binding proteins that create discrete spatial control of its effectors and their targets. The current family of multifunctional calcium / calmodulin (CaM) -dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) consists of CaMKI, CaMKII and CaMKIV. These kinases translate and co-ordinate the calcium fluxuations into the appropriate cellular responses via phosphorylation. These kinases are partially regulated by the intracellular calcium receptor calmodulin (CaM), have common as well as unique features in their structure, regulation and activation. CaMKII, CaMKI and CaMKIV, have an autoregulatory domain that restricts or inhibits enzymic activity in the absence of calcium / CaM. Calcium / CaM binding alone produces maximal activity of CaMKII, whereas CaMKI and CaMKIV have an activation loop",
  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs coincides with the recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases, including c-Src, Hck and c-Fgr (Src-TK), to the receptor-arrestin complex. Several signaling events have been reported to involve -arrestin-dependent Src recruitment. These include the regulation of clathrin-dependent 2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis by tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, Ras-dependent activation of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade and stimulation of cell proliferation by 2-adrenergic and neurokinin NK1 receptors, and stimulation of chemokine CXCR1 receptor-mediated neutrophil degranulation",

  "One of the major tasks of the renal proximal tubule (PT) is to secrete acid into the tubule lumen, thereby reabsorbing approximately 80% of the filtered bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)), as well as generating new HCO3 (-) for regulating blood pH. In the tubular lumen, filtered HCO3 (-) combines with H (+) in a reaction catalyzed by CA IV. The CO2 thus produced rapidly diffuses into the tubular cells and is combined with water to produce intracellular H (+) and HCO3 (-), catalyzed by soluble cytoplasmic CA II. HCO3 (-) is then cotransported with Na (+) into blood via the NBC-1. The intracellular H (+) produced by CA II is secreted into the tubular lumen predominantly via the NHE-3. The PT creates the new HCO3 (-) by taking glutamine and metabolizing it to two molecules each of NH4 (+) and HCO3 (-). The NH4 (+) is excreted into the tubular lumen, and the HCO3 (-), which is new HCO3 (-), is returned to the blood",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting foreign DNA from invading microbes or host cells and generating innate immune responses. DAI is the first identified sensor of cytosolic DNA which activates the IRF and NF- {kappa} B transcription factors, leading to production of type I interferon and other cytokines. The second type of cytoplasmic DNA sensor is AIM2. Upon sensing DNA, AIM2 triggers the assembly of the inflammasome, culminating in interleukin maturation. In addition to these receptors, there is a mechanism to sense foreign DNA, with the host RNA polymerase III converting the DNA into RNA for recognition by the RNA sensor RIG-I. These pathways provide various means to alert the cell.",
  "Bile acids are steroid carboxylic acids derived from cholesterol in vertebrates. The primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are synthesized in the liver and conjugated with taurine or glycine before secretion via bile into the intestine. The conversion from cholesterol to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids involves four steps: 1) the initiation of synthesis by 7alpha-hydroxylation of sterol precursors, 2) further modifications to the ring structures, 3) side-chain oxidation and shortening (cleavage) by three carbons, and 4) conjugation of the bile acid with taurine or glycine.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an example of lipid messengers with both intracellular and extracellular functions. Intracellularly S1P regulates proliferation and survival; extracellularly S1P is a ligand for EDG1 (also known as S1P1). Activation of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, increases cellular levels of S1P. Inhibitors of SPHK block formation of S1P and inhibit cellular proliferation induced by a variety of factors, including as an example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PMA. In a study using endothelial cells it was demonstrated that S1P induces activation of alpha-v and B3 integrins via RhoA. S1P also activates Akt via Gi and PI3K. The activated Akt phosphorlyates the Edg1 receptor on threonine 236 leading to the activation of Rac1 and subsequent signals leading to actin assembly, chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation. Edg1 stimulation also leads to the activation of the ERK signaling cascade resulting in anti-apoptotic reversal, proliferation and cell survival.",
  "Myocardial infraction (MI) is the condition of irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle that results from prolonged ischemia. Nearly 1.5 million people in US sustain an MI each year, and this event proves fatal in approximately one third of patients. Approximately 90% of MI result from formation of an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The thrombus transforms a region of plaque narrowing to one of complete vessel occlusion (top right in pink). The responsible thrombus appears to be generated by interactions between the atherosclerotic plaque, the coronary endothelium, circulating platelets, and dynamic vasomotor tone of the vessel wall, all of which overwhelm natural protective mechanisms. The endogenous protective mechanisms against thrombosis include: 1. Inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III (ATIII), the effectiveness of which is enhanced by binding of ATIII to heparin sulafate. The antithrombin binding region of commercial heparin consists of sulfated disaccharide units (bottom panel). 2. Inactivation of clotting factors Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (protein C *), an action that is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombomodulin (TM)",
  "Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the",
  "Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a) is a tissue-specific coactivator that enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors and coordinates transcriptional programs important for energy metabolism and energy homeostasis. Inappropriate increases in PGC-1a activity have been linked to a number of pathological conditions including heart failure and diabetes. PGC-1a is highly expressed in metabolically active tissues including brown fat, skeletal muscle and heart. PGC-1a has been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart and increased mitochondrial respiration in brown fat. PGC-1a is a coactivator for many factors including, CBP, Scr-1, PPARa, GR (glucocorticoid receptor), THR (thyroid hormone receptor), several orphan receptors and MEF2. This pathway illustrates two of the cofactor regulatory factors MEF2 and PPARa) and an example orphan receptor feedback inhibition loop.

  "Primary immunodeficiencies (PIs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which affect cellular and humoral immunity or non-specific host defense mechanisms mediated by complement proteins, and cells such as phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. These disorders of the immune system cause increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy. Most of PIs are due to genetic defects that affect cell maturation or function at different levels during hematopoiesis. Disruption of the cellular immunity is observed in patients with defects in T cells or both T and B cells. These cellular immunodeficiencies comprise 20% of all PIs. Disorders of humoral immunity affect B-cell differentiation and antibody production. They account for 70% of all PIs.",
  "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are essential for neuromuscular signaling and are also expressed in non-neuronal tissues, where their function is less clear. Although nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are primarily known for their action as ligand-gated ion channels transducing action potentials across synapses, they may have other actions. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in neurons alter apoptotic signaling, protecting against cell death in some settings, and this action may in some cases be directed through alternative signaling pathways. In neurons the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor activates PI3 kinase through a src-family kinase, activating the anti-apoptotic kinase AKT. One pathway involved in AKT signaling involves phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, causing its retention in the cytoplasm associated with 14-3-3, and blocking expression of the apoptotic fas protein. The PI3 kinase / AKT pathway protects a broad range of neurons against apoptotic cell death and may block apoptosis triggered by beta-amyloid fragments that contributes to the progression of Alzheimers disease. If so, nicotinic agents may prove useful in the treatment of this and other neurodegenerative conditions. There are several proteins that modulate the response of nicotinic acetylcholine",
  "Nitric oxide (NO) has a number of important physiological actions in the cardiovascular system. In the heart, NO plays role in keeping the vessels patent via vasodilation and prevention of platelet aggregation. It also plays an important role in regulating the force and rate of contraction. In vivo NO is released by shear stress of ligands that increase intracellular Ca2 + in endothelial cells. The increase intracellular Ca2 + activates nitric oxide synthase III (NOSIII) by promoting the binding of Ca / Calmodulin to the enzyme. NOSIII, which is resident in the Golgi complex, is transported together with caveolin-1 to the caveolae at the plasma membrane via vesicles. Shear stress signals via a potassium channel and the cytoskeleton, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequently in activation of Akt kinase. Akt activation by shear stress but also by VEGF activates NOSIII by serine phosphorylation, which increases the affinity of NOSIII for calmodulin. After agonist binding at the plasma membrane, NOSIII-activating receptors translocate to caveolae. VEGF receptor signals via its tyrosine kinase domain. Furthermore, agonist",

  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVD / C. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt / beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger",
  "The complement system is part of the defense against invading cells and is composed of about twenty different proteins found in the plasma. When activated, complement proteins form a pathway of proteolytic reactions that culminates in the lysis of foreign cells. The complement system also stimulates phagocytosis of foreign cells and an inflammatory response. There are two different complement systems, the classical complement pathway initiated by antibody complexes on the cell surface, and an alternative complement pathway that is initiated without antibodies. The complement system proteins are named with a capital C followed by a number. A small letter after the number indicates that the protein is a smaller protein resulting from the cleavage of a larger precursor by a protease. In the classical pathway, the first step is the initiation of the pathway triggered by recognition by complement factor C1 of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface. When C1 complex interacts with aggregates of IgG with antigen on a cell's surface, two C1-associated proteases, C1r and C1s, are activated. Other factors like lipopolysaccharide also activate C1s. Once C1s is activated, it cleaves C4 to form C4b that then binds to the cell",
  "One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin proteins form pores in the membranes of the attacked cell, allowing the entry of Granzyme A and Granzyme B. Granzyme B induces caspase activation and cleavage of factors like ICAD, releasing DFF40 to fragment DNA, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Granzyme A is also an abundant granzyme released by cytotoxic T cells and is important in cytotoxic T cell induced apoptosis, activating caspase independent pathways. Once in a cell, Granzyme A activates DNA nicking by the recently identified DNAse NM23-H1, a tumor suppressor gene product whose expression is reduced in transformed, metastatic cells. The previous identification of NM23-H1 as a tumor suppressor indicates that its DNAse activity plays an important role in immune surveillance to prevent cancer through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of NM23-H1 occurs indirectly, through the cleavage of proteins that inhibit NM23-H1 in the SET complex, which includes SET, Ape1, pp32 and",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR has three subtypes (PPARalpha, beta / delta, and gamma) showing different expression patterns in vertebrates. Each of them is encoded in a separate gene and binds fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPARalpha plays a role in the clearance of circulating or cellular lipids via the regulation of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. PPARbeta / delta is involved in lipid oxidation and cell proliferation. PPARgamma promotes adipocyte differentiation to enhance blood glucose uptake.",
  "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals primarily through the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). The activities of IL-1 include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and roles in arthritis and septic shock. The inflammatory activities of IL-1 are partially derived by transcriptionally inducing expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interferons, as well as inducing the expression of other inflammation-related genes. There are two forms of IL-1 encoded by distinct genes, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta is produced as a 269 amino acid precursor that is cleaved by IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) to the active IL-1 beta form that is secreted. IL-1 signaling is opposed by the naturally occurring peptide IL-1 receptor antagonist which is a therapeutic agent for the treatment of arthritis. The type 1 IL-1 receptor protein binds IL-1 beta but requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to transduce a signal. IL-1 binding",
  "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), two neuropeptides present in the lymphoid microenvironment, elicit a broad spectrum of biological functions, including the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Another important immunoregulatory function of VIP and PACAP is their inhibition effect on AICD in T cells. They inhibit the TCR-stimulated FasL expression and apoptosis of T cell through specific receptors and induction of intracellular cAMP. VIP down-regulate c-Myc synthesis, the NF-AT-dependent Egr2 and Egr3 expression, the NF-AT and NF-kB.",
  "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in physiological blood vessel formation and pathological angiogenesis such as tumor growth and ischemic diseases. Hypoxia is a potent inducer of VEGF in vitro. The increase in secreted biologically active VEGF protein from cells exposed to hypoxia is partly because of an increased transcription rate, mediated by binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) to a hypoxia responsive element in the 5 '-flanking region of the VEGF gene. bHLH-PAS transcription factor that interacts with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), and its predicted amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1a) product. HLF mRNA expression is closely correlated with that of VEGF mRNA.. The high expression level of HLF mRNA in the O2 delivery system of developing embryos and adult organs suggests that in a normoxic state, HLF regulates gene expression of VEGF, various glycolytic enzymes, and others driven by the HRE sequence, and may be involved in development of blood vessels and the tubular system of lung. VEGF expression is dramatically induced by hypoxia due in large part to an increase in the stability",

  "Cytokines are soluble extracellular proteins or glycoproteins that are crucial intercellular regulators and mobilizers of cells engaged in innate as well as adaptive inflammatory host defenses, cell growth, differentiation, cell death, angiogenesis, and development and repair processes aimed at the restoration of homeostasis. Cytokines are released by various cells in the body, usually in response to an activating stimulus, and they induce responses through binding to specific receptors on the cell surface of target cells. Cytokines can be grouped by structure into different families and their receptors can likewise be grouped.",
  "A key part of the immune system is the production of immunoglobulins (antibodies) by B cells to bind and inactivate specific foreign antigens. The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4 + T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD4",
  "Xenopus oocytes are naturally arrested at G2 of meiosis I. Exposure to either insulin / IGF-1 or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks this arrest and induces resumption of the two meiotic division cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg. This process is termed oocyte maturation. The transition is accompanied by an increase in maturation promoting factor (MPF or Cdc2 / cyclin B) which precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Most reports point towards the Mos-MEK1-ERK2 pathway and the polo-like kinase / CDC25 pathway as responsible for the activation of MPF in meiosis, most likely triggered by a decrease in cAMP.",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF / CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF / CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the Endo",
  "TACI and BCMA signal transduction pathway that enhances cell survival APRIL and BAFF (also called TALL-I and BLyS) are TNF family members that act as ligands for the BCMA and TACI receptors. Both APRIL and BAFF bind to both the BCMA and TACI receptors to activate the humoral immune response, stimulating B cell immunoglobulin production and proliferation. BAFF is found as a membrane bound form in T cells and a soluble form that is released from the cell to stimulate B cell proliferation and differentiation. As members of the TNF receptor gene family, BCMA and TACI interact with TRAF family members to transduce signals downstream to NF-kappaB activation and MAP kinase pathways. Abnormally active BAFF or APRIL signaling may play a role in autoimmune disorders such as lupus.",
  "After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",
  "Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) are composed of at least three types of transmembrane protein -occludin, claudin and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) - and a cytoplasmic 'plaque' consisting of many different proteins that form large complexes. The transmembrane proteins mediate cell adhesion and are thought to constitute the intramembrane and paracellular diffusion barriers. The cytoplasmic 'plaque' contains three major multi-protein complexes consisting largely of scaffolding proteins, the ZO protein complex, the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ complex and the PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex. The ZO protein complex appears to organize the transmembrane proteins and couple them to other cytoplasmic proteins and to actin microfilaments. Two evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, the CRB3 and PAR complexes are involved in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. Besides these three protein complexes which seem to be constitutively associated at TJs, a number of proteins with different functions has been identified at TJs. These include additional scaffolding proteins like MUPP1 and MAGI-1, adaptor proteins, transcription regulators and RNA processing factors, regulatory proteins like small GTPases and G-proteins, kinases",
  "Hypertrophy associated with both hypertension and obstruction to ventricular outflow leads to pathologic cardiac growth and it is associated with increase morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic ventricular disease takes a growing toll on the health of nations. As other cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infraction are in decline as causes of mortality, the heart failure problem becomes increasingly urgent. Congenital heart defects occur in 1% of live births and fetal heart malformations are implicated in many pregnancies that end in still-birth or spontaneous abortion. The current paradigm suggests that the heart adapts to excess of hemodynamic loading by compensatory hypertrophy, which under condition of persistent stress, over time evolves into dysfunction and myocardial failure. There is considerable evidence that direct effects of increased mechanical stress are sensed within the ventricular wall and that signals critical for the generation of growth responses. Despite compelling statistics we still do not understand biochemically why heart defects are so prevalent. A single transcriptional regulator initially associated with the activation of the T-cells",
  "The function of hemoglobin in oxygen transport by red blood cells requires precise assembly of a tetramer of two beta-subunits and two alpha-units. If too many beta-subunits are present, then all tetramers of beta-subunits are formed that bind oxygen but do not release it when needed. When alpha-subunits are in excess they form precipitates with oxidized heme that damage red blood cells. Red blood cells require a precise coregulation of alpha and beta subunit expression to maintain the proper ratio of the subunits and normal red blood cell function. Generally red blood cells express slightly more alpha than beta-subunits to avoid forming unproductive beta-tetramers (HbH). The slight excess of alpha units are blocked from precipitation by a molecular chaperone, AHSP, alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein. Expression of the AHSP gene is coordinately activated with the globin genes and heme biosynthesis genes by the GATA-1 gene involved in erythrocyte differentiation. AHSP blocks precipitation of alpha-units, and promotes the formation of normal productive alpha-beta tetramers (HbA). People with mutation or deletion of the beta-subunit gene have Beta-thalasse",
  "RhoA is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell morphology via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. The majority of RhoA activations is due to disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell morphology. RhoA is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. The RhoGAP ARHGAP1 also acts as a GAP for Rac and CDC42. Active RhoA increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several different factors downstream of RhoA act on cytoskeletal structures to affect stability of these structures. Rock1 provides a direct link from RhoA to cell morphology through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Rock1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses this activity. According to Nimnual et al. Rho activity is reduced as a result of Rac-induced redox-dependent inhibition. Related Disease: Non-syndromic deafness appears to be",
  "Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that can lead to development of Th2 cells. The 140 kD IL-4 Receptor (CD124) is found on many cell types, even those of non-hematopoietic origen. The receptor is formed from two chains: IL-4R (alpha) and the IL-2R gamma chain (CD132). Primary signaling is through the JAK / Stat6 pathway and MAPKs.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a14) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and / or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an example of lipid messengers with both intracellular and extracellular functions. Intracellularly S1P regulates proliferation and survival; extracellularly S1P is a ligand for EDG1 (also known as S1P1). Activation of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, increases cellular levels of S1P. Inhibitors of SPHK block formation of S1P and inhibit cellular proliferation induced by a variety of factors, including as an example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PMA. In a study using endothelial cells it was demonstrated that S1P induces activation of alpha-v and B3 integrins via RhoA. S1P also activates Akt via Gi and PI3K. The activated Akt phosphorlyates the Edg1 receptor on threonine 236 leading to the activation of Rac1 and subsequent signals leading to actin assembly, chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation. Edg1 stimulation also leads to the activation of the ERK signaling cascade resulting in anti-apoptotic reversal, proliferation and cell survival.",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "Several different cell types coordinate their efforts as part of the immune system, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. Each of these cell types has a distinct role in the immune system, and communicates with other immune cells using secreted factors called cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, and the interferons. Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and are antigen-presenting cells, using cytokines to stimulate specific antigen dependent responses by B and T cells and non-specific responses by other cell types. T cells secrete a variety of factors to coordinate and stimulate immune responses to specific antigen, such as the role of helper T cells in B cell activation in response to antigen. The proliferation and activation of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils respond to cytokines as well. Cytokine communication is often local, within a tissue or between cells in close proximity. Each of the cytokines is secreted by one set of cells and provokes a response in another target set of cells, often including the cell that secretes the cytokine. Some cytokines, like IL-1, interferons and TNF, stimulate a broad inflammatory response in response to infection or injury.",
  "The cellular activation of the caspase cascade resulting in cell death is triggered by chemical damage to DNA which stimulates a sequence resulting in the cleavage of Bid in a manner similar to the binding of so called death-receptors or directly initiates the permeability transition of the mitochondrial membrane. The permiability transition releases several factors including cytochrome c, AIF and other factors in to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase cascade. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death.",
  "Hypoxia (or low O2 levels) affects various pathologies. First, tissue ischemia, a variation in O2 tension caused by hypoxia / reoxygenation, can lead to endothelial cell changes. For example, long periods of ischemia result in endothelial changes, such as vascular leakage, resulting in varicose veins. In more severe situations, ischemia can lead to myocardial or cerebral infarction and retinal vessel occlusion. Of interest, HIF-1 is stabilized prior to induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression during acute ischemia in the human heart. Second, pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic respiratory disorders results from persistent vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. Third, hypoxic gradients created in enlarging solid tumors trigger expression of genes containing hypoxia response element (HRE) s such as those involved in angiogenesis. This allows subsequent delivery of O2, nutrients, and further tumor growth. Vascular remodeling is an important component to tumorigenesis; without proper blood supply, delivery of oxygen may occur by diffusion, but becomes inefficient in tumors greater than 1 mm in diameter. Short-term hypoxia can also elevate platelet numbers, while prolonged exposure may cause some degree of thrombocytopenia in response to increased levels of erythropo",
  "Nine currently identified phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-K) constitute a subfamily of lipid kinases that catalyze the addition of a phosphate molecule on the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), the precursor of all phosphoinosi-tides (PI), constitutes less than 10% of the total lipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. Approximately 5% of cellular PI is phosphorylated at the 4-position (PtdIns-4-P), and another 5% is phosphorylated at both the 4- and 5-positions (PtdIns-4,5-P2). However, less than 0.25% of the total inositol-containing lipids are phosphorylated at the 3-position, consistent with the idea that these lipids exert specific regulatory functions inside the cell, as opposed to a structural function. Here we have chosen to highlight a group of the phosphoinositide targets of the PI3-Ks and their downstream targets. The downstream effects of these PI-3 targets are indicated in the lower band illustrating the important role the PI3Ks have in cell function and survival.",
  "Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in eukaryotic cellular processes. It mainly functions as a signal for 26S proteasome dependent protein degradation. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins being degraded is performed by a reaction cascade consisting of three enzymes, named E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). Each E3 has specificity to its substrate, or proteins to be targeted by ubiquitination. Many E3s are discovered in eukaryotes and they are classified into four types: HECT type, U-box type, single RING-finger type, and multi-subunit RING-finger type. Multi-subunit RING-finger E3s are exemplified by cullin-Rbx E3s and APC / C. They consist of a RING-finger-containing subunit (RBX1 or RBX2) that functions to bind E2s, a scaffold-like cullin molecule, adaptor proteins, and a target recognizing subunit that binds substrates.",
  "Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK",
  "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are essential for neuromuscular signaling and are also expressed in non-neuronal tissues, where their function is less clear. Although nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are primarily known for their action as ligand-gated ion channels transducing action potentials across synapses, they may have other actions. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in neurons alter apoptotic signaling, protecting against cell death in some settings, and this action may in some cases be directed through alternative signaling pathways. In neurons the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor activates PI3 kinase through a src-family kinase, activating the anti-apoptotic kinase AKT. One pathway involved in AKT signaling involves phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, causing its retention in the cytoplasm associated with 14-3-3, and blocking expression of the apoptotic fas protein. The PI3 kinase / AKT pathway protects a broad range of neurons against apoptotic cell death and may block apoptosis triggered by beta-amyloid fragments that contributes to the progression of Alzheimers disease. If so, nicotinic agents may prove useful in the treatment of this and other neurodegenerative conditions. There are several proteins that modulate the response of nicotinic acetylcholine",
  "The process of hematopoesis is regulated by various cytokines. The combination of cytokines stimulates the proliferation and / or differentiation of the various hematopoietic cell types. Bone marrow stromal cells are the major source of hematopoietic cytokines in the non-infecteous state. In the presence of infection, cytokines produced by activated macrophages and TH cells induce hematopoietic activity. The induction by cytokines results in rapid expansion of the population of white blood cells to fight infection. The specific cytokines that affect a step of cell differentiation are placed adjacent to the arrow representing that step. Lines with '?' indicate likely, but still hypothetical pathways.",

  "Activation of T lymphocytes is a key event for an efficient response of the immune system. It requires the involvement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD28. Engagement of these receptors through the interaction with a foreign antigen associated with major histocompatibility complex molecules and CD28 counter-receptors B7.1 / B7.2, respectively, results in a series of signaling cascades. These cascades comprise an array of protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, GTP-binding proteins and adaptor proteins that regulate generic and specialised functions, leading to T-cell proliferation, cytokine production and differentiation into effector cells.",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to infection by the immune system that requires communication between different classes of immune cells to coordinate their actions. Acute inflammation is an important part of the immune response, but chronic inappropriate inflammation can lead to destruction of tissues in autoimmune disorders and perhaps neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disease. Secreted cytokine proteins provide signals between immune cells to coordinate the inflammatory response. Some cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF act to broadly provoke the inflammatory response while others act on specific types of immune cells. Macrophages and other phagocytotic cells provide a front-line defense against bacterial infection. Macrophages stimulate the inflammatory responses of neutrophils, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in response infection by secreting IL-1 and TNF. IL-1 and TNF cause fever through alteration of the body temperature set-point in the hypothalamus. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to IL-1 and TNF by recruiting more immune cells to the site of inflammation. Secreted IL-8 is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils to sites of infection. Macrophages also present antigen to T helper cells that play a central role in coordinating immune responses. T helper cells induce clonal",
  "Cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs), the most common type of intercellular adhesions, are important for maintaining tissue architecture and cell polarity and can limit cell movement and proliferation. At AJs, E-cadherin serves as an essential cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cytoplasmic tail binds beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is associated with F-actin bundles directly and indirectly. The integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of beta-catenin by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Fer, Fyn, Yes, and Src), which leads to dissociation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Integrity of this complex is positively regulated by beta -catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase II, and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Changes in the phosphorylation state of beta-catenin affect cell-cell adhesion, cell migration and the level of signaling beta-catenin. Wnt signaling acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin by inhibiting beta-catenin degradation, which stabilizes beta-catenin, and causes its accumulation. Cadherin may acts as a negative regulator",
  "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in 11 genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2 + sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2 + concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM",
  "The T Cell Receptor plays a key role in the immune system. The specificity of the receptor is governed by the binding site formed from the mature alpha and beta chains (shown here) or gamma and delta chains in gamma / delta T Cells. It is the ability of this receptor to bind a complex of foreign peptide in the groove of an MHC molecule that leads to T cell activation. Upon activation the T cell can assist in activating other cells or carry out cytolytic attacks depending on the particular T cell type. The CD3 complex and CD4 (Th cells) or CD8 (Tc cells) work to transmit the activation signal to the T cell's transcriptional machinary upon engagement of the receptor.",
  "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha (PKA-RIIa) is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP350 (also known as AKAP450 and CGNAP), MAP2 and Pericentrin. This diagram illustrates these three PKA-RII binding complexes. The cyclin B-p34 (cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate PKA-RIIa on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of PKA-RIIa at the on set of mitosis. It has been demonstrated that PKA-RIIa dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The focal point of this illustration is the AKAP350 complex. In addition to binding PKA-RIIa, AKAP350 binds PKN (Takahashi et al 1999) and the phosphatases PP1 and PPA2 (Takahashi et al 1999). PKN is a serine / threonine protein kinase, having a catalytic domain homologous to the PKC family in the C-terminal region and a unique",
  "Mitochondria participate in apoptotic signaling pathways through the release of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase pathway. Smac / DIABLO is released from mitochondria and inhibits IAP proteins that normally interact with caspase-9 to inhibit apoptosis. Apoptosis regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins occurs as family members form complexes that enter the mitochondrial membrane, regulating the release of cytochrome c and other proteins. TNF family receptor that cause apoptosis directly activate the caspase cascade, but can also activate Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, which activates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Bax, another Bcl-2 family member, is activated by this pathway to localize to the mitochondrial membrane and increase its permeability, releasing cytochre c and other mitochondrial proteins. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent pore formation, blocking apoptosis. AIF (Apoptosis inducing factor) is another mitochondrial factor that is released into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis. AIF-induced",
  "Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that stimulates neuronal survival and growth through TrkA, a member of the trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors that also includes TrkB and TrkC. Some NGF responses are also mediated or modified by p75LNTR, a low affinity neurotrophin receptor. Binding of NGF to TrkA stimulates neuronal survival, and also proliferation. Pathways coupled to these responses are linked to TrkA through association of signaling factors with specific amino acids in the TrkA cytoplasmic domain. Cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis is signaled through activation of PI3-kinase and AKT. Ras-mediated signaling and phospholipase C both activate the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate proliferation.",
  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVD / C. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt / beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger",
  "Helper T cells are found in two distinct cell types, Th1 and Th2, distinguished by the cytokines they produce and respond to and the immune responses they are involved in. Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-g, TNF-b and IL-2, while Th2 cells produce the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. The cytokines produced by Th1 cells stimulate the phagocytosis and destruction of microbial pathogens while Th2 cytokines like IL-4 generally stimulate the production of antibodies directed toward large extracellular parasites. IL-5 stimulates eosinophil responses, also part of the immune response toward large extracellular parasites Th1 and Th2 are produced by differentiation from a non-antigen exposed precursor cell type, Thp. Exposure of Thp cells to antigen by antigen-presenting cells may result in their differentiation to Th0 cells, not yet committed to become either Th1 or Th2 cells, although the existence of Th0 cells is controversial. Cells committed as either Th1 and Th2 cells are called polarized, whether they are effector cells actively secreting cytokines or are memory cells. The stimulation of Thp cells",
  "NK (natural killer) cells are lymphocytes distinct from B and T cells that induce perforin-mediated lysis of tumor cells and virus-infected cells. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is activated by glycoproteins on the cell surface (activating receptors) and inhibited by MHC-1 with self-peptide bound. The MHC-1 inhibitory signal through Ig-family or lectin receptors prevents NK cells from killing normal cells. Abnormal MHC-1 expression in infected or tumor cells results in the release of perforin, the lysis of the abnormal cell and the release of cytokines that stimulate the immune response. MAP kinase inhibitors but not ras inhibitors are able to block NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating that the pathway can function by a ras-independent manner that involves the MAP kinase pathway. This pathway includes phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) as a key component, followed by Rac1 and the exchange factor Vav. The tyrosine kinase SYK and LAT may provide an additional pathway for activation of MAP kinases leading to NK cell activation, and also Pyk-2 activation by integrins. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 appears to mediate the cytotoxicity inhibitory signal that blocks lysis",
  "Physical interactions between intergrin alpha4beta1 heterodimer expressed on B cells and counter receptors on stroma cells are key mediators of the survival of normal and malignant B cells. Recent data indicate that integrin stimulation increases FBI-1, XIAP, surviving, and CCT4 expression but inhibits Requiem, c-Fos, and caspase 3 and 7 induction.",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The extrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to vascular walls or extravascular tissues. The damaged tissue releases tissue thromboplastin also known as tissue factor (TF). The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes as little as 15 seconds. This cascade is initiated by the activation of factor X by TF and factor VII. Activated factor X combined with factor V, factor VII and TF constitutes the prothrombin activator. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for each of these steps. The prothrombin activator in the extrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the intrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also the step leading to the activation of factor X. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin. Protein",
  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein identified genetically as an important developmental factor. Shh provides a morphogenic signal in the developing CNS, organizing the spatial patterning of cells in the midbrain and inducing proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum, neural tube and retina. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Sonic hedgehog signaling may proceed by more than one mechanism. One signaling pathway is activated by Shh binding to Patched (Ptc-1) which releases inhibition of the GPCR Smoothened, activating the Shh signaling pathway and allowing progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Shh can also affect progression through the G2 / M transition. Patched binds to phosphorylated Cyclin B1, one component of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), along with the kinase Cdc2. The interaction of Cyclin B1 with Patched blocks MPF activity, blocking progression through the G2 / M transition. Shh binding leads to degradation of Ptc-1, release of Cyclin B1, and entry of the cyclin B1 into the nucleus. Pat",
  "The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle",
  "RhoA is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell morphology via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. The majority of RhoA activations is due to disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell morphology. RhoA is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. The RhoGAP ARHGAP1 also acts as a GAP for Rac and CDC42. Active RhoA increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several different factors downstream of RhoA act on cytoskeletal structures to affect stability of these structures. Rock1 provides a direct link from RhoA to cell morphology through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Rock1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses this activity. According to Nimnual et al. Rho activity is reduced as a result of Rac-induced redox-dependent inhibition. Related Disease: Non-syndromic deafness appears to be",
  "Signaling by interferon-gamma stimulates anti-viral responses and tumor suppression through the heterodimeric interferon-gamma receptor. Signaling is initiated by binding of interferon-gamma to its receptor, activating the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate STAT transcription factors that activate interferon responsive genes. Molecular chaperones that modulate or alter protein folding interact with different components of the interferon signaling pathway. One chaperone that modulates interferon signaling is hTid-1, a member of the DnaJ family of chaperones and a cochaperone for the heat shock protein Hsp70, another molecular chaperone. hTid-1 was found in a two-hybrid screen to bind to JAK2 and also to interact with the interferon-gamma receptor. In addition, hTid-1 and JAK2 also interact with Hsp70. Overexpression of hTid-1 represses transcriptional activation by interferon-gamma and Hsp70 dissociates from these proteins when interferon is added to cells, suggesting that Hsp70 holds Jak2 in an inactive conformation prior to ligand activation, and is released in the presence of agonist to allow the activation of Jak-2 and downstream pathway",
  "One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin proteins form pores in the membranes of the attacked cell, allowing the entry of Granzyme A and Granzyme B. Granzyme B induces caspase activation and cleavage of factors like ICAD, releasing DFF40 to fragment DNA, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Granzyme A is also an abundant granzyme released by cytotoxic T cells and is important in cytotoxic T cell induced apoptosis, activating caspase independent pathways. Once in a cell, Granzyme A activates DNA nicking by the recently identified DNAse NM23-H1, a tumor suppressor gene product whose expression is reduced in transformed, metastatic cells. The previous identification of NM23-H1 as a tumor suppressor indicates that its DNAse activity plays an important role in immune surveillance to prevent cancer through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of NM23-H1 occurs indirectly, through the cleavage of proteins that inhibit NM23-H1 in the SET complex, which includes SET, Ape1, pp32 and",
  "All taste pathways are proposed to converge on common elements that mediate a rise in intracellular Ca2 + followed by neurotransmitter release. Na + salt depolarizes taste cells by passive influx of Na + through the amiloride-sensitive Na + channel (ENaC). Acids depolarize taste cells by a variety of mechanisms, including influx of protons (H +) through ENaC and a proton-gated cation channel (MDEG). Two putative umami receptors have been identified: a truncated variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 and the heterodimer, T1R1 + T1R3. Umami receptors are coupled to a signaling pathway involving activation of PLCbeta2, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activation of a transient receptor potential channel, TRPM5. Bitter compounds, such as denatonium and PROP, activate particular T2R / TRB isoforms, which activate gustducin heterotrimers. Activated alpha-gustducin stimulates PDE to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas betagamma subunits activate PLCbeta2 to generate IP3, which leads to release of Ca2 + from internal stores. Artificial sweeteners activate GPCRs (",
  "The calcium / calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are involved in a large number of cellular responses induced by hormones, neurotransmitters and other signalling. Elevation of calcium functions as a major second messenger, where the intracellular concentration of calcium can be maintained at extremely low levels and susequently increased following specific calcium-mobilizing stimuli. There are many buffers to the calcium fluxuations including membrane pumps and calcium-binding proteins that create discrete spatial control of its effectors and their targets. The current family of multifunctional calcium / calmodulin (CaM) -dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) consists of CaMKI, CaMKII and CaMKIV. These kinases translate and co-ordinate the calcium fluxuations into the appropriate cellular responses via phosphorylation. These kinases are partially regulated by the intracellular calcium receptor calmodulin (CaM), have common as well as unique features in their structure, regulation and activation. CaMKII, CaMKI and CaMKIV, have an autoregulatory domain that restricts or inhibits enzymic activity in the absence of calcium / CaM. Calcium / CaM binding alone produces maximal activity of CaMKII, whereas CaMKI and CaMKIV have an activation loop",
  "Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor, which binds to a serum response element (SRE) associated with a variety of genes including (i) immediate early genes such as c-fos, fosB, junB, egr-1 and -2, (ii) neuronal genes such as nurr1 and nur77, and (iii) muscle genes such as actins and myosins. By regulating expression of these genes, SRF controls cell growth and differentiation, neuronal transmission as well as muscle development and function. SRF can be activated by serum, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), agents that increase intracellular Ca2 +, T-cell virus1 activator protein, hepatitis B virus activator proteins pX, activated oncogenes and protooncogenes and extracellular stimuli such as antioxidant and UV light. In serum-starved cells, MAL is predominantly cytoplasmic where it is sequestered by actin monomers. Upon serum stimulation, Rho becomes active and, through its interaction with ROCK and",
  "The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters form one of the largest known protein families, and are widespread in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. They couple ATP hydrolysis to active transport of a wide variety of substrates such as ions, sugars, lipids, sterols, peptides, proteins, and drugs. The structure of a prokaryotic ABC transporter usually consists of three components; typically two integral membrane proteins each having six transmembrane segments, two peripheral proteins that bind and hydrolyze ATP, and a periplasmic (or lipoprotein) substrate-binding protein. Many of the genes for the three components form operons as in fact observed in many bacterial and archaeal genomes. On the other hand, in a typical eukaryotic ABC transporter, the membrane spanning protein and the ATP-binding protein are fused, forming a multi-domain protein with the membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD).",
  "The G1 / S cell cycle checkpoint controls the passage of eukaryotic cells from the first 'gap' phase (G1) into the DNA synthesis phase (S). Two cell cycle kinases, CDK4 / 6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E, and the transcription complex that includes Rb and E2F are pivotal in controlling this checkpoint. During G1 phase, the Rb-HDAC repressor complex binds to the E2F-DP1 transcription factors, inhibiting the downstream transcription. Phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4 / 6 and CDK2 dissociates the Rb-repressor complex, permitting transcription of S-phase genes encoding for proteins that amplify the G1 to S phase switch and that are required for DNA replication. Many different stimuli exert checkpoint control including TGFb, DNA damage, contact inhibition, replicative senescence, and growth factor withdrawal. The first four act by inducing members of the INK4 or Kip / Cip families of cell cycle kinase inhibitors. TGFb additionally inhibits the transcription of Cdc25A, a phosphatase that activates the cell cycle kinases. Growth factor withdrawal activates GSK3b, which phosphorylates cyclin D, leading to its rapid ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation.",
  "Exposure to divalent cadmium ions (Cd2 +) is a known cancer risk factor, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inappropriate induction of cellular proliferation by cadmium are still being figured out. One cellular model used to study this process is macrophages grown in culture. In cultured macrophages, cadmium acts both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm to induce proliferation. At the cell surface, cadmium interacts with a pertussis-sensitive cell surface receptor, probably a Gi-coupled GPCR, to stimulate proliferation. Cadmium can enter cells through calcium ion channels and once in cells affects calcium release by the ER. In addition to changes in intracellular calcium, the proliferative effects of cadmium are mediated by the Ras / Map kinase pathway, and also NF-kB. Inhibition of phospholipase C, map kinases, or NF-kB with a variety of pharmacological inhibitors all blocked the activation of cellular proliferation by cadmium. Protein kinase C is also activated by cadmium, upstream of the Map kinase pathway. Changes in transcription induced by cadmium include induction of immediate early genes like fos, jun, and myc. In addition to inducing cellular proliferation, cadmium also is slightly genotoxic",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "Role of -arrestins in the desensitization, sequestration and intracellular trafficking of GPCRs. Homologous desensitization of GPCRs (1) results from the binding of -arrestins (-arr) to agonist -occupied receptors following phosphorylation of the receptor by GRKs. -arrestin binding sterically precludes coupling between the receptor and heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to termination of signaling by G proteins effectors. Receptor-bound -arrestins also act as adapter proteins, binding to components of the clathrin endocytic machinery including clathrin, 2-adaptin (AP-2). Receptor sequestration (2) reflects the dynamin (Dyn) -dependent endocytosis of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits. Once internalized, GPCRs exhibit two distinct patterns of -arrestin interaction. `Class A 'GPCRs, for example the 2 adrenergic receptor, rapidly dissociate from -arrestin upon internalization. These receptors are trafficked to an acidified endosomal compartment, wherein the ligand is dissociated and the receptor dephosphorylated by a GPCR-specific protein phosphatase PP2A isoform, and are subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane (3). `Class B' receptors, for example the angiotensin II AT1a receptor, form stable receptor--arrestin",

  "Liver is the major site for carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis and glycogen synthesis) and triglyceride synthesis (lipogenesis). While insulin was long thought to be the major regulator of hepatic gene expression, emerging evidence show that nutrients, in particular, glucose and fatty acids, are also able to regulate hepatic genes. This diagram illustrates how glucose metabolite, rather than glucose itself, contributes to the coordinated regulation of carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis in liver through phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ChREBP (carbohydrate responsive element binding protein). ChREBP is a basic helix-loop helix / leucine zipper (bHLH / LZ) transcription factor, shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a glucose-responsive manner in hepatocytes. When serum glucose is elevated, glucose transporter (GLUT2) and glucokinase (GCK) allow for rapid uptake and equilibration of intracellular glucose levels. This flux of glucose promotes, via the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway (HMP Shunt), the formation of xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu-5-P), which activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to dephosphorylate ChREBP (Ser196) and promote its nuclear localization. PP2A",
  "Over 1,000 papers and reviews have been written about the role of ceramide in the production of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Ceramide is a sphingosine-based lipid-signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This diagram represents some of the current understanding of the cascades that couple ceramide to specific signaling pathways. These cascades illustrate that ceramide can be a growth stimulus or proapototic signal. The ultimate ceramide action is determined within the context of other stimuli and by the subcellular topology of its production and is cell-type specific. There are 2 forms of sphingomyelinase, acid (acid-sphingomyelinase: A-SMase) and neutral (neutral-sphingomyelinase N-SMase), that can produce ceramide. TNF-alpha can stimulate either form of sphingomyelinase as can other death receptors. Different domanis of TNF-alpha stimulate the different Smases. N-SMase stimulation is enhanced by the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1). The activity of each form is dependent on the local intracellular pH. In the illustration the forms are seperated to reduce confusion however",
  "Classically, colorectal cancer (CRC) has been believed to develop from normal mucosa through the premalignant adenoma by the step-wise accumulation of mutations. All CRC display either microsatellite instability (MSI) or chromosome instability (CIN). MSI occurs in 15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system by either MMR gene mutations or hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. MSI promotes tumorigenesis through generating mutations in target genes that possess coding microsatellite repeats, such as beta-catenin, TGFBR2 and BAX. CIN is found in the majority of colon cancers and leads to a different pattern of gene alterations that contribute to tumor formation. Genes involved in CIN are those coding for APC, K-ras, SMAD4 and p53.",

  "BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified genetically as breast cancer susceptibility genes when a single copy of the gene is mutated and are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, including blocking cell cycle progression and inducing DNA repair to preserve the integrity of the genome during cell division. BRCA1 and BRCA2 induce double-stranded repair of breaks using homologous recombination, in part through activation of RAD51. BRCA1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase targeting the protein FancD2 that activates checkpoint control, integrating the ATM response to ionizing radiation and the FA response to cross-linking agents like mitomycin C. Mutation of one of the several components of the FA complex involved in maintaining integrity of the genome leads to the condition Fanconi anemia. One member of the FA complex was recently identified as BRCA2, which leads to Fanconi anemia when both copies of the gene are mutated. Another related factor involved in the response of cells to DNA damage is the kinase ATM. ATM is mutated in patients with AT, a condition with many similar traits to Fanconi anemia. Like ATM, ATR serves as a checkpoint kinase that halts cell cycle progression and induces DNA repair when DNA is damaged. Loss",
  "Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2 / neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) show elevated expression of EGF receptors (e.g. HER2 / neu) and their ligands (e.g.TGF-alpha) consistent with the presence of this autocrine loop. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.",
  "Peroxisomes are essential organelles that play a key role in redox signalling and lipid homeostasis. They contribute to many crucial metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, biosynthesis of ether lipids and free radical detoxification. The biogenesis of peroxisomes starts with the early peroxins PEX3, PEX16 and PEX19 and proceeds via several steps. The import of membrane proteins into peroxisomes needs PEX19 for recognition, targeting and insertion via docking at PEX3. Matrix proteins in the cytosol are recognized by peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS) and transported to the docking complex at the peroxisomal membrane. Peroxisomes' deficiencies lead to severe and often fatal inherited peroxisomal disorders (PD). PDs are usually classified in two groups. The first group is disorders of peroxisome biogenesis which include Zellweger syndrome, and the second group is single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies.",
  "eIF-4F and p70 S6 kinase play critical roles in translational regulation. eIF-4F is a complex whose functions include the recognition of the mRNA 5 'cap structure (eIF-4E), delivery of an RNA helicase to the 5' region (eIF-4A), bridging of the mRNA and the ribosome (eIF-4G), and circularization of the mRNA via interaction between eIF-4G and the poly (A) binding protein (PABP). Several stimuli, including growth factors and cytokines, regulate the eIF-4 complex and p70 S6 kinase by initiating a phosphorylation cascade involving the sequential activation of PI3-K, PDK1 / 2, Akt / PKB, and FRAP / mTOR kinase. FRAP / mTOR, together with an unidentified kinase, phosphorylates 4E-BP, leading to its dissociation from and activation of eIF-4E. MNK1 / 2, activated by ERK and p38 MAPK, phosphorylates and activates eIF-4E. Both processes contribute to the association of eIF-4E and eIF-4G to form the active eIF-4F complex, a necessary component of the 48S initiation",
  "The Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway involving eight enzymes essential for energy production through aerobic respiration, and, like glycolysis, arose early in evolution. This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl",
  "For a T cell to be activated by a specific antigen, the T cell receptor must recognize complexes of MHCI with the antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. T cells and the T cell receptor complex do not respond to antigen in solution, but even for the specific antigen they only respond to antigen-MHC-1 complexes on the cell surface. This interaction is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. T cell activation also requires a co-stimulatory signal involving interaction of CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 family genes) on the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 activates a signal transduction pathway acting through PI-3K, Lck and Grb-2 / ITK to provide its co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation. Another means to control T cell activation is by expressing factors that down-regulate T cell activation. Signaling by activated T cell receptors induces expression of CTLA-4, a receptor that opposes T cell activation. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity than CD28 for B7 proteins, terminating T cell activation.",
  "Cysteine and methionine are sulfur-containing amino acids. Cysteine is synthesized from serine through different pathways in different organism groups. In bacteria and plants, cysteine is converted from serine (via acetylserine) by transfer of hydrogen sulfide. In animals, methionine-derived homocysteine is used as sulfur source and its condensation product with serine (cystathionine) is converted to cysteine. Cysteine is metabolized to pyruvate in multiple routes. Methionine is an essential amino acid, which animals cannot synthesize. In bacteria and plants, methionine is synthesized from aspartate. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), synthesized from methionine and ATP, is a methyl group donor in many important transfer reactions including DNA methylation for regulation of gene expression. SAM may also be used to regenerate methionine in the methionine salvage pathway.",
  "Her2 or ERBB2 belongs to a class of proteins having high homology with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ERBB1). It encodes a protein with the molecular weight of 185 KDa. Unlike other members of EGFR family, no ligand for Her2 has been found and it usually associates with members of ERBB1 family to form functional heterodimers. It has been shown that it can form dimers with ERBB (EGFR), ERBB3 and ERBB4 as well as gp130 subunits of IL-6 receptor. In at least some cell types, the association between gp130 and HRBB2 is essential for HRBB2-ERBB3 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP kinase signaling. Although ERBB1 can form homodimers, the signaling for ERBB1 is usually transient and the receptor undergoes internalization after ligand binding and activation. EGFR-HER2 complex increases the signaling capacity of EGFR by increasing the ligand affinity as well as the recycling of the heterodimer. Of all the ERBB heterodimers, ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimers perhaps elicit the strongest signal. Removing ERBB3 from the cell has a drastic effect on ERBB2 mediated signaling and downstream effectors. The",
  "Cell adhesion molecules are (glyco) proteins expressed on the cell surface and play a critical role in a wide array of biologic processes that include hemostasis, the immune response, inflammation, embryogenesis, and development of neuronal tissue. There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. Membrane proteins that mediate immune cellcell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions are important for brain morphology and highly coordinated brain functions such as memory and learning. During early development of the nervous system, neurons elongate their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of cell-cell adhesions. Cell-cell adhesions also underpin axon-axon contacts and link neurons with supporting schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.",
  "Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the control of translation by eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). eIF-2 binds GTP and Met-tRNAi and transfers the Met-tRNA to the 40S subunit, to form the 43S preinitiation complex. Later in the cycle, prior to elongation, the bound GTP is hydrolyzed, releasing eIF-2-GDP. For eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, GDP must be exchanged for GTP, a reaction catalyzed by eIF-2B. Kinases activated by viral infection (PKR), endoplasmic reticulum stress (PERK / PEK), amino acid deprivation (GCN2), and hemin deficiency (HRI) can phosphorylate the a subunit of eIF-2. This phosphorylation stabilizes the eIF-2-GDP-eIF-2B complex, inhibiting the turnover of eIF-2B. eIF-2B is also inhibited by GSK-3b phosphorylation. These events result in a shut-down of cellular protein synthesis and can lead to apoptosis.",
  "Myocardial infarction damages heart tissue both during the initial ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion of tissues with oxygen. Corticosteroids can protect cardiac tissue from damage following a heart attack, but the mechanisms by which corticosteroids are cardioprotective have not been clear and negative side effects such as reduced wound healing may result from their use. Corticosteroids exert a variety of actions through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. GR acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, but some of the cardioprotective effects mediated by GR-bound corticosteroids are non-transcriptional in nature. Glucocorticoids are commonly used as anti-inflammatory drugs in a variety of conditions, and some of their effects in the heart result from inhibition of the inflammatory response of heart tissue to ischemia and reperfusion. NF-kB is a transcription factor involved in signaling by inflammatory factors such as TNF, and is repressed by glucocorticoids. Annexin-1 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein whose expression is induced by corticosteroids and inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into tissue, blocking reperfusion-induced inflammatory heart damage. A non-transcriptional cardioprotective effect of glucocorticoids is activation of",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) provide a potent proliferative signaling system that stimulates growth in many different cell types and blocks apoptosis. In vivo IGF-1 acts as an intermediate of many growth hormone responses, and may stimulate the growth of some types of cancer. IGF-1 also provides a mitogenic signal to act as a growth factor for many tissue culture cells. One component of IGF-1 mitogenic signaling is association of the receptor tyrosine kinase with Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1 to activate ras and the Map kinase cascade (raf, Mek, Erk). An endpoint of the Map kinase pathway is modification of transcription factor activity, such as activation of ELK transcription factors. Serum response factor (SRF) and AP-1 contribute to mitogenic signaling by many factors. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI3 kinase activation are also involved in IGF-1 signaling, similar to insulin signaling.",
  "Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage.",
  "The calcium / calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are involved in a large number of cellular responses induced by hormones, neurotransmitters and other signalling. Elevation of calcium functions as a major second messenger, where the intracellular concentration of calcium can be maintained at extremely low levels and susequently increased following specific calcium-mobilizing stimuli. There are many buffers to the calcium fluxuations including membrane pumps and calcium-binding proteins that create discrete spatial control of its effectors and their targets. The current family of multifunctional calcium / calmodulin (CaM) -dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) consists of CaMKI, CaMKII and CaMKIV. These kinases translate and co-ordinate the calcium fluxuations into the appropriate cellular responses via phosphorylation. These kinases are partially regulated by the intracellular calcium receptor calmodulin (CaM), have common as well as unique features in their structure, regulation and activation. CaMKII, CaMKI and CaMKIV, have an autoregulatory domain that restricts or inhibits enzymic activity in the absence of calcium / CaM. Calcium / CaM binding alone produces maximal activity of CaMKII, whereas CaMKI and CaMKIV have an activation loop",
  "Inflammation is a complex response involving many different cells and signaling molecules, including the secretion of the cytokine IL-17 by activated T cells. IL-17 secretion is restricted to specific subsets of T cells but the receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed throughout the body, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders. Fibroblasts and other cells stimulated by IL-17 are induced themselves to secrete inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). These cytokines in turn provoke a range of activities, including the stimulation of neutrophil proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The complement pathway consists of a series of over thirty proteins in plasma that are part of the immune response. Activation of the complement system lyses bacterial cells, forms chemotactic peptides (C3a and C5a) attracting immune cells, and increases phagocytotic clearance of infecting cells. Complement can also increase the permeability of vascular walls and cause inflammation. Most complement proteins exist in plasma as inactive precursors that cleave and activate each other in a proteolytic cascade in response to three different mechanisms by which the complement system is activated, the classical pathway, the alternative pathway and the lectin-induced pathway. These three systems are distinct in the initiation of the proteolytic cascade but share most of their components and all three converge in the creation of a C3 convertase that cleaves the C3 complement protein, leading ultimately to the formation of the membrane attack complex, MAC, a pore causing lysis of cells. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of foreign cells by antibodies bound to the surface of the cells. The alternative and lectin-induced pathways are both antibody independent. Proteolysis is triggered in the alternative pathway by the spontaneous activation of C3 convertase from C3 and is triggered",
  "B cells are an important component of adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete millions of different antibody molecules, each of which recognizes a different (foreign) antigen. The B cell receptor (BCR) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta. After BCR ligation by antigen, three main protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) -the SRC-family kinase LYN, SYK and the TEC-family kinase BTK- are activated. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma 2) are important downstream effectors of BCR signalling. This signalling ultimately results in the expression of immediate early genes that further activate the expression of other genes involved in B cell proliferation, differentiation and Ig production as well as other processes.",
  "The IL-2 receptor is a key component of immune signaling and is required for the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. This receptor is composed of three polypeptide chains, the alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2 receptor gamma chain is a common component for several other cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. The IL-2 receptor beta chain is essential for IL-2 signaling and is also a component of the IL-15 receptor complex. The polypeptides of the IL-2 receptor do not themselves have intrinsic catalytic activity, but interact with cytoplasmic signaling proteins to transduce signals. br > Different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor beta chain interact and couple with distinct signaling pathways and cellular responses. JAK1 associates with the beta chain, and JAK3 with the gamma chain. Binding of IL-2 induces heterodimerization of receptor subunits, and activation of JAK kinase activity. Tyrosine residues in the beta chain cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated during activation, recruiting other factors to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues through src homology 2 (SH2) domains",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an example of lipid messengers with both intracellular and extracellular functions. Intracellularly S1P regulates proliferation and survival; extracellularly S1P is a ligand for EDG1 (also known as S1P1). Activation of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, increases cellular levels of S1P. Inhibitors of SPHK block formation of S1P and inhibit cellular proliferation induced by a variety of factors, including as an example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PMA. In a study using endothelial cells it was demonstrated that S1P induces activation of alpha-v and B3 integrins via RhoA. S1P also activates Akt via Gi and PI3K. The activated Akt phosphorlyates the Edg1 receptor on threonine 236 leading to the activation of Rac1 and subsequent signals leading to actin assembly, chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation. Edg1 stimulation also leads to the activation of the ERK signaling cascade resulting in anti-apoptotic reversal, proliferation and cell survival.",
  "Classically, colorectal cancer (CRC) has been believed to develop from normal mucosa through the premalignant adenoma by the step-wise accumulation of mutations. All CRC display either microsatellite instability (MSI) or chromosome instability (CIN). MSI occurs in 15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system by either MMR gene mutations or hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. MSI promotes tumorigenesis through generating mutations in target genes that possess coding microsatellite repeats, such as beta-catenin, TGFBR2 and BAX. CIN is found in the majority of colon cancers and leads to a different pattern of gene alterations that contribute to tumor formation. Genes involved in CIN are those coding for APC, K-ras, SMAD4 and p53.",
  "The cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. This transition is regulated by the checkpoint kinase cdk2 that activates the G1 to S transition when it is associated with cyclin E. Cdk2 / Cyclin E causes the G1 to S transition through phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor Rb, releasing the transcription factor E2F-1. Other pathways acting through Rac, Ras and Rho also regulate the G1 to S transition. Ras regulates cyclin D1 expression to affect the G1 to S transition. Transforming forms of Ras or Raf induce cyclin D1 expression and cause early entry into S phase. Signaling from Ras to Raf to MEK to ERKs induces Cyclin D1 expression, allowing Cyclin D1 to complex with Cdk4 and Cdk6 and phosphorylate Rb. Rac-1 and PAK appear to induce Cyclin D1 expression and induce the G1 to S transition primarily through activation of NF-kB to activate the Cyclin D1 promoter. Rho activates cdk2 and also inhibits p21 and p27 to induce cyclin D1 and stimulate the G1 to S transition. Rho represses p21 expression to block p21 induction by Ras and to allow Ras induced progression",
  "Serine is derived from 3-phospho-D-glycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, and glycine is derived from serine. Threonine is an essential amino acid, which animals cannot synthesize. In bacteria and plants, threonine is derived from aspartate.",
  "The A-kinase anchor protein 13 (AKAP13, also known as AKAP-LBC) is one of a group of structurally diverse proteins, which have the common function of binding to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell. AKAP13 is a splice variant of the oncogene Lbc. Alternative splicing of the AKAP13 gene results in at least 3 transcript variants encoding different isoforms containing a Dbl oncogene homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain is associated with guanine nucleotide exchange activation for the Rho / Rac family of small GTP binding proteins, resulting in the conversion of the inactive GTPase to the active form capable of transducing signals. The PH domain has multiple functions. These splice variants contain a fragment that was originally identified as Ht31 which acts as a scaffolding protein to regulate the Rho signaling pathway and as protein kinase A-anchoring protein creating a coordination of these two signalling pathways. Diviani et al. found that in HEK293 cells LPA induced stimulation preferentially",
  "The most recognized mechanism by which peroxisome proliferators regulated gene expresssion is through a PPAR / RXR heterodimeric complex binding to a peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) (classical mechanism). However, there are the possibility of several variations on this theme: 1). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR that preexists as a DNA complex with associated corepressors proteins. The interaction with ligand causes release of the corepressor and association with a coactivator, resulting in the classical mechanism. 2). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR as a soluble member of the nucleus. The binding of ligand results in RXR heterodimerization, DNA binding and coactivator recruitment. 3). In this scenario, PPAR exists in the cytosol, perhaps complexed to heat shock protein 90 and / or other chaperones. Binding of peroxisome proliferator causes a conformational change and translocation into the nucleus. Scenarios 4 and 5 require regulation of gene expression via non-classical mechanisms: 4). PPAR is capable of interacting with, and forming DNA binding heterodimers with, several nuclear receptors including the thyroid hormone receptor. The binding site for this non-RXR heterodimer need",
  "Endocytosis is a mechanism for cells to remove ligands, nutrients, and plasma membrane (PM) proteins, and lipids from the cell surface, bringing them into the cell interior. Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type.",
  "A key part of the immune system is the production of immunoglobulins (antibodies) by B cells to bind and inactivate specific foreign antigens. The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4 + T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD4",
  "The molecular events that lead to the perception of pain are a key research field in medicine and drug discovery. The opioid receptors modulate pain signaling in response to endogenous peptide ligands and opiate drugs such as morphine. The kappa opioid receptor plays a key role in the profound analgesia of opiates and is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand dynorphin, encoded by the prodynorphin gene. Production of prodynorphin is transcriptionally regulated by a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the prodynorphin gene. A transcription factor called DREAM (DRE antagonistic modulator) binds to the DRE and represses prodynorphin transcription when bound. DREAM binds calcium with 4 EF-hand motifs and the binding of DREAM to DNA is repressed in the presence of calcium. Many transcription factors are regulated by calcium indirectly through calcium sensitive kinases and phosphatases, but DREAM is unique to date in being a transcription factor that directly binds calcium and is regulated by calcium binding. DREAM may also regulate other genes such as c-fos. DREAM is expressed in spinal cord neurons in regions involved in pain signaling. The regulation of prodynorphin expression by DREAM also leads to the hypothesis that DREAM is involved in pain signaling",
  "Many cell-surface receptors induce production of second messengers like PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, that convey signals to the cytoplasm from the cell surface. PIP3 signals activates the kinase PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, which in turn activates the kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B. Proteins phosphorylated by activated AKT promote cell survival. Phosphorylation of Ikappa-B kinase leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-kB to oppose apoptosis. Bad is a protein in the Bcl-2 gene family that opposes Bcl-2 to induce apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Bad by AKT blocks anti-apoptotic activity to promote cell survival. Similarly, phosphorylation of the protease caspase 9 or forkhead transcription factors by AKT block the induction of apoptosis by these factors. AKT promotes cell survival and opposes apoptosis by a variety of routes.",
  "Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF / CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF / CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the Endo",
  "Chemokine receptors expressed by T helper cells help recruit cells to specific locations based on their chemoattractant ligands. The polarization of T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells is associated with their expression of different subsets of chemokine receptors. Naive CD4 positive cells that have not been exposed to antigen express CXCR4 and CCR7. The most abundant chemokine receptors on Th1 cells involved in the cellular immune response to microbial agents include CXCR3, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, while Th2 cells express CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5. An additional class of T cells termed semi-nave cells may be induced by TGF-beta to express yet another class of chemokine receptors, CCR4 and CCR7. Although the expression of chemokine receptors in different cells is preferred in these cases, it is not absolute or exclusive, and there is overlap in expression between Th1 and Th2 cells. Although CCR7 positive cells have been reported to lack effector action, not be polarized, and to home only to lymphoid tissues, other studies have found CCR7 positive Th1 and Th2 cells and have identified CCR7 positive cells in non-lymphoid tissues. CCR4 appears associated with homing of lymphocytes to the skin, and CCR",
  "Activation of the MAPK kinase pathway has been identified as a mechanism that integrins use to regulate gene expression leading to cell shape changes during cell spreading or migration Epithelial cells respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cause integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates the surrounding proteins (paxillin, Fyn / shc, and src) and leads to signal amplification. FAK also binds PI-3 kinase and is upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. When MAPkinase or PI-3 kinase was inhibited, actin reorganization was blocked. Src phosphorylates p190RhoGAP, inactivating its GAP function that may allow RhoGTP to stay active longer, promoting further signal amplification. Activated RhoGTP binds to downstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (p160ROCK) and p140 diaphanous (p140Dia) to increase actin polymerization and contraction. Actin reorganization assists integrin clustering, allowing more ECM binding that increase FAK phosphorylation and other signal transduction events.",
  "One of responses to increased blood pressure is cardiac hypertrophy through increased size of ventricular myocardial cells leading to increased thickness of the ventricular walls. Cardiac hypertrophy allows the heart to handle the increased stress caused by elevated blood pressure but is also a risk factor associated with heart disease. Cardiac hypertrophy results from cross-talk between G-protein coupled receptor signaling and the EGF receptor pathway. Several GPCR ligands are known to stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, including factors that regulate blood pressure such as angiotensin II and endothelin- 1. These factors stimulate phospholipase C through Gq activation, and the production of 1P3 and diacylglycerol second messengers. PKC-delta is activated by DAG and interacts with the metalloproteinase ADAM12. ADAM12 cleaves the membrane-bound HB-EGF to release soluble EGF ligand that activates EGF receptor in myocardial cells. EGF receptor activation downstream through small G proteins and the MAP kinase pathway ultimately leads to cardiac hypertrophy. Signals by GPCR ligands such as angiotensin II result in transcriptional translation of immediate early genes like fos and other genes involved in long-term remodeling of heart tissue and the physiological response to stress in the heart such as the atrial natriuretic",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is one of a family of neurotrophins that induce the survival and proliferation of neurons. In cell culture NGF induces the formation of neurite projections and in vivo may stimulate the innervation of tissues. NGF plays a role in the repair, regeneration, and protection of neurons, and as such could serve as a therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. One potential method of NGF application would be through gene therapy or through implantation of cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo. NGF has also been suggested to play a role in other physiological systems and tissues such as the immune system. NGF has two receptors, TrkA and the p75 (NTR). NGF may signal its neuroprotective actions through the tyrosine kinase TrkA receptor and trigger apoptosis in some cells through the p75 receptor. High-affinity binding of NGF requires both TrkA and p75 (NTR). Binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor causes activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream signaling cascades. One of the downstream signaling pathways of NGF activates phospholipase C, releasing DAG and IP3 and activating associated downstream pathways such as protein kinase",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged / Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc) -co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.",
  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVD / C. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt / beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger",

  "Four different members of the Sprouty protein family block the cellular proliferation and differentiation induced by several different growth factors, including EGF and FGF. One mechanism by which Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling is through binding to Grb-2, a signaling intermediary between the tyrosine kinase growth factors and the Ras / map kinase pathway. Binding of Sprouty to Grb-2 prevents Grb-2 and Sos-1 from interacting with downstream signaling factors that activate Ras and map kinases, including Ras, Raf-1, Mek1, Erk1 / 2 and downstream transcription factors. The action of Sprouty as an inhibitor of this pathway requires Sprouty phosphorylation and membrane localization, at the site of the factors it interacts with. The inhibition of growth factor signaling by Sprouty is specific to the Ras pathway since the PI3 Kinase pathway responsible for cell survival signals from growth factor receptors is not inhibited by Sprouty. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is also not affected. The mechanism by which Sprouty inhibits Ras activation may be by blocking the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. Sprouty",
  "Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cell surface receptors like FAS, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death domain like FAS. The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets. Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis have been suggested.",
  "The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family transduces extracellular signals across the plasma membrane, activating cellular responses through a variety of second messenger cascades. These receptors provide rapid responses to a variety of stimuli, and are often rapidly attenuated in their signaling. Failure to attenuate GPCR signaling can have dramatic consequences. One method to attenuate GPCR signaling is by removal of the stimulus from the extracellular fluid. At the synapse, removal of neurotransmitter or peptide signaling molecules is accomplished by either reuptake or degradation. Acetylcholine is removed from synapses through degradation by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase results in prolonged signaling at the neuromuscular junction, and uncontrollable spasms in humans caused by nerve gas or in insects by some insecticides. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is also used therapeutically to treat Alzheimer's disease, compensating for the loss of cholinergic neurons. Transporters for serotonin, dopamine, GABA and noradrenaline remove these neurotransmitters from the synapse to terminate signaling. Antidepressants such as Prozac inhibit reuptake of serotonin and many drugs of abuse such as cocaine act by blocking reuptake of dopamine or adrenaline. Reuptake not only terminates signaling, but can also conserve neurotransmitter through recycling",
  "The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in macrophages are activated by their peptide ligands and also by the HIV envelope protein GP120 during HIV infection. One mechanism of signaling by these GPCRs is through activation of Gi signaling. These chemokine receptors can also signal through a Gi-independent pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. This pathway elevates calcium influx into the cell through CRAC channels, ion channels that are activated by calcium release. Elevated calcium from CRAC is required for downstream activation of Pyk2, a focal adhesion-associated protein kinase. Non Gi signaling by these chemokine receptors also involves the Jnk and p38 Map kinase pathways leading to AP-1 activation and activation of genes such as MIP-1 and MCP-1. This pathway may be involved in the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of AIDS.",
  "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha (PKA-RIIa) is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP350 (also known as AKAP450 and CGNAP), MAP2 and Pericentrin. This diagram illustrates these three PKA-RII binding complexes. The cyclin B-p34 (cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate PKA-RIIa on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of PKA-RIIa at the on set of mitosis. It has been demonstrated that PKA-RIIa dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The focal point of this illustration is the AKAP350 complex. In addition to binding PKA-RIIa, AKAP350 binds PKN (Takahashi et al 1999) and the phosphatases PP1 and PPA2 (Takahashi et al 1999). PKN is a serine / threonine protein kinase, having a catalytic domain homologous to the PKC family in the C-terminal region and a unique",
  "The cellular activation of the caspase cascade resulting in cell death is triggered by chemical damage to DNA which stimulates a sequence resulting in the cleavage of Bid in a manner similar to the binding of so called death-receptors or directly initiates the permeability transition of the mitochondrial membrane. The permiability transition releases several factors including cytochrome c, AIF and other factors in to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase cascade. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death.",
  "Signaling by interferon-gamma stimulates anti-viral responses and tumor suppression through the heterodimeric interferon-gamma receptor. Signaling is initiated by binding of interferon-gamma to its receptor, activating the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate STAT transcription factors that activate interferon responsive genes. Molecular chaperones that modulate or alter protein folding interact with different components of the interferon signaling pathway. One chaperone that modulates interferon signaling is hTid-1, a member of the DnaJ family of chaperones and a cochaperone for the heat shock protein Hsp70, another molecular chaperone. hTid-1 was found in a two-hybrid screen to bind to JAK2 and also to interact with the interferon-gamma receptor. In addition, hTid-1 and JAK2 also interact with Hsp70. Overexpression of hTid-1 represses transcriptional activation by interferon-gamma and Hsp70 dissociates from these proteins when interferon is added to cells, suggesting that Hsp70 holds Jak2 in an inactive conformation prior to ligand activation, and is released in the presence of agonist to allow the activation of Jak-2 and downstream pathway",
  "Myocardial infarction damages heart tissue both during the initial ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion of tissues with oxygen. Corticosteroids can protect cardiac tissue from damage following a heart attack, but the mechanisms by which corticosteroids are cardioprotective have not been clear and negative side effects such as reduced wound healing may result from their use. Corticosteroids exert a variety of actions through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. GR acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, but some of the cardioprotective effects mediated by GR-bound corticosteroids are non-transcriptional in nature. Glucocorticoids are commonly used as anti-inflammatory drugs in a variety of conditions, and some of their effects in the heart result from inhibition of the inflammatory response of heart tissue to ischemia and reperfusion. NF-kB is a transcription factor involved in signaling by inflammatory factors such as TNF, and is repressed by glucocorticoids. Annexin-1 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein whose expression is induced by corticosteroids and inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into tissue, blocking reperfusion-induced inflammatory heart damage. A non-transcriptional cardioprotective effect of glucocorticoids is activation of",
  "RhoA is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell morphology via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. The majority of RhoA activations is due to disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell morphology. RhoA is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. The RhoGAP ARHGAP1 also acts as a GAP for Rac and CDC42. Active RhoA increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several different factors downstream of RhoA act on cytoskeletal structures to affect stability of these structures. Rock1 provides a direct link from RhoA to cell morphology through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Rock1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses this activity. According to Nimnual et al. Rho activity is reduced as a result of Rac-induced redox-dependent inhibition. Related Disease: Non-syndromic deafness appears to be",
  "The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle",
  "Heart formation is cued by a combination of positive and negative signals from surrounding tissues. Inhibitory signals that block heart formation in anterior paraxial mesoderm include Wnt family members expressed in dorsal neural tube and anti-BMPs expressed in the axial tissues (i.e., noggin in the notochord). Wnt signalling pathway, which is essential for setting up the entire body pattern during embryonic development involves glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3 is active and phosphorylates b-catenin resulting in its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits GSK3, thereby preventing phosphorylation of b-catenin, which is then able to move to the nucleus. There it associates with members of the LEF-1 / TCF family of transcription factors, which activate the transcription of genes like cyclin-D1, myc, and MMPs. The Wnt signaling pathway is blocked by a family of secreted proteins such as crescent and Dkk-1 sufficient for induction of heart formation in posterior mesoderm. BMP signaling can also be blocked by the BMP antagonists noggin and chordin, which are secreted from the notochord and cooperate",
  "Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) are composed of at least three types of transmembrane protein -occludin, claudin and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) - and a cytoplasmic 'plaque' consisting of many different proteins that form large complexes. The transmembrane proteins mediate cell adhesion and are thought to constitute the intramembrane and paracellular diffusion barriers. The cytoplasmic 'plaque' contains three major multi-protein complexes consisting largely of scaffolding proteins, the ZO protein complex, the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ complex and the PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex. The ZO protein complex appears to organize the transmembrane proteins and couple them to other cytoplasmic proteins and to actin microfilaments. Two evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, the CRB3 and PAR complexes are involved in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. Besides these three protein complexes which seem to be constitutively associated at TJs, a number of proteins with different functions has been identified at TJs. These include additional scaffolding proteins like MUPP1 and MAGI-1, adaptor proteins, transcription regulators and RNA processing factors, regulatory proteins like small GTPases and G-proteins, kinases",
  "The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of three sites (ser 112,136 and 155). Phosphorylation at these sites results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. While ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with the activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. BAD Ser 155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors.",
  "Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF / CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF / CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the Endo",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",
  "Progression through the cell cycle is accompanied by activation of the proto-oncogene c-Src, a protein tyrosine kinase. Overexpression of Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein substrates and cellular transformation. During interphase the Src protein folds back upon itself to stay in the inactive state, with a phophotyrosine residue in one domain at Tyrosine 529 bound by an SH2 domain in the same protein. Activation of c-Src involves protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTP-alpha, or RPTP-alpha), a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic phosphatase domain. A variety of evidence has indicated that PTP-alpha dephosphorylates c-Src at Tyr529, allowing Src to open up and become activated, and that this activation occurs in association with mitosis. To activate Src, PTP-alpha must first open up the folded Src through binding itself to the phosphorylated Src domain, a process blocked by binding of Grb-2 to PTP-alpha at phosphorylated Tyr789. PTP-alpha phosphorylated at Tyr789 also binds to the Src SH2 domain, causing the Src structure to open at Src Tyr52",

  "Type I diabetes mellitus is a disease that results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. Certain beta-cell proteins act as autoantigens after being processed by antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and presented in a complex with MHC-II molecules on the surface of the APC. Then immunogenic signals from APC activate CD4 + T cells, predominantly of the Th1 subset. Antigen-activated Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFNgamma. They activate macrophages and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, and these effector cells may kill islet beta-cells by one or both of two types of mechanisms: (1) direct interactions of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells with a beta-cell autoantigen-MHC-I complex on the beta-cell, and (2) non-specific inflammatory mediators, such as free radicals / oxidants and cytokines (IL-1, TNFalpha, TNFbeta, IFNgamma). Type I diabetes is a polygenic disease. One of the principle determining genetic factors in diabetes incidence is the inheritance of mutant MHC-II alleles. Another plausible candidate gene is the insulin gene.",
  "The eukaryotic cell contains compartments with distinct functions bounded by lipid bilayer membranes. The movement of membrane vesicles between these compartments allows proteins in the secretory pathway to move outward from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, trans Golgi network (TGN), secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane and to be secreted into the extracellular environment. The trafficking of membrane vesicles is also essential for endocytosis and the movement of material from the extracellular environment into the early endosome (EE), late endosome (LE) and lysosome. The movement of vesicles and their contents between these compartments and their secretion are essential for a host of cellular functions, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. The movement of membrane vesicles between all of these compartments is regulated by members of the Rab family of GTPases, part of the ras superfamily of genes, regulated through binding of GTP and hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. At least eleven yeast genes in this family have been identified as Ypts, yeast transport proteins, and over sixty mammalian Rab genes have been identified in this highly conserved gene family. The products of the Rab genes regulate specific steps in vesicle transport. Rab1",
  "The activation of T cells requires a co-stimulatory signal with T cell receptor activation, provided in many cases by activation of CD28 in resting T cells. 4-1BB (CD137) is a member of the TNF receptor gene family that provides another T cell co-stimulatory signal. 4-1BB is expressed by activated cytotoxic and helper T cells and its expression is induced by a variety of T cell stimuli, including activation of the T cell receptor or stimulation with mitogens. The ligand for 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is induced on activated antigen-presenting cells including macrophages, activating T cells expressing 4-1BB. Mice lacking 4-1BB survive and have an altered though functional immune response. T cells of mice lacking 4-1BB proliferate more rapidly than normal T cells, but have reduced cytokine secretion. The costimulatory signal provided by 4-1BB may act in combination with CD28 activation to prolong the T cell response, and may also act independently of CD28. Stimulation of T cells with the 4-1BB ligand may provide a therapeutic immune response in the treatment of cancer or",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells serving as the cell's main digestive compartment to which all sorts of macromolecules are delivered for degradation. They contain more than 40 hydrolases in an acidic environment (pH of about 5). After synthesis in the ER, lysosomal enzymes are decorated with mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network. They are packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to late endosomes. Substances for digestion are acquired by the lysosomes via a series of processes including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.",
  "Cytokines are soluble extracellular proteins or glycoproteins that are crucial intercellular regulators and mobilizers of cells engaged in innate as well as adaptive inflammatory host defenses, cell growth, differentiation, cell death, angiogenesis, and development and repair processes aimed at the restoration of homeostasis. Cytokines are released by various cells in the body, usually in response to an activating stimulus, and they induce responses through binding to specific receptors on the cell surface of target cells. Cytokines can be grouped by structure into different families and their receptors can likewise be grouped.",
  "One of responses to increased blood pressure is cardiac hypertrophy through increased size of ventricular myocardial cells leading to increased thickness of the ventricular walls. Cardiac hypertrophy allows the heart to handle the increased stress caused by elevated blood pressure but is also a risk factor associated with heart disease. Cardiac hypertrophy results from cross-talk between G-protein coupled receptor signaling and the EGF receptor pathway. Several GPCR ligands are known to stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, including factors that regulate blood pressure such as angiotensin II and endothelin- 1. These factors stimulate phospholipase C through Gq activation, and the production of 1P3 and diacylglycerol second messengers. PKC-delta is activated by DAG and interacts with the metalloproteinase ADAM12. ADAM12 cleaves the membrane-bound HB-EGF to release soluble EGF ligand that activates EGF receptor in myocardial cells. EGF receptor activation downstream through small G proteins and the MAP kinase pathway ultimately leads to cardiac hypertrophy. Signals by GPCR ligands such as angiotensin II result in transcriptional translation of immediate early genes like fos and other genes involved in long-term remodeling of heart tissue and the physiological response to stress in the heart such as the atrial natriuretic",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. The GnRHR is coupled to Gq / 11 proteins to activate phospholipase C which transmits its signal to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates the intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and IP3 stimulates release of intracellular calcium. In addition to the classical Gq / 11, coupling of Gs is occasionally observed in a cell-specific fashion. Signaling downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Active MAPKs translocate to the nucleus, resulting in activation of transcription factors and rapid induction of early genes.",
  "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage biological macromolecules and are detrimental to cellular health. Electrophilic compounds, xenobiotics and antioxidants are sources of reactive oxygen species, creating oxidative stress that can harm cells. Enzymes are involved in the Phase II detoxification of xenobiotics to reduce cellular stress include glutathione transferases, quinone reductase, epoxide hydrolase, heme oxygenase, UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Expression of these genes protects cells from oxidative damage and can prevent mutagenesis and cancer. Transcription of these enzymes is coordinately regulated through antioxidant response elements (AREs). Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) and Nrf1 are transcription factors that bind to AREs and activate these genes. Inactive Nrf2 is retained in the cytosol by association a complex with the cytoskeletal protein Keap1. Cytosolic Nrf2 is phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to protein kinase C activation and Map kinase pathways. In the nucleus, Nrf2 activate genes through AREs by interacting with transcription factors in the bZIP family, including CREB, ATF4 and fos or jun. Nrf2 activation of genes is opposed by small maf proteins, including MafG and MafK,",

  "One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",
  "Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) plays a critical role in cellular proliferation and development. The biologically active form is a dimer formed from the A and B chains. PDGF is active to a differing degree depending on which dimer is formed (AA, AB, or BB). The PDGF Receptor (PDGFR) is also a dimer and can form from the combination of the alpha and beta chains in any order (alpha-alpha, alpha-beta, beta-beta). The PDGFR dimer is only formed after ligand binding so the alpha / beta composition of the receptor can be influenced by the form of PDGF that is present. Upon binding of ligand the PDGFR is tyrosine phosphorylated and leads to the phosphorylation of several other cellular proteins.",
  "Activation of the MAPK kinase pathway has been identified as a mechanism that integrins use to regulate gene expression leading to cell shape changes during cell spreading or migration Epithelial cells respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cause integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates the surrounding proteins (paxillin, Fyn / shc, and src) and leads to signal amplification. FAK also binds PI-3 kinase and is upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. When MAPkinase or PI-3 kinase was inhibited, actin reorganization was blocked. Src phosphorylates p190RhoGAP, inactivating its GAP function that may allow RhoGTP to stay active longer, promoting further signal amplification. Activated RhoGTP binds to downstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (p160ROCK) and p140 diaphanous (p140Dia) to increase actin polymerization and contraction. Actin reorganization assists integrin clustering, allowing more ECM binding that increase FAK phosphorylation and other signal transduction events.",
  "Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2 / neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) show elevated expression of EGF receptors (e.g. HER2 / neu) and their ligands (e.g.TGF-alpha) consistent with the presence of this autocrine loop. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.",
  "Phagocytosis plays an essential role in host-defense mechanisms through the uptake and destruction of infectious pathogens. Specialized cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes take part in this process in higher organisms. After opsonization with antibodies (IgG), foreign extracellular materials are recognized by Fc gamma receptors. Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors initiates a variety of signals mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, which lead through the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and membrane remodeling to the formation of phagosomes. Nascent phagosomes undergo a process of maturation that involves fusion with lysosomes. The acquisition of lysosomal proteases and release of reactive oxygen species are crucial for digestion of engulfed materials in phagosomes.",
  "The intestine is the largest lymphoid tissue in the body. One striking feature of intestinal immunity is its ability to generate great amounts of noninflammatory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies that serve as the first line of defense against microorganisms. The basic map of IgA production includes induction of mucosal B cells in the Peyer's patches, circulation through the bloodstream and homing to intestinal mucosa of IgA-commited plasma cells, and local antibody production for export across the intestinal membranes. Multiple cytokines, including TGF- {beta}, IL-10, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6, are required to promote IgA class switching and terminal differentiation process of the B cells. Secreted IgA promotes immune exclusion by entrapping dietary antigens and microorganisms in the mucus and functions for neutralization of toxins and pathogenic microbes.",

  "The hepatocyte growth factor receptor, also called c-Met, is activated by HGF and stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes and other cell types. Mutated forms of the HGF receptor are associated with oncogenesis and metastasis, making the HGF receptor a potential therapeutic target for cancer drugs. Changes in cell motility, cell shape, adhesion, resistance to apoptosis, and anchorage independent growth all contribute to the role of c-Met in cancer. The HGF receptor is a heterodimer with tyrosine kinase activity and associates with a multiprotein complex involved in downstream signal transduction. The HGF receptor can associate with several different signaling systems, including src, Grb2 / SOS, PI3 kinase and Gab1. One of the major substrates of the activated HGF receptor tyrosine kinase is the adaptor protein Gab1. Gab1 interacts with Crk and CrkL, two proteins with SH2 and SH3 protein interaction domains that couple to signaling further downstream. The actions of HGF on paxillin, DOCK180 and Rap1 mediated through GAB1 and other members of this complex alter cell motility. Regulation of Rho, Rac1 and CDC42 pathways in response to HGF all contribute to changes in cellular motility. Another target of",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The extrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to vascular walls or extravascular tissues. The damaged tissue releases tissue thromboplastin also known as tissue factor (TF). The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes as little as 15 seconds. This cascade is initiated by the activation of factor X by TF and factor VII. Activated factor X combined with factor V, factor VII and TF constitutes the prothrombin activator. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for each of these steps. The prothrombin activator in the extrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the intrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also the step leading to the activation of factor X. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin. Protein",
  "IL-22 is an inflammatory cytokine related to IL-10 that is produced by T cells and that induces a response in cells through a heterodimeric cell surface receptor composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2C. One of the actions of IL-22 appears to be the induction of the acute phase inflammatory response in hetapocytes, acting through activation of STATs and transcriptional regulation. A gene with homology to the extracellular domain of the cell surface IL-22R1 receptor component was identified that lacked transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The protein derived from this gene was found to bind IL-22 and block its interaction with the cell surface receptor. The IL-22 soluble receptor (IL-22BP, IL-22 binding protein) also blocks some of the downstream effects of IL-22 such as STAT activation and the transcriptional induction of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. The IL-22 soluble receptor may act as an anti-inflammatory agent.",

  "Axon guidance represents a key stage in the formation of neuronal network. Axons are guided by a variety of guidance factors, such as netrins, ephrins, Slits, and semaphorins. These guidance cues are read by growth cone receptors, and signal transduction pathways downstream of these receptors converge onto the Rho GTPases to elicit changes in cytoskeletal organization that determine which way the growth cone will turn.",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "Cutaneous melanin pigment plays a critical role in camouflage, mimicry, social communication, and protection against harmful effects of solar radiation. Melanogenesis is under complex regulatory control by multiple agents. The most important positive regulator of melanogenesis is the MC1 receptor with its ligands melanocortic peptides. MC1R activates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response-element binding protein (CREB). Increased expression of MITF and its activation by phosphorylation (P) stimulate the transcription of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), which produce melanin. Melanin synthesis takes place within specialized intracellular organelles named melanosomes. Melanin-containing melanosomes then move from the perinuclear region to the dendrite tips and are transferred to keratinocytes by a still not well-characterized mechanism.",
  "Glycolysis is the process of converting glucose into pyruvate and generating small amounts of ATP (energy) and NADH (reducing power). It is a central pathway that produces important precursor metabolites: six-carbon compounds of glucose-6P and fructose-6P and three-carbon compounds of glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate. Acetyl-CoA, another important precursor metabolite, is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. When the enzyme genes of this pathway are examined in completely sequenced genomes, the reaction steps of three-carbon compounds from glycerone-P to pyruvate form a conserved core module, which is found in almost all organisms and which often corresponds to operon structures in bacterial genomes. Gluconeogenesis is a synthesis pathway of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors. It is essentially a reversal of glycolysis with minor variations of alternative paths.",
  "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in 11 genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2 + sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2 + concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM",
  "The Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway involving eight enzymes essential for energy production through aerobic respiration, and, like glycolysis, arose early in evolution. This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl",
  "CTCF is central to signaling pathways in immature B cells elicited by cross-linking the Ig BCR and stimulation with TGF. Both stimuli result in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. BCR ligation stimulates a transient induction of MYC that leads to high level CTCF expression and feedback suppression of MYC transcription. BCR ligation also activates PTEN opposing PI3K activation of MYC. Pharmacologic inactivation of PI3K or mTOR / FRAP results in suppression of S6K resulting in activation of CTCF and suppression of MYC. CTCF activation induces transcriptional activation of p19ARF, with its downstream consequences, and of p27. Growth arrest is occasioned by co-expression of p21 and p27 and inhibition of MYC. CTCF, is bona fide multivalent DNA-sequence binder which specificity is mediated by different sets of zinc fingers (ZFs). For three different DNA target sites, particular groups of ZFs which cannot be deleted from the 11 ZF domain without loosing binding to a given site, are shown by a rainbow in the box on the left.",
  "Stathmin is a ubiquitous, cytosolic 19-kDa protein, which is phosphorylated on up to four sites in response to many regulatory signals within cells. Its molecular characterization indicates a functional organization including an N-terminal regulatory domain that bears the phosphorylation sites, linked to a putative alpha-helical binding domain predicted to participate in coiled-coil, protein-protein interactions. In addtion to the protein kinases that phospjhorylate Stathmin such as CaMK, MAPK, p34cdc2, PKA, a few other proteins have been suggested to interact with stathmin in vivo. One of them was identified as BiP, a member of the hsp70 heat-shock protein family. Another is a previously unidentified, putative serine / threonine kinase, KIS, which might be regulated by stathmin or, more likely, be part of the kinases controlling its phosphorylation state. Finally, two proteins, CC1 and CC2, predicted to form alpha-helices participating in coiled-coil interacting structures. It has been also suggest that the action of antimicrotubule drugs can be affected by stathmin in at least two ways: (a",
  "The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway is one of a handful of pleiotropic cascades used to transduce a multitude of signals for development and homeostasis in animals, from humans to flies. In mammals, the JAK / STAT pathway is the principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, STATs are activated by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. In addition to the activation of STATs, JAKs mediate the recruitment of other molecules such as the MAP kinases, PI3 kinase etc. These molecules process downstream signals via the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways which results in the activation of additional transcription factors.",
  "CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor in the GPCR gene family, and is expressed by cells in the immune system and the central nervous system. In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role",
  "Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2 / neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) show elevated expression of EGF receptors (e.g. HER2 / neu) and their ligands (e.g.TGF-alpha) consistent with the presence of this autocrine loop. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.",
  "A demonstrated means to increase lifespan in a wide range of organisms is through the restriction of caloric intake. Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric",
  "Four different members of the Sprouty protein family block the cellular proliferation and differentiation induced by several different growth factors, including EGF and FGF. One mechanism by which Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling is through binding to Grb-2, a signaling intermediary between the tyrosine kinase growth factors and the Ras / map kinase pathway. Binding of Sprouty to Grb-2 prevents Grb-2 and Sos-1 from interacting with downstream signaling factors that activate Ras and map kinases, including Ras, Raf-1, Mek1, Erk1 / 2 and downstream transcription factors. The action of Sprouty as an inhibitor of this pathway requires Sprouty phosphorylation and membrane localization, at the site of the factors it interacts with. The inhibition of growth factor signaling by Sprouty is specific to the Ras pathway since the PI3 Kinase pathway responsible for cell survival signals from growth factor receptors is not inhibited by Sprouty. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is also not affected. The mechanism by which Sprouty inhibits Ras activation may be by blocking the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. Sprouty",
  "This group of genes does not group into a meaningful cluster.",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is most commonly known as the cytokine secreted by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production and is used as a drug for the treatment of anemias. Epo is also secreted in the brain in response to hypoxia, such as ischemic stroke. Epo production in the brain is stimulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Administration of Epo to the brain in rodents before hypoxic stress or other neuronal stresses is neuroprotective, preventing neuronal apoptosis. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is known to associate with JAK kinases that phosphorylate and activate the STAT family of transcription factors. The neuroprotection by Epo involves cross-talk between Epo receptor and anti-apoptotic pathways through activation of NF-kB by the JAK2 kinase. Epo stimulates JAK2 phosphorylation of I-kB, releasing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of neuroprotective genes. Neuroprotective genes activated by NF-kB include the anti-oxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase and calbindin-D (28k). The erythropoietin receptor is also essential for proper brain development in mice. The absence of EpoR causes high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the developing",
  "The Fc Epsilon Receptor 1 signaling pathway in mast cells uses multiple core signal path to achieve its necessary ends. Through the BTK protein and PKC Mast cells are able to degranulate, through the PKC and MAPK paths the cells are able to alter cytokine expression and arachidonic acid release.",
  "The citrate cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle) is an important aerobic pathway for the final steps of the oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids. The cycle starts with acetyl-CoA, the activated form of acetate, derived from glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation for carbohydrates and from beta oxidation of fatty acids. The two-carbon acetyl group in acetyl-CoA is transferred to the four-carbon compound of oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon compound of citrate. In a series of reactions two carbons in citrate are oxidized to CO2 and the reaction pathway supplies NADH for use in the oxidative phosphorylation and other metabolic processes. The pathway also supplies important precursor metabolites including 2-oxoglutarate. At the end of the cycle the remaining four-carbon part is transformed back to oxaloacetate. According to the genome sequence data, many organisms seem to lack genes for the full cycle, but contain genes for specific segments.",
  "Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a biphasic disease, initiated by expression of the BCR / ABL fusion gene product in self-renewing, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs can differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), which then differentiate into granulocyte / macrophage progenitors (GMPs). HSCs can also differentiate into common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which are the progenitors of lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells. The initial chronic phase of CML (CML-CP) is characterized by a massive expansion of the granulocytic-cell series. Acquisition of additional genetic mutations beyond expression of BCR / ABL causes the progression of CML from chronic phase to blast phase (CML-BP), characterized by an accumulation of myeloid or lymphoid blast cells. The BCR / ABL fusion gene encodes p210BCR / ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The tyrosine kinase activity is essential for cell transformation and the cytoplasmic localization of BCR / ABL allows the assembly of phosphorylated substrates in multiprotein complexes that transmit",
  "Mammalian cell motility requires actin polymerization in the direction of movement to change membrane shape and extend cytoplasm into lamellipodia. The polymerization of actin to drive cell movement also involves branching of actin filaments into a network oriented with the growing ends of the fibers near the cell membrane. Manipulation of this process helps bacteria like Salmonella gain entry into cells they infect. Two of the proteins involved in the formation of Y branches and in cell motility are Arp2 and Arp3, both members of a large multiprotein complex containing several other polypeptides as well. The Arp2 / 3 complex is localized at the Y branch junction and induces actin polymerization. Activity of this complex is regulated by multiple different cell surface receptor signaling systems, activating WASP, and Arp2 / 3 in turn to cause changes in cell shape and cell motility. Wasp and its cousin Wave-1 interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex through the p21 component of the complex. The crystal structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex has revealed further insights into the nature of how the complex works. Activation by Wave-1, another member of the WASP family, also induces actin alterations in response to Rac1",
  "The protein export is the active transport of proteins from the cytoplasm to the exterior of the cell, or to the periplasmic compartment in Gram-negative bacteria. The sec dependent pathway is the general protein export system that transports newly synthesized proteins into or across the cell membrane. The translocation channel is formed from a conserved trimeric membrane protein complex, called the Sec61 / SecY complex. The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is another protein transport system that transports folded proteins in bacteria, archaea, and chloroplasts. Many Tat systems comprise three functionally different membrane proteins, TatA, TatB, and TatC, but TatA and TatE seem to have overlapping functions, with TatA having by far the more important role.",
  "The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer",
  "Cell cycle checkpoint controls at the G1 to S transition and the G2 to M transition prevent the cell cycle from progressing when DNA is damaged. The ATM protein kinase detects DNA damage and in response to this activates DNA repair factors and inhibits cell cycle progression. Two of the proteins that ATM phosphorylates in response to DNA damage are the tumor suppressor p53 and the checkpoint kinase chk1. In turn, the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with p21 to block the activity of cdk2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2) preventing passage from G1 to S phase and harmful replication of damaged DNA. One of the targets of cdk2 is the Rb gene product, another tumor suppressor. When dephosphorylated, Rb interacts with E2F transcription factors and prevents transcription of genes required for progression through the cell cycle. When phosphorylated by cell cycle dependent kinases like cdk2 and cdk4, Rb no longer interacts with E2F and the cell cycle proceeds through the G1-S checkpoint. DNA damage also regulates the G2-M phase transition by acting on the cell cycle regulator cdc2.",
  "Progression through the cell cycle is accompanied by activation of the proto-oncogene c-Src, a protein tyrosine kinase. Overexpression of Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein substrates and cellular transformation. During interphase the Src protein folds back upon itself to stay in the inactive state, with a phophotyrosine residue in one domain at Tyrosine 529 bound by an SH2 domain in the same protein. Activation of c-Src involves protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTP-alpha, or RPTP-alpha), a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic phosphatase domain. A variety of evidence has indicated that PTP-alpha dephosphorylates c-Src at Tyr529, allowing Src to open up and become activated, and that this activation occurs in association with mitosis. To activate Src, PTP-alpha must first open up the folded Src through binding itself to the phosphorylated Src domain, a process blocked by binding of Grb-2 to PTP-alpha at phosphorylated Tyr789. PTP-alpha phosphorylated at Tyr789 also binds to the Src SH2 domain, causing the Src structure to open at Src Tyr52",
  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",
  "IGF-1R, the type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor, mediates cell survival and growth in response to its ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. This tyrosine kinase receptor is widely expressed in many cell types and is a key mediator of growth. Overexpression or activation of IGF-1R may be involved in the proliferation of transformed cells, making inhibition of IGF-1R signaling a strategy for the development of cancer drugs. IGF-1R activates three signaling pathways that converge to phosphorylate BAD protein and block apoptosis. The first pathway activated by IGF-1R stimulates PI3-kinase and the AKT pathway to phosphorylate BAD and block apoptosis. A second pathway activated by IGF-1R involves ras mediated activation of the map kinase pathway to block apoptosis. A third pathway involves interaction of raf with mitochondria in response to IGF-1R activation. The convergence of these pathways to block apoptosis may enhance the IGF-1R response.",
  "Macrophages and NK cells help provide innate immunity against infection by intracellular parasites and communicate with each other to regulate this process. When stimulated, macrophages secrete the cytokine IL-12 that is essential for activation of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. IL-12 stimulates this NK cell response through activation of a JAK / STAT signaling pathway. Binding of IL-12 to its receptor on NK cells causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and another JAK kinase, Tyk2. Tyk2 in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT4, which can then translocate to the nucleus to activate genes, including the expression of interferon-gamma. IFN-gamma and IL-12 induce the differentiation of TH1 helper T cells that activate macrophages through interferon-gamma. A key modulator of NK cell activation by IL-12 is nitric oxide, NO, produced from arginine by the inducible nitric oxide synthase NOS2. Inactivation of the NOS2 gene in mice impairs the initial innate response to infection, including the activation of NK cells. This phenotype is similar to that of mice lacking interferon-gamma or IL-12 and a",
  "IL-5 is an inflammatory signaling molecule that primarily stimulates eosinophil proliferation, maturation and activation. Eosinophils are leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses that defend against parasites and cause some aspects of asthma, allergic reactions, and perhaps autoimmune disorders. The action of IL-5 begins with an immune response in tissues, such as activation of macrophages and T cells that secrete IL-1, IL-4 and IL-6. The immune response can lead to IL-5 secretion by T cells, eosinophils and mast cells. Secreted IL-5 stimulates production and maturation of eosinophils in bone marrow that migrate to tissues in response to eotaxin and release factors that damage tissues, causing some of the undesirable consequences of inflammation. The receptor for IL-5 is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit that is required for IL-5 selective binding and a beta subunit that is also part of the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors. Binding of IL-5 to the IL-5 receptor at the cell surface activates JAK / STAT signaling pathways that regulate transcription, proliferation, and differentiation.",
  "Five distinct stages have been proposed in the evolution of melanoma on the basis of histological criteria: common acquired and congenital nevi without dysplastic changes; dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia; radial-growth phase (RGP) melanoma; vertical-growth phase (VGP) melanoma; and metastatic melanoma. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Moreover, melanoma development is strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways. The vertical-growth phase and metastatic melanoma are notable for striking changes in the control of cell adhesion. Recently, amplification of the MITF gene was demonstrated in 10% of primary melanomas and 20% of metastatic melanomas, suggesting that MITF is a melanoma oncogene.",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",
  "Migration of cells is involved in essential functions such as development, invasiveness of cancer cells, leukocyte movement toward chemotactic signals, and fibroblast response to injury. Cells can migrate in a specific direction in response to extracellular signals through pathways that trigger changes in the cytoskeleton, particularly actin filaments, increasing lamellipodia and filopodia formation and decreasing focal adhesions. Factors like PDGF activate PI3 kinase and multiple pathways downstream to stimulate cell migration. One pathway regulating migration through the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase does not require PI3-kinase activity. In this pathway, p85 of PI3-kinase activates cdc42, which activates N-Wasp (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) to regulate ARP-2 / 3. ARP-2 / 3 is a complex of proteins localized at the leading edge of moving cells that nucleates the formation of new actin fibers and interacts with Wasp to stimulate migration. The cdc42 pathway also regulates p21-activate kinase 1 (PAK1). Another pathway by which PI3 kinase regulates migration is through the small GTPase Rac. PAK1 is a downstream target of Rac as well as",
  "The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Normally, ligand-dependent signaling by Hedgehog (Hh) homologs proceeds through binding to the Patched receptor. This binding relieves the Patched-mediated inhibition of signaling through the Smoothened (SMOH) gene product. This signaling ultimately results in the dissociation of the Gli1 transcription factor from an inhibitory complex in the cytoplasm, its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, and activation of target gene expression. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (> 50%) in sporadic BCC.",
  "Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), potentially lethal lesions. HR takes place in the late S-G2 phase of the cell cycle and involves the generation of a single-stranded region of DNA, followed by strand invasion, formation of a Holliday junction, DNA synthesis using the intact strand as a template, branch migration and resolution. It is investigated that RecA / Rad51 family proteins play a central role. The breast cancer susceptibility protein Brca2 and the RecQ helicase BLM (Bloom syndrome mutated) are tumor suppressors that maintain genome integrity, at least in part, through HR.",
  "The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of three sites (ser 112,136 and 155). Phosphorylation at these sites results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. While ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with the activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. BAD Ser 155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors.",
  "In the kidney, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) is a critical regulator of water homeostasis by controlling the water movement from lumen to the interstitium for water reabsorption and adjusting the urinary water excretion. In normal physiology, AVP is secreted into the circulation by the posterior pituitary gland, in response to an increase in serum osmolality or a decrease in effective circulating volume. When reaching the kidney, AVP binds to V2 receptors on the basolateral surface of the collecting duct epithelium, triggering a G-protein-linked signaling cascade, which leads to water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) vesicle insertion into the apical plasma membrane. This results in higher water permeability in the collecting duct and, driven by an osmotic gradient, pro-urinary water then passes the membrane through AQP2 and leaves the cell on the basolateral side via AQP3 and AQP4 water channels, which are constitutively expressed on the basolateral side of these cells. When isotonicity is restored, reduced blood AVP levels results in AQP2 internalization, leaving the apical membrane watertight again.",
  "This diagram is a compilation of Pyk2 effort cascades. In specific cell types the receptor and effoectors will vary. Binding of a transmembrane receptor triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1. In turn, Rac1 initiatates the JNK cascade, starting with PAK follwed by MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK. JNK activation causes induction of c-Jun gene binding. Pyk2 stimulation has also been shown to activate MKK3 leading to activation of p38. The other major mitogen activated kinase cascade for ERK1 / 2 is stimulated via RAS, RAF and MEKK1 / 2.",

  "Cytokines are soluble extracellular proteins or glycoproteins that are crucial intercellular regulators and mobilizers of cells engaged in innate as well as adaptive inflammatory host defenses, cell growth, differentiation, cell death, angiogenesis, and development and repair processes aimed at the restoration of homeostasis. Cytokines are released by various cells in the body, usually in response to an activating stimulus, and they induce responses through binding to specific receptors on the cell surface of target cells. Cytokines can be grouped by structure into different families and their receptors can likewise be grouped.",
  "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is associated with gamma secretase activity that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin-1 is also a component in gamma-secretase activity involved in signaling by the transmembrane protein Notch. Active gamma secretase requires PS-1 N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment and is unique in catalyzing proteolysis within the transmembrane region of proteins. Other proteins such as nicastrin may also be components of the gamma-secretase. Binding of the ligand Delta by Notch appears to trigger two proteolytic cleavages of Notch. The first step cleaves an extracellular domain and is catalyzed by a metalloprotease termed alpha-secretase or TACE. The second cleavage step appears to occur within the transmembrane domain of Notch, and releases a Notch intracellular doman (NICD). Once released, NICD moves into the nucleus where it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CSL family transcription factors (CBF1, Su (H), Lag-1) or other transcriptional regulators such as LEF-1. Presenilin is also involved in the Wnt / frizzled signaling pathway through beta-",
  "The complement system is part of the defense against invading cells and is composed of about twenty different proteins found in the plasma. When activated, complement proteins form a pathway of proteolytic reactions that culminates in the lysis of foreign cells. The complement system also stimulates phagocytosis of foreign cells and an inflammatory response. There are two different complement systems, the classical complement pathway initiated by antibody complexes on the cell surface, and an alternative complement pathway that is initiated without antibodies. The complement system proteins are named with a capital C followed by a number. A small letter after the number indicates that the protein is a smaller protein resulting from the cleavage of a larger precursor by a protease. In the classical pathway, the first step is the initiation of the pathway triggered by recognition by complement factor C1 of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface. When C1 complex interacts with aggregates of IgG with antigen on a cell's surface, two C1-associated proteases, C1r and C1s, are activated. Other factors like lipopolysaccharide also activate C1s. Once C1s is activated, it cleaves C4 to form C4b that then binds to the cell",
  "Many transcription factors play essential roles in normal development by determining the proliferation and differentiation of cells. The coordinated transcriptional control of proliferation in specific developmental cell types is crucial in multiple developmental settings. One of a family of three bicoid-related transcription factors, Pitx2 acts downstream of the extracellular signaling protein Wnt to drive proliferation of cells with specific developmental fates, including cells in the pituitary, cardiac outflow region, and muscle. Wnt binds to Frizzled, a G-protein coupled receptor, activating homologs of the Drosophila Disheveled protein. Activation of Frizzled and Disheveled inhibits the kinase GSK-3 beta, part of a protein complex in the absence of Wnt signaling, causing beta-catenin protein to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Beta-catenin is known to alter the function of transcription factors like TCF / Lef. One result of Wnt signaling is activation of the transcription factor Lef by beta-catenin, inducing Pitx2 expression. Wnt activation also changes Pitx2 from a repressor to an activator by causing transcriptional corepressors like histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) bound to Pitx2 to be exchanged for coactivators. With coactivators bound",
  "Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2 / TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP) / TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) / TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to",
  "HIV infection leads to drastic declines in CD4 T helper cells, in part through apoptosis of uninfected cells. Apoptosis of uninfected cells may be induced through the expression of Fas ligand on the surface of HIV-infected cells, stimulating the Fas-dependent apoptotic pathway in cells that come in contact with infected cells. The NEF protein expressed by HIV may play induce the expression of Fas-ligand by infected cells. If this is the case, then a question that arises is how infected cells themselves escape Fas-mediated apoptosis. The NEF protein appears to play a role in this process as well. NEF interacts with the ASK1 kinase (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase) involved in apoptotic signaling by TNF and Fas-ligand. Interaction of NEF with ASK1 prevents phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases and JNK kinases involved in apoptotic signaling.",
  "Attachment of the ubiquitin peptide to proteins targets them for proteolytic degradation by a complex cellular structure, the proteasome. The regulated proteolysis of proteins by proteasomes removes denatured, damaged or improperly translated proteins from cells and regulates the level of proteins like cyclins or some transcription factors. E1 and E2 enzymes prepare ubiquitin chains that are then attached to proteins by the E3 enzyme. The sequence of ubiquitin and the basic structure and function of the proteasome are highly conserved. The core proteasome in man (20S proteasome) consists of four rings each with 14 subunits stacked on top of each other that are responsible for the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. The PA700 regulatory complex is stacked on the ends of the cylindrical core to form a 26S proteasome. Proteins that are tagged with ubiquitin are recognized and bound by the regulatory subunits, then unfolded in an ATP-dependent manner, and inserted into the core particle, where proteases degrade the protein, releasing small peptides and releasing the ubiquitin intact. The PA28 regulatory complex is alternative regulatory complex that appears to play a role in antigen processing for presentation of peptides to immune cells in the",
  "The vitamin D receptor, VDR is the mediator of all genomic actions of vitamin D3 and its analogs. It belongs to a family of ligand induced transcription factors, nuclear receptors (NRs). Vitamin D3 is the main regulator of calcium homeostasis and is critical in bone formation. It is also involved in controlling cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis, which makes synthetic vitamin D3 analogues interesting for therapy of such diseases as cancer and psoriasis. NRs are comprised of: an amino-terminal activation function domain AF-1; the DNA-binding domain; a hinge region; and a carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain containing a second activation function, AF-2. VDR acts primarily as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on vitamin D response elements (VDREs). It interacts with the transcription machinery and nuclear receptor coactivators or corepressors to regulate target gene activity. NRs coregulators can be divided into 3 major classes: 1) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that are involved in the location and association of nucleosomes with DNA; 2) Enzymes that catalyze modifications of histone tails to regulate histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions",
  "The most recognized mechanism by which peroxisome proliferators regulated gene expresssion is through a PPAR / RXR heterodimeric complex binding to a peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) (classical mechanism). However, there are the possibility of several variations on this theme: 1). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR that preexists as a DNA complex with associated corepressors proteins. The interaction with ligand causes release of the corepressor and association with a coactivator, resulting in the classical mechanism. 2). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR as a soluble member of the nucleus. The binding of ligand results in RXR heterodimerization, DNA binding and coactivator recruitment. 3). In this scenario, PPAR exists in the cytosol, perhaps complexed to heat shock protein 90 and / or other chaperones. Binding of peroxisome proliferator causes a conformational change and translocation into the nucleus. Scenarios 4 and 5 require regulation of gene expression via non-classical mechanisms: 4). PPAR is capable of interacting with, and forming DNA binding heterodimers with, several nuclear receptors including the thyroid hormone receptor. The binding site for this non-RXR heterodimer need",
  "TNFR2 is the receptor for the 171 amino acid 19 kD TNF (beta) (a.k.a. lymphotoxin). TNF (beta) is produced by activated lymphocytes and can be cytotoxic to many tumor and other cells. In neutrophils, endothelial cells and osteoclasts TNF (beta) can lead to activation while in many other cell types it can lead to increased expression of MHC and adhesion molecules.",
  "Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy, is the molecular basis for learning and memory. Tetanic stimulation of afferents in the CA1 region of the hippocampus induces glutamate release and activation of glutamate receptors in dendritic spines. A large increase in i resulting from influx through NMDA receptors leads to constitutive activation of CaM kinase II (CaM KII). Constitutively active CaM kinase II phosphorylates AMPA receptors, resulting in potentiation of the ionic conductance of AMPA receptors. Early-phase LTP (E-LTP) expression is due, in part, to this phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized that postsynaptic Ca2 + increases generated through NMDA receptors activate several signal transduction pathways including the Erk / MAP kinase and cAMP regulatory pathways. The convergence of these pathways at the level of the CREB / CRE transcriptional pathway may increase expression of a family of genes required for late-phase LTP (L-LTP).",
  "The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Normally, ligand-dependent signaling by Hedgehog (Hh) homologs proceeds through binding to the Patched receptor. This binding relieves the Patched-mediated inhibition of signaling through the Smoothened (SMOH) gene product. This signaling ultimately results in the dissociation of the Gli1 transcription factor from an inhibitory complex in the cytoplasm, its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, and activation of target gene expression. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (> 50%) in sporadic BCC.",
  "Thrombopoietin (TPO) binds to its receptor inducing aggregation and activation. TPO signals its growth regulating effects to the cell through several major pathways including MAPK (ERK and JNK), Protein Kinase C, and JAK / Stat.",
  "Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling pathways in mast cells are initiated by the interaction of antigen (Ag) with IgE bound to the extracellular domain of the alpha chain of Fc epsilon RI. The activation pathways are regulated both positively and negatively by the interactions of numerous signaling molecules. Mast cells that are thus activated release preformed granules which contain biogenic amines (especially histamines) and proteoglycans (especially heparin). The activation of phospholipase A2 causes the release of membrane lipids followed by development of lipid mediators such as leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) and prostaglandins (especially PDG2). There is also secretion of cytokines, the most important of which are TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5. These mediators and cytokines contribute to inflammatory responses.",
  "Many different peptides act as signaling molecules, including the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin, the protease enzyme thrombin, and the blood pressure regulating peptide angiotensin. While these three proteins are distinct in their sequence and physiology, and act through different cell surface receptors, they share in a common class of cell surface receptors called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other polypeptide ligands of GPCRs include vasopressin, oxytocin, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, GnRH, leutinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, orexins, urotensin II, endorphins, enkephalins, and many others. GPCRs are a broad and diverse gene family that respond not only to peptide ligands but also small molecule neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline), light, odorants, taste, lipids, nucleotides, and ions. The main signaling mechanism used by GPCRs is to interact with G-protein GTPase proteins coupled to downstream second messenger systems including intracellular calcium release and cAMP production. The intracellular signaling systems used by peptide GPCRs are similar to those used by all GPCRs, and are typically classified according to the G-protein they interact with and the second",
  "Stathmin is a ubiquitous, cytosolic 19-kDa protein, which is phosphorylated on up to four sites in response to many regulatory signals within cells. Its molecular characterization indicates a functional organization including an N-terminal regulatory domain that bears the phosphorylation sites, linked to a putative alpha-helical binding domain predicted to participate in coiled-coil, protein-protein interactions. In addtion to the protein kinases that phospjhorylate Stathmin such as CaMK, MAPK, p34cdc2, PKA, a few other proteins have been suggested to interact with stathmin in vivo. One of them was identified as BiP, a member of the hsp70 heat-shock protein family. Another is a previously unidentified, putative serine / threonine kinase, KIS, which might be regulated by stathmin or, more likely, be part of the kinases controlling its phosphorylation state. Finally, two proteins, CC1 and CC2, predicted to form alpha-helices participating in coiled-coil interacting structures. It has been also suggest that the action of antimicrotubule drugs can be affected by stathmin in at least two ways: (a",
  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin. There are 4 major histologic subtypes of RCC: conventional (clear cell RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Multiple genes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for hereditary (von Hippel-Lindau) and sporadic variants of conventional (clear cell) RCC. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. An oncogene, MET has been found to be mutant in cases of hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), although the incidence of c-MET mutations is low in sporadic papillary RCC. Once activated, MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome (HLRCC",
  "Over 1,000 papers and reviews have been written about the role of ceramide in the production of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Ceramide is a sphingosine-based lipid-signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This diagram represents some of the current understanding of the cascades that couple ceramide to specific signaling pathways. These cascades illustrate that ceramide can be a growth stimulus or proapototic signal. The ultimate ceramide action is determined within the context of other stimuli and by the subcellular topology of its production and is cell-type specific. There are 2 forms of sphingomyelinase, acid (acid-sphingomyelinase: A-SMase) and neutral (neutral-sphingomyelinase N-SMase), that can produce ceramide. TNF-alpha can stimulate either form of sphingomyelinase as can other death receptors. Different domanis of TNF-alpha stimulate the different Smases. N-SMase stimulation is enhanced by the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1). The activity of each form is dependent on the local intracellular pH. In the illustration the forms are seperated to reduce confusion however",
  "Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite of macrophages that causes visceral, mucosal, and cutaneous diseases. The parasite is transmitted to humans by sandflies, where they survive and proliferate intracellularly by deactivating the macrophage. Successful infection of Leishmania is achieved by alteration of signaling events in the host cell, leading to enhanced production of the autoinhibitory molecules like TGF-beta and decreased induction of cytokines such as IL12 for protective immunity. Nitric oxide production is also inhibited. In addition, defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes silences subsequent T cell activation mediated by macrophages, resulting in abnormal immune responses.",
  "Phagocytosis plays an essential role in host-defense mechanisms through the uptake and destruction of infectious pathogens. Specialized cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes take part in this process in higher organisms. After opsonization with antibodies (IgG), foreign extracellular materials are recognized by Fc gamma receptors. Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors initiates a variety of signals mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, which lead through the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and membrane remodeling to the formation of phagosomes. Nascent phagosomes undergo a process of maturation that involves fusion with lysosomes. The acquisition of lysosomal proteases and release of reactive oxygen species are crucial for digestion of engulfed materials in phagosomes.",
  "Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.",
  "Mammalian cell motility requires actin polymerization in the direction of movement to change membrane shape and extend cytoplasm into lamellipodia. The polymerization of actin to drive cell movement also involves branching of actin filaments into a network oriented with the growing ends of the fibers near the cell membrane. Manipulation of this process helps bacteria like Salmonella gain entry into cells they infect. Two of the proteins involved in the formation of Y branches and in cell motility are Arp2 and Arp3, both members of a large multiprotein complex containing several other polypeptides as well. The Arp2 / 3 complex is localized at the Y branch junction and induces actin polymerization. Activity of this complex is regulated by multiple different cell surface receptor signaling systems, activating WASP, and Arp2 / 3 in turn to cause changes in cell shape and cell motility. Wasp and its cousin Wave-1 interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex through the p21 component of the complex. The crystal structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex has revealed further insights into the nature of how the complex works. Activation by Wave-1, another member of the WASP family, also induces actin alterations in response to Rac1",
  "Growth hormone plays a major role in regulating growth during childhood and adolescence and also regulates metabolism. Defects in growth hormone signaling can result in dwarfism and decreases in growth hormone levels with age have been suggested to play a role in the reduced function of some physiological systems. Growth hormone signals a response in cells through the growth hormone receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Growth hormone causes the receptor to dimerize, activating the JAK2 protein kinase. The activity of JAK2 mediates many of the downstream responses to growth hormone through phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, MAP kinases, other kinase cascades and molecules involved in metabolism like IRS-1. Factors like SOCS and SHP-1 appear to play a role in the down regulation of signaling by growth hormone and cytokines.",
  "The molecular events that lead to the perception of pain are a key research field in medicine and drug discovery. The opioid receptors modulate pain signaling in response to endogenous peptide ligands and opiate drugs such as morphine. The kappa opioid receptor plays a key role in the profound analgesia of opiates and is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand dynorphin, encoded by the prodynorphin gene. Production of prodynorphin is transcriptionally regulated by a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the prodynorphin gene. A transcription factor called DREAM (DRE antagonistic modulator) binds to the DRE and represses prodynorphin transcription when bound. DREAM binds calcium with 4 EF-hand motifs and the binding of DREAM to DNA is repressed in the presence of calcium. Many transcription factors are regulated by calcium indirectly through calcium sensitive kinases and phosphatases, but DREAM is unique to date in being a transcription factor that directly binds calcium and is regulated by calcium binding. DREAM may also regulate other genes such as c-fos. DREAM is expressed in spinal cord neurons in regions involved in pain signaling. The regulation of prodynorphin expression by DREAM also leads to the hypothesis that DREAM is involved in pain signaling",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged / Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc) -co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.",
  "This diagram is a compilation of Pyk2 effort cascades. In specific cell types the receptor and effoectors will vary. Binding of a transmembrane receptor triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1. In turn, Rac1 initiatates the JNK cascade, starting with PAK follwed by MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK. JNK activation causes induction of c-Jun gene binding. Pyk2 stimulation has also been shown to activate MKK3 leading to activation of p38. The other major mitogen activated kinase cascade for ERK1 / 2 is stimulated via RAS, RAF and MEKK1 / 2.",
  "The scanning translation initiation model suggests that 40S ribosomal subunit preloaded with factors bind to the 5 end of the mRNA near the cap. The 48S subunit moves along the mRNA until it finds the initiation triplet and in complex with tRNA and 60S subunit formed the first peptide bond. Translation control is mostly regulated at the protein initiation step through translation initiation factors such as eIF2 or eIF4.",
  "Ca2 + that enters the cell from the outside is a principal source of signal Ca2 +. Entry of Ca2 + is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2 + by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2 + fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2 + -entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs). The other principal source of Ca2 + for signalling is the internal stores that are located primarily in the endoplasmic / sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER / SR), in which inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RYRs) regulate the release of Ca2 +. The principal activator of these channels is Ca2 + itself and this process",
  "Ang II binding to AT1-R triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to the Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1 but not Cdc42, although the direct activation of Rac1 by Pyk2 is not proved in this study. In turn, Rac1 activates a small G protein-activated kinase whose identity is still controversial, but one of which has been suggested to be PAK1. Finally, the JNK cascade, including MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK, is activated, causing induction of c-Jun gene via binding of ATF2 and c-Jun heterodimer to the junTRE2 site. Ang II is closely involved in the cardiac remodeling by stimulating synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It was recently found that expression of fibronectin by Ang II is transcriptionally regulated by AP-1 complex in cardiac fibroblasts. Collagenase gene containg AP-1 sites is also regulated by AP-1 components including c-Jun. AP-1 activity is also enhanced in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Expression of ANF is regulated by AP-1 components.",
  "The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) couples binding of extracellular growth factor ligands to intracellular signaling pathways regulating diverse biologic responses, including proliferation, differentiation, cell motility, and survival. Ligand binding to the four closely related members of this RTK family -epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB-1 or HER1), ErbB-2 (HER2), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4) -induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues (pY) within the cytoplasmic tail. Signaling effectors containing binding pockets for pY-containing peptides are recruited to activated receptors and induce the various signaling pathways. The Shc- and / or Grb2-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a common target downstream of all ErbB receptors. Similarly, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway is directly or indirectly activated by most ErbBs. Several cytoplasmic docking proteins appear to be recruited by specific ErbB receptors and less exploited by others. These include the adaptors Crk",
  "Neutrophils respond to bacterial infection by releasing reactive oxygen species that kill bacteria and by expressing chemokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection. The multisubunit enzyme NADPH oxidase expressed by neutrophils produces reactive oxygen species rapidly released in what is known as the respiratory burst. Activity of the NADPH oxidase is induced by fMLP receptor ligands, formylated peptides from bacteria. The fMLP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, FPR-1, that activates Map kinase pathways and phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation releases IP3 and calcium, activating protein kinase C and also activating the transcription factor NFAT, which contributes to activation of chemokine genes. One of the components of the NADPH oxidase is p47phox. PKC activation phosphorylates p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase activity. Activation of Map kinase cascades leads to Erk1 / Erk2 dependent p47phox phosphorylation as well as activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and chemokine gene expression. Inhibition of p38 did not affect p47phox phosphorylation, indicating that p38 is not involved in Erk1 / 2 activation of the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of p38 did inhibit",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting foreign DNA from invading microbes or host cells and generating innate immune responses. DAI is the first identified sensor of cytosolic DNA which activates the IRF and NF- {kappa} B transcription factors, leading to production of type I interferon and other cytokines. The second type of cytoplasmic DNA sensor is AIM2. Upon sensing DNA, AIM2 triggers the assembly of the inflammasome, culminating in interleukin maturation. In addition to these receptors, there is a mechanism to sense foreign DNA, with the host RNA polymerase III converting the DNA into RNA for recognition by the RNA sensor RIG-I. These pathways provide various means to alert the cell.",
  "Significant progress has been made towards delineation of the intrinsic molecular processes that regulate B lymphocyte immune function. Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a broad range of cellular and physiological responses. In addition to playing a role in inflammation and hematopoiesis, IL-6 is involved in other processes such as neuronal differentiation and bone loss. To produce these effects IL-6 signals through a receptor composed of two different subunits, an alpha subunit that produces ligand specificity and gp130, a receptor subunit shared in common with other cytokines in the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT3, that move into the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing STAT3 response elements. The ras-mediated pathway, acting through Shc, Grb-2 and Sos-1 upstream and activating Map kinases downstream, activates transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-IL-6 (C / EBP-beta) that can act through their own cognate response elements in the genome. These factors and other transcription factors like AP-1 and SRF (",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.",
  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein identified genetically as an important developmental factor. Shh provides a morphogenic signal in the developing CNS, organizing the spatial patterning of cells in the midbrain and inducing proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum, neural tube and retina. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Sonic hedgehog signaling may proceed by more than one mechanism. One signaling pathway is activated by Shh binding to Patched (Ptc-1) which releases inhibition of the GPCR Smoothened, activating the Shh signaling pathway and allowing progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Shh can also affect progression through the G2 / M transition. Patched binds to phosphorylated Cyclin B1, one component of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), along with the kinase Cdc2. The interaction of Cyclin B1 with Patched blocks MPF activity, blocking progression through the G2 / M transition. Shh binding leads to degradation of Ptc-1, release of Cyclin B1, and entry of the cyclin B1 into the nucleus. Pat",

  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2 / cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2 / cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2 / cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S / G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical,",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",

TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) provide a potent proliferative signaling system that stimulates growth in many different cell types and blocks apoptosis. In vivo IGF-1 acts as an intermediate of many growth hormone responses, and may stimulate the growth of some types of cancer. IGF-1 also provides a mitogenic signal to act as a growth factor for many tissue culture cells. One component of IGF-1 mitogenic signaling is association of the receptor tyrosine kinase with Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1 to activate ras and the Map kinase cascade (raf, Mek, Erk). An endpoint of the Map kinase pathway is modification of transcription factor activity, such as activation of ELK transcription factors. Serum response factor (SRF) and AP-1 contribute to mitogenic signaling by many factors. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI3 kinase activation are also involved in IGF-1 signaling, similar to insulin signaling.",
  "Reliable neurotransmitter release requires the presence of sufficent numbers of synaptic vesicles. The process of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) is coordinated by a group of proteins called dephosphins. The current set of seven known dephosphins are nerve treminal proteins with little or no structural hoimology but satisfy two essential criteria: they are essential for SVE and they are rapidly and coordinately dephosphorlyated in response to a calcium influx through voltage-dependent calicium channels. The calicium signal is mediated by calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin. Each dephosphin plays an essential role in overlapping phases or segments of the cycle. The four phases of SVE are nucleation, invagination, fission and uncoating. In this diagram the internalization of the vesicle is the uncoating step. In order to illustrate the complexity of this process the initial display of the protein is labelled with a name and a number. This number is then used at the decloaking or uncoating step to show the release and seperation of the various factors. Each step in the process has a different set of complex components. The",
  "Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2 / TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP) / TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) / TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to",
  "One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin proteins form pores in the membranes of the attacked cell, allowing the entry of Granzyme A and Granzyme B. Granzyme B induces caspase activation and cleavage of factors like ICAD, releasing DFF40 to fragment DNA, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Granzyme A is also an abundant granzyme released by cytotoxic T cells and is important in cytotoxic T cell induced apoptosis, activating caspase independent pathways. Once in a cell, Granzyme A activates DNA nicking by the recently identified DNAse NM23-H1, a tumor suppressor gene product whose expression is reduced in transformed, metastatic cells. The previous identification of NM23-H1 as a tumor suppressor indicates that its DNAse activity plays an important role in immune surveillance to prevent cancer through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of NM23-H1 occurs indirectly, through the cleavage of proteins that inhibit NM23-H1 in the SET complex, which includes SET, Ape1, pp32 and",
  "BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified genetically as breast cancer susceptibility genes when a single copy of the gene is mutated and are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, including blocking cell cycle progression and inducing DNA repair to preserve the integrity of the genome during cell division. BRCA1 and BRCA2 induce double-stranded repair of breaks using homologous recombination, in part through activation of RAD51. BRCA1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase targeting the protein FancD2 that activates checkpoint control, integrating the ATM response to ionizing radiation and the FA response to cross-linking agents like mitomycin C. Mutation of one of the several components of the FA complex involved in maintaining integrity of the genome leads to the condition Fanconi anemia. One member of the FA complex was recently identified as BRCA2, which leads to Fanconi anemia when both copies of the gene are mutated. Another related factor involved in the response of cells to DNA damage is the kinase ATM. ATM is mutated in patients with AT, a condition with many similar traits to Fanconi anemia. Like ATM, ATR serves as a checkpoint kinase that halts cell cycle progression and induces DNA repair when DNA is damaged. Loss",
  "Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt / Ca2 + pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2 + signalling is mediated through",
  "About 2-5% of type II diabetic patients suffer from a monogenic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. This monogenic form of type II diabetes is called maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We now know that MODY is caused by heterozygous mutations in at least five genes encoding transcription factors: HNF4alpha (MODY1), HNF1alpha (MODY3), PDX1 (MODY4), HNF1beta (MODY5) and NEUROD1 (MODY6). MODY2, which is so far the only subtype not related to a transcription factor, is caused by mutations in the glucokinase gene. Mutations of MODY transcription factor genes lead to abnormal expression of genes involved in pancreatic islet development and metabolism.",
  "A complex network of interacting proteins and enzymes is required for DNA replication. Generally, DNA replication follows a multistep enzymatic pathway. At the DNA replication fork, a DNA helicase (DnaB or MCM complex) precedes the DNA synthetic machinery and unwinds the duplex parental DNA in cooperation with the SSB or RPA. On the leading strand, replication occurs continuously in a 5 to 3 direction, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA replication occurs discontinuously by synthesis and joining of short Okazaki fragments. In prokaryotes, the leading strand replication apparatus consists of a DNA polymerase (pol III core), a sliding clamp (beta), and a clamp loader (gamma delta complex). The DNA primase (DnaG) is needed to form RNA primers. Normally, during replication of the lagging-strand DNA template, an RNA primer is removed either by an RNase H or by the 5 to 3 exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments. In eukaryotes, three DNA polymerases (alpha, delta, and epsilon) have been identified. DNA primase forms a permanent complex with DNA polymerase alpha.",

  "E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2 / cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2 / cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2 / cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S / G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical,",
  "A demonstrated means to increase lifespan in a wide range of organisms is through the restriction of caloric intake. Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to infection by the immune system that requires communication between different classes of immune cells to coordinate their actions. Acute inflammation is an important part of the immune response, but chronic inappropriate inflammation can lead to destruction of tissues in autoimmune disorders and perhaps neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disease. Secreted cytokine proteins provide signals between immune cells to coordinate the inflammatory response. Some cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF act to broadly provoke the inflammatory response while others act on specific types of immune cells. Macrophages and other phagocytotic cells provide a front-line defense against bacterial infection. Macrophages stimulate the inflammatory responses of neutrophils, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in response infection by secreting IL-1 and TNF. IL-1 and TNF cause fever through alteration of the body temperature set-point in the hypothalamus. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to IL-1 and TNF by recruiting more immune cells to the site of inflammation. Secreted IL-8 is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils to sites of infection. Macrophages also present antigen to T helper cells that play a central role in coordinating immune responses. T helper cells induce clonal",
  "IGF-1R, the type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor, mediates cell survival and growth in response to its ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. This tyrosine kinase receptor is widely expressed in many cell types and is a key mediator of growth. Overexpression or activation of IGF-1R may be involved in the proliferation of transformed cells, making inhibition of IGF-1R signaling a strategy for the development of cancer drugs. IGF-1R activates three signaling pathways that converge to phosphorylate BAD protein and block apoptosis. The first pathway activated by IGF-1R stimulates PI3-kinase and the AKT pathway to phosphorylate BAD and block apoptosis. A second pathway activated by IGF-1R involves ras mediated activation of the map kinase pathway to block apoptosis. A third pathway involves interaction of raf with mitochondria in response to IGF-1R activation. The convergence of these pathways to block apoptosis may enhance the IGF-1R response.",
  "The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer",
  "Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage.",
  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin. There are 4 major histologic subtypes of RCC: conventional (clear cell RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Multiple genes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for hereditary (von Hippel-Lindau) and sporadic variants of conventional (clear cell) RCC. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. An oncogene, MET has been found to be mutant in cases of hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), although the incidence of c-MET mutations is low in sporadic papillary RCC. Once activated, MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome (HLRCC",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "Blood-cell development progresses from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), which can undergo either self-renewal or differentiation into a multilineage committed progenitor cell: a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) or a common myeloid progenitor (CMP). A CLP gives rise to the lymphoid lineage of white blood cells or leukocytes-the natural killer (NK) cells and the T and B lymphocytes. A CMP gives rise to the myeloid lineage, which comprises the rest of the leukocytes, the erythrocytes (red blood cells), and the megakaryocytes that produce platelets important in blood clotting. Cells undergoing these differentiation process express a stage- and lineage-specific set of surface markers. Therefore cellular stages are identified by the specific expression patterns of these genes.",
  "T helper cells play an essential role coordinating the activities of other parts of the immune system, including B cells, cytotoxic T cells, macrophages and other cells. The crucial nature of helper T cells in the normal immune response is demonstrated by the severe immune deficiency associated with the HIV-induced helper T cell depletion. To communicate with other cells, helper T cells express a range of cell surface molecules, a few of which are illustrated in this figure. Like all T cells, helper T cells express T cell receptors complexed with the CD3 proteins that are responsible for the recognition and response of the cell to specific antigens. CD4 is commonly used as a marker for helper T cells, in contrast to cytotoxic T cells, which express CD8. CD4 is used by HIV to gain cell entry, as well as the CCR5 chemokine receptor. Thy1 provides a more general cell surface antigen used to identify both T helper and cytotoxic T cells. CD28 provides a costimulatory signal in association with the activation of the T cell receptor complex by an antigen presenting cell that is required for the T cell to become activated.

  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. Generally, lymphocyte adhesion and passage from the bloodstream to the lymphatic system occurs in the high endothelial venules of the lymphnodes. This way the lymphocytes can communicate with each other in the lymphatic system and search for foreign compounds after their recirculation to the bloodstream, this fulfilling their role in the immune system. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flatteningof the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or",
  "Exposure to divalent cadmium ions (Cd2 +) is a known cancer risk factor, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inappropriate induction of cellular proliferation by cadmium are still being figured out. One cellular model used to study this process is macrophages grown in culture. In cultured macrophages, cadmium acts both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm to induce proliferation. At the cell surface, cadmium interacts with a pertussis-sensitive cell surface receptor, probably a Gi-coupled GPCR, to stimulate proliferation. Cadmium can enter cells through calcium ion channels and once in cells affects calcium release by the ER. In addition to changes in intracellular calcium, the proliferative effects of cadmium are mediated by the Ras / Map kinase pathway, and also NF-kB. Inhibition of phospholipase C, map kinases, or NF-kB with a variety of pharmacological inhibitors all blocked the activation of cellular proliferation by cadmium. Protein kinase C is also activated by cadmium, upstream of the Map kinase pathway. Changes in transcription induced by cadmium include induction of immediate early genes like fos, jun, and myc. In addition to inducing cellular proliferation, cadmium also is slightly genotoxic",

  "The glycolytic pathway begins with the simple sugar glucose and leads to pyruvate and eventually the Kreb's cycle. Dietary carbohydrates include a variety of sugars that are funneled into glycolysis to supply energy, including other monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides like starch. Fructose is an abundant monosaccharide in fruit, and is also found along with glucose in the common disaccharide sucrose. Fructose enters glycolysis by different pathways in the liver and muscle. In muscle, fructose is a substrate of hexokinase, like glucose, and enters the pathway directly as fructose 6-phosphate. In liver, hexokinase is present in very low levels and fructose passes through a more complex pathway. Fructose is first phosphorylated to form fructose 1-phosphate, which is then split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to enter glycolysis as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The sugar mannose also enters glycolysis at this point, first being converted to mannose 6-phosphate that is then isomerized to produce fructose 6-phosphate. Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk, and is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose only differs from glucose in its stereochemistry at one position, but",
  "For a T cell to be activated by a specific antigen, the T cell receptor must recognize complexes of MHCI with the antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. T cells and the T cell receptor complex do not respond to antigen in solution, but even for the specific antigen they only respond to antigen-MHC-1 complexes on the cell surface. This interaction is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. T cell activation also requires a co-stimulatory signal involving interaction of CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 family genes) on the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 activates a signal transduction pathway acting through PI-3K, Lck and Grb-2 / ITK to provide its co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation. Another means to control T cell activation is by expressing factors that down-regulate T cell activation. Signaling by activated T cell receptors induces expression of CTLA-4, a receptor that opposes T cell activation. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity than CD28 for B7 proteins, terminating T cell activation.",
  "Thrombin is an extracellular protease that is involved in the clotting of blood and inflammation through its action on platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature and that plays a role in thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4.

  "Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes.

  "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was first identified by virtue of the essential role it plays in collagen modification, preventing the nutritional deficiency scurvy. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for hydroxylase enzymes that post-translationally modify collagen to increase the strength and elasticity of tissues. Vitamin C reduces the metal ion prosthetic groups of many enzymes, maintaining activity of enzymes, also acts as an anti-oxidant. Although the prevention of scurvy through modification of collagen may be the most obvious role for vitamin C, it is not necessarily the only role of vitamin C. Svct1 and Svct2 are ascorbate transporters for vitamin C import into tissues and into cells. Both of these transporters specifically transport reduced L-ascorbic acid against a concentration gradient using the intracellular sodium gradient to drive ascorbate transport. Svct1 is expressed in epithelial cells in the intestine, upregulated in cellular models for intestinal epithelium and appears to be responsible for the import of dietary vitamin C from the intestinal lumen. The vitamin C imported from the intestine is present in plasma at approximately 50 uM, almost exclusively in the reduced form, and is transported to tissues to play",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM (familial DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of familial DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an idiopathic DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of idiopathic DCM focus on chronic viral myocarditis and / or on autoimmune abnormalities. Viral myocarditis may progress to an autoimmune phase and then to progressive cardiac dilatation. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with idiopathic DCM, may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2 +, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.",
  "IL-7 is a key cytokine in the immune system, essential for normal development of B cells and T cells. Mice with the IL-7 receptor deleted lack B and T cells. Some humans with SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency disease) also have mutation of their IL-7 receptor gene leading to an absence of T cells and greatly impaired B cell production. The IL-7 receptor includes two polypeptides, a gamma chain and an alpha chain. The alpha-chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor while several other cytokines use the same gamma receptor chain as IL-7, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. Binding of IL-7 to the alpha chain leads to dimerization of the alpha and gamma chains. JAK3 associated with the gamma chain tyrosine phosphorylates the alpha chain after dimerization. The importance of JAK3 in IL-7 signaling is supported by the similarity of the immune defects in JAK3 knockout mice and IL-7 knockout mice. The phosphorylated alpha chain serves as the site for recruiting other signaling molecules to the complex to be phosphorylated and activated",
  "p53 activation is induced by a number of stress signals, including DNA damage, oxidative stress and activated oncogenes. The p53 protein is employed as a transcriptional activator of p53-regulated genes. This results in three major outputs; cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence or apoptosis. Other p53-regulated gene functions communicate with adjacent cells, repair the damaged DNA or set up positive and negative feedback loops that enhance or attenuate the functions of the p53 protein and integrate these stress responses with other signal transduction pathways.",
  "Neutrophils respond to bacterial infection by releasing reactive oxygen species that kill bacteria and by expressing chemokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection. The multisubunit enzyme NADPH oxidase expressed by neutrophils produces reactive oxygen species rapidly released in what is known as the respiratory burst. Activity of the NADPH oxidase is induced by fMLP receptor ligands, formylated peptides from bacteria. The fMLP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, FPR-1, that activates Map kinase pathways and phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation releases IP3 and calcium, activating protein kinase C and also activating the transcription factor NFAT, which contributes to activation of chemokine genes. One of the components of the NADPH oxidase is p47phox. PKC activation phosphorylates p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase activity. Activation of Map kinase cascades leads to Erk1 / Erk2 dependent p47phox phosphorylation as well as activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and chemokine gene expression. Inhibition of p38 did not affect p47phox phosphorylation, indicating that p38 is not involved in Erk1 / 2 activation of the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of p38 did inhibit",
  "The eukaryotic cell contains compartments with distinct functions bounded by lipid bilayer membranes. The movement of membrane vesicles between these compartments allows proteins in the secretory pathway to move outward from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, trans Golgi network (TGN), secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane and to be secreted into the extracellular environment. The trafficking of membrane vesicles is also essential for endocytosis and the movement of material from the extracellular environment into the early endosome (EE), late endosome (LE) and lysosome. The movement of vesicles and their contents between these compartments and their secretion are essential for a host of cellular functions, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. The movement of membrane vesicles between all of these compartments is regulated by members of the Rab family of GTPases, part of the ras superfamily of genes, regulated through binding of GTP and hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. At least eleven yeast genes in this family have been identified as Ypts, yeast transport proteins, and over sixty mammalian Rab genes have been identified in this highly conserved gene family. The products of the Rab genes regulate specific steps in vesicle transport. Rab1",
  "Cytokines are soluble extracellular proteins or glycoproteins that are crucial intercellular regulators and mobilizers of cells engaged in innate as well as adaptive inflammatory host defenses, cell growth, differentiation, cell death, angiogenesis, and development and repair processes aimed at the restoration of homeostasis. Cytokines are released by various cells in the body, usually in response to an activating stimulus, and they induce responses through binding to specific receptors on the cell surface of target cells. Cytokines can be grouped by structure into different families and their receptors can likewise be grouped.",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting various pathogens and generating innate immune responses. The intracellular NOD-like receptor (NLR) family contains more than 20 members in mammals and plays a pivotal role in the recognition of intracellular ligands. NOD1 and NOD2, two prototypic NLRs, sense the cytosolic presence of the bacterial peptidoglycan fragments that escaped from endosomal compartments, driving the activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, cytokine production and apoptosis. On the other hand, a different set of NLRs induces caspase-1 activation through the assembly of multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. These NLRs include NALP1, NALP3 and Ipaf. The inflammasomes are critical for generating mature proinflammatory cytokines in concert with Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.",
  "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was first identified by virtue of the essential role it plays in collagen modification, preventing the nutritional deficiency scurvy. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for hydroxylase enzymes that post-translationally modify collagen to increase the strength and elasticity of tissues. Vitamin C reduces the metal ion prosthetic groups of many enzymes, maintaining activity of enzymes, also acts as an anti-oxidant. Although the prevention of scurvy through modification of collagen may be the most obvious role for vitamin C, it is not necessarily the only role of vitamin C. Svct1 and Svct2 are ascorbate transporters for vitamin C import into tissues and into cells. Both of these transporters specifically transport reduced L-ascorbic acid against a concentration gradient using the intracellular sodium gradient to drive ascorbate transport. Svct1 is expressed in epithelial cells in the intestine, upregulated in cellular models for intestinal epithelium and appears to be responsible for the import of dietary vitamin C from the intestinal lumen. The vitamin C imported from the intestine is present in plasma at approximately 50 uM, almost exclusively in the reduced form, and is transported to tissues to play",
  "Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK",
  "TNFR2 is the receptor for the 171 amino acid 19 kD TNF (beta) (a.k.a. lymphotoxin). TNF (beta) is produced by activated lymphocytes and can be cytotoxic to many tumor and other cells. In neutrophils, endothelial cells and osteoclasts TNF (beta) can lead to activation while in many other cell types it can lead to increased expression of MHC and adhesion molecules.",
  "Five distinct stages have been proposed in the evolution of melanoma on the basis of histological criteria: common acquired and congenital nevi without dysplastic changes; dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia; radial-growth phase (RGP) melanoma; vertical-growth phase (VGP) melanoma; and metastatic melanoma. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Moreover, melanoma development is strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways. The vertical-growth phase and metastatic melanoma are notable for striking changes in the control of cell adhesion. Recently, amplification of the MITF gene was demonstrated in 10% of primary melanomas and 20% of metastatic melanomas, suggesting that MITF is a melanoma oncogene.",
  "Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the control of translation by eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). eIF-2 binds GTP and Met-tRNAi and transfers the Met-tRNA to the 40S subunit, to form the 43S preinitiation complex. Later in the cycle, prior to elongation, the bound GTP is hydrolyzed, releasing eIF-2-GDP. For eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, GDP must be exchanged for GTP, a reaction catalyzed by eIF-2B. Kinases activated by viral infection (PKR), endoplasmic reticulum stress (PERK / PEK), amino acid deprivation (GCN2), and hemin deficiency (HRI) can phosphorylate the a subunit of eIF-2. This phosphorylation stabilizes the eIF-2-GDP-eIF-2B complex, inhibiting the turnover of eIF-2B. eIF-2B is also inhibited by GSK-3b phosphorylation. These events result in a shut-down of cellular protein synthesis and can lead to apoptosis.",
  "The insulin resistance of type II diabetes appears to be caused in part by the presence of high levels of lipids in cells such as skeletal muscle where this would not normally be found. The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import",
  "Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts at synapses through binding to ligand-gated ion channels, the GABA receptors. Clustering of the GABA-A receptor chloride channel alters receptor pharmacology on the cell surface and reduced clustering of the GABA receptor is associated with anxiety. GABA-A interacts with several proteins that modulate its clustering, endocytosis, and recycling or degradation. Plic-1 is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to GABA-A receptors and causes them to accumulate at inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of GABA-A, and with microtubules, bringing receptors together in plasma microdomains. Curiously, Gephyrin appears to be a bifunctional protein, with a domain involved in molybdenum metabolism. Another protein interacting with the GABA-A receptor is GABARAP, a microtubule-associated protein. Anchoring of the GABA-A receptor to GABARAP helps to cluster the receptor at the synaptic termini and to mediate fast synaptic transmission. GABARAP may mediate interaction of gephyrin with the GABA-A receptor and gephyrin may stabilize clusters by forming multimeric structures. GABARAP and gephyrin may play more",
  "Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would",
  "The T Cell Receptor plays a key role in the immune system. The specificity of the receptor is governed by the binding site formed from the mature alpha and beta chains (shown here) or gamma and delta chains in gamma / delta T Cells. It is the ability of this receptor to bind a complex of foreign peptide in the groove of an MHC molecule that leads to T cell activation. Upon activation the T cell can assist in activating other cells or carry out cytolytic attacks depending on the particular T cell type. The CD3 complex and CD4 (Th cells) or CD8 (Tc cells) work to transmit the activation signal to the T cell's transcriptional machinary upon engagement of the receptor.",
  "Lipopolysaccharide. One of the key actions of AKT is to block apoptosis. AKT phosphorylation of NF-kB promotes the survival and activation of macrophages responding to LPS. Another substrate of AKT is the protein kinase Gsk3-beta. AKT phosphorylates and deactivates Gsk3-beta. Non-phosphorylated Gsk3-beta is active and phosphorylates beta-catenin, leading to its degradation in the ubiquitin dependent proteosome pathway. Stimulation by LPS causes the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus and the activation of genes in concert with the transcription factor LEF1. This pathway is probably not restricted to alveolar pathway, but leads to the activation of beta-catenin dependent genes by LPS in other cells as well. Other pathways regulate this pathway also, such as the modulation of PI3 kinase activity by ceramide, and the inhibition of Gsk3-beta activity by the Wnt / frizzled / disheveled (DSH) pathway.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a broad range of cellular and physiological responses. In addition to playing a role in inflammation and hematopoiesis, IL-6 is involved in other processes such as neuronal differentiation and bone loss. To produce these effects IL-6 signals through a receptor composed of two different subunits, an alpha subunit that produces ligand specificity and gp130, a receptor subunit shared in common with other cytokines in the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT3, that move into the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing STAT3 response elements. The ras-mediated pathway, acting through Shc, Grb-2 and Sos-1 upstream and activating Map kinases downstream, activates transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-IL-6 (C / EBP-beta) that can act through their own cognate response elements in the genome. These factors and other transcription factors like AP-1 and SRF (",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",
  "p27 / Kip1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase cdk2 / cyclin E and blocking cell cycle progression through the G1-S transition. Cancer cells in some cases have reduced levels of p27, supporting the importance of p27 in cell cycle regulation. The activity of p27 is regulated by phosphorylation, synthesis and degradation. Phosphorylation of p27 at threonine-187 by cdk2 causes p27 to associate with an SCF complex that targets p27 for proteolytic degradation. The F box protein Skp2 binds specifically to threonine-187 phosphorylated p27, recruiting it to the SCF complex for degradation. Other components of the p27 ubiquitin ligase complex include Skp1, Cul1, and Roc1 / Rbx-1. Cks-1 has also been identified in a reconstituted system as an essential component for recruitment of p27 for degradation by the SCF complex. Signaling by cytokines may modulate cell survival, proliferation, or apoptosis through modulation of p27 expression. Cytokine and AKT signaling pathways activate forkhead transcription factors that induce p27 expression at the transcriptional",
  "The innate immune response responds in a general manner to factors present in invading pathogens. Bacterial factors such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin), bacterial lipoproteins, peptidoglycans and also CpG nucleic acids activate innate immunity as well as stimulating the antigen-specific immune response and triggering the inflammatory response. Members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) gene family convey signals stimulated by these factors, activating signal transduction pathways that result in transcriptional regulation and stimulate immune function. TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipoproteins, TLR4 is activated by LPS, and TLR9 is activated by CpG DNA; peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is activated by peptidoglycan (PGN). The downstream signaling pathways used by these receptors are similar to that used by the IL-1 receptor, activating the IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) through the MyD88 adaptor protein, and signaling through TRAF-6 and protein kinase cascades to activate NF-kB and Jun. NF-kB and c-Jun activate transcription of genes such as the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-12. Several recent reports have suggested that the functional outcomes of signaling via",
  "Macrophages and NK cells help provide innate immunity against infection by intracellular parasites and communicate with each other to regulate this process. When stimulated, macrophages secrete the cytokine IL-12 that is essential for activation of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. IL-12 stimulates this NK cell response through activation of a JAK / STAT signaling pathway. Binding of IL-12 to its receptor on NK cells causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and another JAK kinase, Tyk2. Tyk2 in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT4, which can then translocate to the nucleus to activate genes, including the expression of interferon-gamma. IFN-gamma and IL-12 induce the differentiation of TH1 helper T cells that activate macrophages through interferon-gamma. A key modulator of NK cell activation by IL-12 is nitric oxide, NO, produced from arginine by the inducible nitric oxide synthase NOS2. Inactivation of the NOS2 gene in mice impairs the initial innate response to infection, including the activation of NK cells. This phenotype is similar to that of mice lacking interferon-gamma or IL-12 and a",
  "This diagram is a compilation of Pyk2 effort cascades. In specific cell types the receptor and effoectors will vary. Binding of a transmembrane receptor triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1. In turn, Rac1 initiatates the JNK cascade, starting with PAK follwed by MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK. JNK activation causes induction of c-Jun gene binding. Pyk2 stimulation has also been shown to activate MKK3 leading to activation of p38. The other major mitogen activated kinase cascade for ERK1 / 2 is stimulated via RAS, RAF and MEKK1 / 2.",
  "The Fc Epsilon Receptor 1 signaling pathway in mast cells uses multiple core signal path to achieve its necessary ends. Through the BTK protein and PKC Mast cells are able to degranulate, through the PKC and MAPK paths the cells are able to alter cytokine expression and arachidonic acid release.",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "Many different peptides act as signaling molecules, including the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin, the protease enzyme thrombin, and the blood pressure regulating peptide angiotensin. While these three proteins are distinct in their sequence and physiology, and act through different cell surface receptors, they share in a common class of cell surface receptors called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other polypeptide ligands of GPCRs include vasopressin, oxytocin, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, GnRH, leutinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, orexins, urotensin II, endorphins, enkephalins, and many others. GPCRs are a broad and diverse gene family that respond not only to peptide ligands but also small molecule neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline), light, odorants, taste, lipids, nucleotides, and ions. The main signaling mechanism used by GPCRs is to interact with G-protein GTPase proteins coupled to downstream second messenger systems including intracellular calcium release and cAMP production. The intracellular signaling systems used by peptide GPCRs are similar to those used by all GPCRs, and are typically classified according to the G-protein they interact with and the second",
  "Four different members of the Sprouty protein family block the cellular proliferation and differentiation induced by several different growth factors, including EGF and FGF. One mechanism by which Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling is through binding to Grb-2, a signaling intermediary between the tyrosine kinase growth factors and the Ras / map kinase pathway. Binding of Sprouty to Grb-2 prevents Grb-2 and Sos-1 from interacting with downstream signaling factors that activate Ras and map kinases, including Ras, Raf-1, Mek1, Erk1 / 2 and downstream transcription factors. The action of Sprouty as an inhibitor of this pathway requires Sprouty phosphorylation and membrane localization, at the site of the factors it interacts with. The inhibition of growth factor signaling by Sprouty is specific to the Ras pathway since the PI3 Kinase pathway responsible for cell survival signals from growth factor receptors is not inhibited by Sprouty. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is also not affected. The mechanism by which Sprouty inhibits Ras activation may be by blocking the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. Sprouty",
  "The vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is a highly specialized cell whose principal function is contraction. On contraction, VSMCs shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure. The principal mechanisms that regulate the contractile state of VSMCs are changes in cytosolic Ca2 + concentration (c). In response to vasoconstrictor stimuli, Ca2 + is mobilized from intracellular stores and / or the extracellular space to increase c in VSMCs. The increase in c, in turn, activates the Ca2 + -CaM-MLCK pathway and stimulates MLC20 phosphorylation, leading to myosin-actin interactions and, hence, the development of contractile force. The sensitivity of contractile myofilaments or MLC20 phosphorylation to Ca2 + can be secondarily modulated by other signaling pathways. During receptor stimulation, the contractile force is greatly enhanced by the inhibition of myosin phosphatase. Rho / Rho kinase, PKC, and arachidonic acid have been proposed to play a pivotal role in this enhancement. The signaling events that mediate relaxation include the removal of a contractile agonist (passive relaxation) and activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in the continued presence of a",
  "Cell cycle checkpoint controls at the G1 to S transition and the G2 to M transition prevent the cell cycle from progressing when DNA is damaged. The ATM protein kinase detects DNA damage and in response to this activates DNA repair factors and inhibits cell cycle progression. Two of the proteins that ATM phosphorylates in response to DNA damage are the tumor suppressor p53 and the checkpoint kinase chk1. In turn, the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with p21 to block the activity of cdk2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2) preventing passage from G1 to S phase and harmful replication of damaged DNA. One of the targets of cdk2 is the Rb gene product, another tumor suppressor. When dephosphorylated, Rb interacts with E2F transcription factors and prevents transcription of genes required for progression through the cell cycle. When phosphorylated by cell cycle dependent kinases like cdk2 and cdk4, Rb no longer interacts with E2F and the cell cycle proceeds through the G1-S checkpoint. DNA damage also regulates the G2-M phase transition by acting on the cell cycle regulator cdc2.",
  "Thrombin is an extracellular protease that is involved in the clotting of blood and inflammation through its action on platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature and that plays a role in thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4. PAR1 activation may be involved in the dilation of arteries during inflammation through the action of thrombin on endothelial cells and in platelet activation by thrombin during clotting. PAR1 and PAR2 activation cause bronchodilation in airway and may protect against",
  "Ang II binding to AT1-R triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to the Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1 but not Cdc42, although the direct activation of Rac1 by Pyk2 is not proved in this study. In turn, Rac1 activates a small G protein-activated kinase whose identity is still controversial, but one of which has been suggested to be PAK1. Finally, the JNK cascade, including MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK, is activated, causing induction of c-Jun gene via binding of ATF2 and c-Jun heterodimer to the junTRE2 site. Ang II is closely involved in the cardiac remodeling by stimulating synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It was recently found that expression of fibronectin by Ang II is transcriptionally regulated by AP-1 complex in cardiac fibroblasts. Collagenase gene containg AP-1 sites is also regulated by AP-1 components including c-Jun. AP-1 activity is also enhanced in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Expression of ANF is regulated by AP-1 components.",
  "TGF-beta regulates growth and proliferation of cells, blocking growth of many cell types. The TGF-beta receptor includes type 1 and type 2 subunits that are serine-threonine kinases and that signal through the SMAD family of transcriptional regulators. Defects in TGF-beta signaling, includes mutation in SMADs, have been associated with cancer in humans. Prior to activation, receptor regulated SMADs are anchored to the cell membrane by factors like SARA (SMAD Anchor for Receptor Activation) that brings the SMADs into proximity of the TGF receptor kinases. Binding of TGF induces phosphorylation and activation of the TGF-beta R1 receptor by the TGF-beta R2 receptor. The activated TGF-beta R1 phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3, which bind to the SMAD4 mediator to move into the nucleus and form complexes that regulate transcription. SMADs regulate transcription in several ways, including binding to DNA, interacting with other transcription factors, and interacting with transcription corepressors and coactivators like p300 and CBP. SMAD-7 represses signaling by other SMADs to down-regulate the system. Other signaling pathways like the MAP kinase-ERK cascade are activated",

  "Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), potentially lethal lesions. HR takes place in the late S-G2 phase of the cell cycle and involves the generation of a single-stranded region of DNA, followed by strand invasion, formation of a Holliday junction, DNA synthesis using the intact strand as a template, branch migration and resolution. It is investigated that RecA / Rad51 family proteins play a central role. The breast cancer susceptibility protein Brca2 and the RecQ helicase BLM (Bloom syndrome mutated) are tumor suppressors that maintain genome integrity, at least in part, through HR.",
  "Approximately 30% of breast carcinomas lack ER expression. Presumably, these breast cancers become estrogen independent through genetic alterations that bypass the requirement for ER-dependent stimulation of cell proliferation. As such estrogen receptor is a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelia and represents a crucial prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression through direct gene activation of a number of genes (cathepsin D, HSP27 (heat shock protein 27,000 kDa, aldolase A, dehydrogenase, alpha-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphat, Pdzk1, Greb ets) and also through the biological functions of target loci. The product of human MTA3 has been identified as an estrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2 / NuRD transcriptional corepressor in breast epithelial cells and demonstrate that MTA3 constitutes a key component of an estrogen-dependent pathway regulating growth and differentiation. The absence of estrogen receptor or of MTA3 leads to aberrant expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Aberrant Snail expression results in loss of expression of the",

  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin. There are 4 major histologic subtypes of RCC: conventional (clear cell RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Multiple genes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for hereditary (von Hippel-Lindau) and sporadic variants of conventional (clear cell) RCC. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. An oncogene, MET has been found to be mutant in cases of hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), although the incidence of c-MET mutations is low in sporadic papillary RCC. Once activated, MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome (HLRCC",

  "Interaction of T cell receptor with specific antigen in the context of MHC II activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to T cell activation. In the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the src family kinases Lck and Fyn are activated to phosphorylate proteins in the T cell receptor complex which recruit and activate the ZAP70 kinase. The activation of ZAP70 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate MAP kinase pathways and cause T cell activation. The CD45 phosphorylase also plays a role in T cell receptor signaling, dephosphorylated Lck and Fyn to activate them. Other factors modulate T cell receptor activation. Csk (COOH-terminal Srk kinase) phosphorylates Lck and deactivates it, opposing the action of CD45. The phosphorylation of Lck by Csk inhibits T cell receptor signaling and inhibits T cell activation. Csk activity is regulated in T cells by PKA, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated by the second messenger cAMP. The activity of Csk also appears to depend on other factors such as CBP, which recruits Csk to the plasma membrane in lipid rafts where other signaling factors such the T cell receptor complex are localized. CBP also directly activates Csk.",
  "Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling pathways in mast cells are initiated by the interaction of antigen (Ag) with IgE bound to the extracellular domain of the alpha chain of Fc epsilon RI. The activation pathways are regulated both positively and negatively by the interactions of numerous signaling molecules. Mast cells that are thus activated release preformed granules which contain biogenic amines (especially histamines) and proteoglycans (especially heparin). The activation of phospholipase A2 causes the release of membrane lipids followed by development of lipid mediators such as leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) and prostaglandins (especially PDG2). There is also secretion of cytokines, the most important of which are TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5. These mediators and cytokines contribute to inflammatory responses.",
  "BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified genetically as breast cancer susceptibility genes when a single copy of the gene is mutated and are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, including blocking cell cycle progression and inducing DNA repair to preserve the integrity of the genome during cell division. BRCA1 and BRCA2 induce double-stranded repair of breaks using homologous recombination, in part through activation of RAD51. BRCA1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase targeting the protein FancD2 that activates checkpoint control, integrating the ATM response to ionizing radiation and the FA response to cross-linking agents like mitomycin C. Mutation of one of the several components of the FA complex involved in maintaining integrity of the genome leads to the condition Fanconi anemia. One member of the FA complex was recently identified as BRCA2, which leads to Fanconi anemia when both copies of the gene are mutated. Another related factor involved in the response of cells to DNA damage is the kinase ATM. ATM is mutated in patients with AT, a condition with many similar traits to Fanconi anemia. Like ATM, ATR serves as a checkpoint kinase that halts cell cycle progression and induces DNA repair when DNA is damaged. Loss",

Leptin is an important regulator of energy intake and metabolic rate primarily by acting at hypothalamic nuclei. Leptin exerts its anorectic effects by modulating the levels of neuropeptides such as NPY, AGRP, and alpha-MSH. This leptin action is through the JAK kinase, STAT3 phosphorylation, and nuclear transcriptional effect. Adiponectin lowers plasma glucose and FFAs. These effects are partly accounted for by adiponectin-induced AMPK activation, which in turn stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake. Furthermore, activation of AMPK by adiponectin suppresses endogenous glucose production, concomitantly with inhibition of PEPCK and G6Pase expression. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha has been implicated as a link between obesity and insulin resistance. TNFalpha interferes with early steps of insulin signaling. Several data have shown that TNFalpha inhibits IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation by promoting its serine phosphorylation. Among the serine / threonine kinases activated by TNFalpha, JNK, mTOR and IKK have been shown to be involved in this phosphorylation.",
  "Lipopolysaccharide. One of the key actions of AKT is to block apoptosis. AKT phosphorylation of NF-kB promotes the survival and activation of macrophages responding to LPS. Another substrate of AKT is the protein kinase Gsk3-beta. AKT phosphorylates and deactivates Gsk3-beta. Non-phosphorylated Gsk3-beta is active and phosphorylates beta-catenin, leading to its degradation in the ubiquitin dependent proteosome pathway. Stimulation by LPS causes the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus and the activation of genes in concert with the transcription factor LEF1. This pathway is probably not restricted to alveolar pathway, but leads to the activation of beta-catenin dependent genes by LPS in other cells as well. Other pathways regulate this pathway also, such as the modulation of PI3 kinase activity by ceramide, and the inhibition of Gsk3-beta activity by the Wnt / frizzled / disheveled (DSH) pathway.",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "Five distinct stages have been proposed in the evolution of melanoma on the basis of histological criteria: common acquired and congenital nevi without dysplastic changes; dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia; radial-growth phase (RGP) melanoma; vertical-growth phase (VGP) melanoma; and metastatic melanoma. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Moreover, melanoma development is strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways. The vertical-growth phase and metastatic melanoma are notable for striking changes in the control of cell adhesion. Recently, amplification of the MITF gene was demonstrated in 10% of primary melanomas and 20% of metastatic melanomas, suggesting that MITF is a melanoma oncogene.",
  "Cell cycle checkpoint controls at the G1 to S transition and the G2 to M transition prevent the cell cycle from progressing when DNA is damaged. The ATM protein kinase detects DNA damage and in response to this activates DNA repair factors and inhibits cell cycle progression. Two of the proteins that ATM phosphorylates in response to DNA damage are the tumor suppressor p53 and the checkpoint kinase chk1. In turn, the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with p21 to block the activity of cdk2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2) preventing passage from G1 to S phase and harmful replication of damaged DNA. One of the targets of cdk2 is the Rb gene product, another tumor suppressor. When dephosphorylated, Rb interacts with E2F transcription factors and prevents transcription of genes required for progression through the cell cycle. When phosphorylated by cell cycle dependent kinases like cdk2 and cdk4, Rb no longer interacts with E2F and the cell cycle proceeds through the G1-S checkpoint. DNA damage also regulates the G2-M phase transition by acting on the cell cycle regulator cdc2.",
  "The defects in cAMP-regulated chloride channel CTFR are believed to be the major cause for cystic fibrosis. Regulation of CFTR protein by the surface receptor beta adrenergic receptor is mediated through the ezrin / radixin / moesin binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), which binds both the C-termini CFTR and b2AR through their PDZ binding motifs. In the resting state, CFTR, b2AR, and EBP50 exist as a macromolecular complex on the apical surface of epithelial cells. Upon agonist activation of the b2AR, the adenulate cyclase is stimulated through the G protein pathway, leading to an increase in cAMP. The elevated concentration of cAMP activates PKA, which is anchored near CFTR via interaction with Ezrin. The phosphorylation of CFTR by PKA disrupts the complex and leads to compartmentalized and specific signaling of the channel.",
  "Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps known as G1 and G2 phases. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage, the checkpoint kinase ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. p5",
  "E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2 / cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2 / cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2 / cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S / G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical,",
  "Primary immunodeficiencies (PIs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which affect cellular and humoral immunity or non-specific host defense mechanisms mediated by complement proteins, and cells such as phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. These disorders of the immune system cause increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy. Most of PIs are due to genetic defects that affect cell maturation or function at different levels during hematopoiesis. Disruption of the cellular immunity is observed in patients with defects in T cells or both T and B cells. These cellular immunodeficiencies comprise 20% of all PIs. Disorders of humoral immunity affect B-cell differentiation and antibody production. They account for 70% of all PIs.",
  "Contraction of the heart is a complex process initiated by the electrical excitation of cardiac myocytes (excitation-contraction coupling, ECC). In cardiac myocytes, Ca2 + influx induced by activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (DHP receptors) upon membrane depolarization triggers the release of Ca2 + via Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through a Ca2 + -induced Ca release (CICR) mechanism. Ca2 + ions released via the CICR mechanism diffuse through the cytosolic space to contractile proteins to bind to troponinC resulting in the release of inhibition induced by troponinI. The Ca2 + binding to troponinC thereby triggers the sliding of thin and thick filaments, that is, the activation of a crossbridge and subsequent cardiac force development and / or cell shortening. Recovery occurs as Ca2 + is pumped out of the cell by the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) or is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by sarco (endo) plasmic Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) pumps on the non-junctional region of the SR.",
  "The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily contains several members with homologous cytoplasmic domains known as death domains (DD). The intracellular DD are important in initiating apoptosis and other signaling pathways following ligand binding by the receptors.1 In the absence of ligand, DD-containing receptors are maintained in an inactive state. TNF RI contains a cytoplasmic DD required for signaling pathways associated with apoptosis and NF-kB activation.2,3 Jiang et al.4 identified a widely expressed 60 kDa protein, named SODD (silencer of death domains), associated with the DD of TNF RI and DR3. Overexpression of SODD suppresses TNF-induced cell death and NF-kB activation demonstrating its role as a negative regulatory protein for these signaling pathways. TNF-induced receptor trimerization aggregates the DD of TNF RI and recruits the adapter protein TRADD.3,5 This in turn promotes the recruitment of the DD-containing cytoplasmic proteins FADD, TRAF2 and RIP to form an active TNF RI signaling complex (Figure 1A) .6-9 In contrast, SODD acts as a silencer of TNF RI signaling and does not interact with TRADD,",
  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1 (a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1), parkin, DJ1 (a parkin-associated protein involved with oxidative stress), and PINK1 (a putative serine threonine kinase) are known to cause early-onset PD. Mutations or altered expression of these proteins contributes to PD pathogenesis through common mechanisms that result in proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress. Point mutations in alpha-synuclein and the recently described Iowan functional duplication of alpha-synuclein lead to excessive intracellular accumulation and protofibril formation. Decrease in the amount of soluble alpha-synuclein tends to increase free cytoplasmic dopamine and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, formation of protofibrils or aggregates and Lewy bodies (LBs) diminishes the availability of the physiological forms of alpha-synuclein, favoring an increase in TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) and DAT (dopamine transporter), but diminishes vesicles formation and neuronal plasticity. Modification of parkin and UCHL1 are associated with the",
  "Many transcription factors play essential roles in normal development by determining the proliferation and differentiation of cells. The coordinated transcriptional control of proliferation in specific developmental cell types is crucial in multiple developmental settings. One of a family of three bicoid-related transcription factors, Pitx2 acts downstream of the extracellular signaling protein Wnt to drive proliferation of cells with specific developmental fates, including cells in the pituitary, cardiac outflow region, and muscle. Wnt binds to Frizzled, a G-protein coupled receptor, activating homologs of the Drosophila Disheveled protein. Activation of Frizzled and Disheveled inhibits the kinase GSK-3 beta, part of a protein complex in the absence of Wnt signaling, causing beta-catenin protein to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Beta-catenin is known to alter the function of transcription factors like TCF / Lef. One result of Wnt signaling is activation of the transcription factor Lef by beta-catenin, inducing Pitx2 expression. Wnt activation also changes Pitx2 from a repressor to an activator by causing transcriptional corepressors like histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) bound to Pitx2 to be exchanged for coactivators. With coactivators bound",

  "HIV infection leads to drastic declines in CD4 T helper cells, in part through apoptosis of uninfected cells. Apoptosis of uninfected cells may be induced through the expression of Fas ligand on the surface of HIV-infected cells, stimulating the Fas-dependent apoptotic pathway in cells that come in contact with infected cells. The NEF protein expressed by HIV may play induce the expression of Fas-ligand by infected cells. If this is the case, then a question that arises is how infected cells themselves escape Fas-mediated apoptosis. The NEF protein appears to play a role in this process as well. NEF interacts with the ASK1 kinase (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase) involved in apoptotic signaling by TNF and Fas-ligand. Interaction of NEF with ASK1 prevents phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases and JNK kinases involved in apoptotic signaling.",
  "The correct processing, quality control and turnover of cellular RNA molecules are critical to many aspects in the expression of genetic information. In eukaryotes, two major pathways of mRNA decay exist and both pathways are initiated by poly (A) shortening of the mRNA. In the 5 'to 3' pathway, this is followed by decapping which then permits the 5 'to 3' exonucleolytic degradation of transcripts. In the 3 'to 5' pathway, the exosome, a large multisubunit complex, plays a key role. The exosome exists in archaeal cells, too. In bacteria, endoribonuclease E, a key enzyme involved in RNA decay and processing, organizes a protein complex called degradosome. RNase E or R interacts with the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, DEAD-box helicases, and additional factors in the RNA-degrading complex.",
  "In the kidney, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) is a critical regulator of water homeostasis by controlling the water movement from lumen to the interstitium for water reabsorption and adjusting the urinary water excretion. In normal physiology, AVP is secreted into the circulation by the posterior pituitary gland, in response to an increase in serum osmolality or a decrease in effective circulating volume. When reaching the kidney, AVP binds to V2 receptors on the basolateral surface of the collecting duct epithelium, triggering a G-protein-linked signaling cascade, which leads to water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) vesicle insertion into the apical plasma membrane. This results in higher water permeability in the collecting duct and, driven by an osmotic gradient, pro-urinary water then passes the membrane through AQP2 and leaves the cell on the basolateral side via AQP3 and AQP4 water channels, which are constitutively expressed on the basolateral side of these cells. When isotonicity is restored, reduced blood AVP levels results in AQP2 internalization, leaving the apical membrane watertight again.",
  "The PML nuclear bodies are ring-shaped nuclear substructures associated with the regulation of transcription, transformation, cell growth, and apoptosis and are characterized by the presence of the protein PML. The activities of PML as a tumor suppressor and apoptosis inducing factor are exerted through the numerous proteins it interacts with in the PML-nuclear bodies including the tumor suppressor p53. DNA damage induced activation of p53-dependent apoptosis requires PML. PML acts as a coactivator for p53 and increases acetylation of p53 by the transcriptional coactivator CBP. This acetylation of p53 is reversed by the deacetylase SirT1, the human homolog of the yeast gene Sir2, and this deacetylation opposes the transcriptional activation of p53. The tumor suppressor Rb also interacts with the PML nuclear body, increasing transcriptional repression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, suggesting that PML may affect cellular transformation through more than one mechanism. PML interacts directly with Ubc9, which modifies PML through the attachment of the ubiquitin-like peptide Sumo-1. Sumo-1 modification of PML is not necessary for the nuclear bodies to form, but may",

  "Stathmin is a ubiquitous, cytosolic 19-kDa protein, which is phosphorylated on up to four sites in response to many regulatory signals within cells. Its molecular characterization indicates a functional organization including an N-terminal regulatory domain that bears the phosphorylation sites, linked to a putative alpha-helical binding domain predicted to participate in coiled-coil, protein-protein interactions. In addtion to the protein kinases that phospjhorylate Stathmin such as CaMK, MAPK, p34cdc2, PKA, a few other proteins have been suggested to interact with stathmin in vivo. One of them was identified as BiP, a member of the hsp70 heat-shock protein family. Another is a previously unidentified, putative serine / threonine kinase, KIS, which might be regulated by stathmin or, more likely, be part of the kinases controlling its phosphorylation state. Finally, two proteins, CC1 and CC2, predicted to form alpha-helices participating in coiled-coil interacting structures. It has been also suggest that the action of antimicrotubule drugs can be affected by stathmin in at least two ways: (a",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "The motor defects of Parkinson's disease are related to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in specific brain regions. Examination of these neurons in diseased tissue has revealed the presence of Lewy bodies, dense aggregates that include the protein alpha-synuclein. A genetic basis for most cases of Parkinson's disease has not yet been identified, but mutations in alpha-synuclein have been associated with at least one rare form of the disease, and mutations in another protein, the parkin gene, are associated with another inherited form of Parkinson's disease. Parkin is found in Lewy bodies along with alpha-synuclein and the parkin protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Parkin appears to work in conjuction with ubiquitin activating (Uba) 1, an E1 protein and the ubiquitin-conjugating (Ubc) enzymes UbcH7 and 8. The E1 delivers ubiquitin to the E2 in a cycle that creates an increasing chain of ubiquitin. The Parkin E3 ligates this onto substrates and so tags these proteins in normal cells, targeting them for destruction in the proteosome. One of the proteins that parkin normally targets for destruction is a specific O-glycosylated form of alpha-",
  "The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of a complex mixture of structural and functional macromolecules and serves an important role in tissue and organ morphogenesis and in the maintenance of cell and tissue structure and function. Specific interactions between cells and the ECM are mediated by transmembrane molecules, mainly integrins and perhaps also proteoglycans, CD36, or other cell-surface-associated components. These interactions lead to a direct or indirect control of cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In addition, integrins function as mechanoreceptors and provide a force-transmitting physical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Integrins are a family of glycosylated, heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that consist of noncovalently bound alpha- and beta-subunits.",
  "RhoA is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell morphology via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. The majority of RhoA activations is due to disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell morphology. RhoA is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. The RhoGAP ARHGAP1 also acts as a GAP for Rac and CDC42. Active RhoA increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several different factors downstream of RhoA act on cytoskeletal structures to affect stability of these structures. Rock1 provides a direct link from RhoA to cell morphology through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Rock1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses this activity. According to Nimnual et al. Rho activity is reduced as a result of Rac-induced redox-dependent inhibition. Related Disease: Non-syndromic deafness appears to be",

  "Terminal differentiation of cells is often accompanied by repression of cellular proliferation, suggesting that there is a mechanism by which these cellular functions are coordinated. Macrophage differentiation is one model system in which this occurs; as macrophages differentiate, they also stop proliferating. Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in cell cycle progression as well as many differentiation processes. Ras stimulates cell cycle progression in part through Ets transcription factors that bind to cell cycle regulatory genes to activate their expression. Ets transcription factors also help to induce early macrophage differentiation. The activation of Ras signaling by M-CSF activates transcription of genes involved in differentiation through the coordinate expression of both Ets factors and AP-1. Other genes involved in cell cycle regulation involved the coordinate action of E2F-1 and Ets transcription factors. Mets is a factor related in sequence to Ets2 that is upregulated during macrophage differentiation. Increased expression of the Mets protein during macrophage differentiation allows the creation of heterodimers with DP103 to act as transcriptional repressors of cell cycle progression genes, recruiting corepressor to promoters they interact with. DP103 is a gene previously identified as an RNA helicase involved in RNA",
  "Glycolysis is the process of converting glucose into pyruvate and generating small amounts of ATP (energy) and NADH (reducing power). It is a central pathway that produces important precursor metabolites: six-carbon compounds of glucose-6P and fructose-6P and three-carbon compounds of glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate. Acetyl-CoA, another important precursor metabolite, is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. When the enzyme genes of this pathway are examined in completely sequenced genomes, the reaction steps of three-carbon compounds from glycerone-P to pyruvate form a conserved core module, which is found in almost all organisms and which often corresponds to operon structures in bacterial genomes. Gluconeogenesis is a synthesis pathway of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors. It is essentially a reversal of glycolysis with minor variations of alternative paths.",
  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",
  "Phagocytosis plays an essential role in host-defense mechanisms through the uptake and destruction of infectious pathogens. Specialized cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes take part in this process in higher organisms. After opsonization with antibodies (IgG), foreign extracellular materials are recognized by Fc gamma receptors. Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors initiates a variety of signals mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, which lead through the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and membrane remodeling to the formation of phagosomes. Nascent phagosomes undergo a process of maturation that involves fusion with lysosomes. The acquisition of lysosomal proteases and release of reactive oxygen species are crucial for digestion of engulfed materials in phagosomes.",
  "NK (natural killer) cells are lymphocytes distinct from B and T cells that induce perforin-mediated lysis of tumor cells and virus-infected cells. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is activated by glycoproteins on the cell surface (activating receptors) and inhibited by MHC-1 with self-peptide bound. The MHC-1 inhibitory signal through Ig-family or lectin receptors prevents NK cells from killing normal cells. Abnormal MHC-1 expression in infected or tumor cells results in the release of perforin, the lysis of the abnormal cell and the release of cytokines that stimulate the immune response. MAP kinase inhibitors but not ras inhibitors are able to block NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating that the pathway can function by a ras-independent manner that involves the MAP kinase pathway. This pathway includes phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) as a key component, followed by Rac1 and the exchange factor Vav. The tyrosine kinase SYK and LAT may provide an additional pathway for activation of MAP kinases leading to NK cell activation, and also Pyk-2 activation by integrins. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 appears to mediate the cytotoxicity inhibitory signal that blocks lysis",
  "The complement cascade of proteolytic factors involved in cellular lysis can be initiated by several different factors, including antibody-dependent and antibody-independent recognition of infectious organisms. In the lectin-induced complement cascade, carbohydrates on the surface of microbial cells activate the complement cascade by binding to mannan-binding lectin (also called the mannan-binding protein, Mbl / Mbp). Mbp is an acute phase serum protein whose expression is induced by microbial infection. The binding of Mbl to microbial ligands activates the Mbl associated serine proteases Masp1 and Masp2, triggering the cleavage of C2 and C4 to create C4bC2a, a C3 convertase that cleaves large numbers of C3. Masp1 and Masp2 are similar to the C1 protease in the classical complement pathway. Once formed the C3 convertase cleaves and activates the remaining complement factors leading ultimately to formation of a pore in the bacterial membrane by the membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses the bacterial cell. The lectin-induced pathway also appears to play an important role of the activation of phagocytotic cells by infection. Although the initiating event activating the",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an example of lipid messengers with both intracellular and extracellular functions. Intracellularly S1P regulates proliferation and survival; extracellularly S1P is a ligand for EDG1 (also known as S1P1). Activation of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, increases cellular levels of S1P. Inhibitors of SPHK block formation of S1P and inhibit cellular proliferation induced by a variety of factors, including as an example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PMA. In a study using endothelial cells it was demonstrated that S1P induces activation of alpha-v and B3 integrins via RhoA. S1P also activates Akt via Gi and PI3K. The activated Akt phosphorlyates the Edg1 receptor on threonine 236 leading to the activation of Rac1 and subsequent signals leading to actin assembly, chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation. Edg1 stimulation also leads to the activation of the ERK signaling cascade resulting in anti-apoptotic reversal, proliferation and cell survival.",
  "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units and form proteglycans by covalently attaching to their core proteins. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit GalNAc (b1-4) GlcA (b1-3), modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates. CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues. The assembly process of CS is initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization step is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both b13 glucuronosyltransferase and b14 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities.

  "Hypertrophy associated with both hypertension and obstruction to ventricular outflow leads to pathologic cardiac growth and it is associated with increase morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic ventricular disease takes a growing toll on the health of nations. As other cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infraction are in decline as causes of mortality, the heart failure problem becomes increasingly urgent. Congenital heart defects occur in 1% of live births and fetal heart malformations are implicated in many pregnancies that end in still-birth or spontaneous abortion. The current paradigm suggests that the heart adapts to excess of hemodynamic loading by compensatory hypertrophy, which under condition of persistent stress, over time evolves into dysfunction and myocardial failure. There is considerable evidence that direct effects of increased mechanical stress are sensed within the ventricular wall and that signals critical for the generation of growth responses. Despite compelling statistics we still do not understand biochemically why heart defects are so prevalent. A single transcriptional regulator initially associated with the activation of the T-cells",
  "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is associated with gamma secretase activity that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin-1 is also a component in gamma-secretase activity involved in signaling by the transmembrane protein Notch. Active gamma secretase requires PS-1 N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment and is unique in catalyzing proteolysis within the transmembrane region of proteins. Other proteins such as nicastrin may also be components of the gamma-secretase. Binding of the ligand Delta by Notch appears to trigger two proteolytic cleavages of Notch. The first step cleaves an extracellular domain and is catalyzed by a metalloprotease termed alpha-secretase or TACE. The second cleavage step appears to occur within the transmembrane domain of Notch, and releases a Notch intracellular doman (NICD). Once released, NICD moves into the nucleus where it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CSL family transcription factors (CBF1, Su (H), Lag-1) or other transcriptional regulators such as LEF-1. Presenilin is also involved in the Wnt / frizzled signaling pathway through beta-",
  "Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent neoplasia originating from the thyroid epithelium, accounts for about 80% of all thyroid cancers. Chimeric oncogenes, created by chromosomal rearrangements involving prevalently RET and, to a less extent, NTRK1 loci, are implicated in the development of papillary carcinoma.These are inappropriately expressed and stimulate constitutive signaling, bypassing the need for receptor activation by growth factors. Alternatively, mutant RAS directly stimulates BRAF, whereas mutant BRAF directly stimulates MEK. Of all thyroid cancers, 15-20% are follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The most distinctive molecular features of follicular carcinoma are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR-gamma rearrangements. The PPAR-gamma rearrangement functions through a dominant-negative effect on the transcriptional activity of wild-type PPAR-gamma. The fusion oncoprotein contributes to malignant transformation by targeting several cellular pathways, some of which are normally engaged by PPAR-gamma. Most poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas are considered to derive from pre-existing well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma through additional genetic events, including beta-catenin nuclear accumulation",
  "Integrins are cell surface receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix and mediate intracellular signals in response to the extracellular matrix including cellular shape, mobility, and progression through the cell cycle. Integrins do not themselves possess a kinase domain or enzymatic activity but rely on association with other signaling molecules to transmit signals. Interactions between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton commonly take place at focal adhesions on the cell surface that contain localized concentrations of integrins, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal elements. Talin forms a direct interaction with the integrin cytoplasmic domain, and interacts with cytoskeletal elements (actin) and signaling factors. Paxillin and CAS also localize in focal adhesions and may serve as a scaffold for other integrin signaling components like FAK and src. Interaction of FAK, CAS and src may be required for integrin regulation of cell cycle progression. The CrkL adaptor protein may regulate downstream integrin signaling. Growth factor signaling pathways and the caveolin receptor exhibit important cross talk with integrin receptors in cellular responses like activation of map kinase, proliferation and motility.",
  "N-glycans or asparagine-linked glycans are major constituents of glycoproteins in eukaryotes. N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser / Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases, the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of human diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation.",
  "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units and form proteglycans by covalently attaching to their core proteins. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit GalNAc (b1-4) GlcA (b1-3), modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates. CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues. The assembly process of CS is initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization step is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both b13 glucuronosyltransferase and b14 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O sulfation and 6-O sulfation of N-",
  "Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) are composed of at least three types of transmembrane protein -occludin, claudin and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) - and a cytoplasmic 'plaque' consisting of many different proteins that form large complexes. The transmembrane proteins mediate cell adhesion and are thought to constitute the intramembrane and paracellular diffusion barriers. The cytoplasmic 'plaque' contains three major multi-protein complexes consisting largely of scaffolding proteins, the ZO protein complex, the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ complex and the PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex. The ZO protein complex appears to organize the transmembrane proteins and couple them to other cytoplasmic proteins and to actin microfilaments. Two evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, the CRB3 and PAR complexes are involved in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. Besides these three protein complexes which seem to be constitutively associated at TJs, a number of proteins with different functions has been identified at TJs. These include additional scaffolding proteins like MUPP1 and MAGI-1, adaptor proteins, transcription regulators and RNA processing factors, regulatory proteins like small GTPases and G-proteins, kinases",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The extrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to vascular walls or extravascular tissues. The damaged tissue releases tissue thromboplastin also known as tissue factor (TF). The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes as little as 15 seconds. This cascade is initiated by the activation of factor X by TF and factor VII. Activated factor X combined with factor V, factor VII and TF constitutes the prothrombin activator. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for each of these steps. The prothrombin activator in the extrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the intrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also the step leading to the activation of factor X. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin.

  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting viral pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Non-self RNA appearing in a cell as a result of intracellular viral replication is recognized by a family of cytosolic RNA helicases termed RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). The RLR proteins include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 and are expressed in both immune and nonimmune cells. Upon recognition of viral nucleic acids, RLRs recruit specific intracellular adaptor proteins to initiate signaling pathways that lead to the synthesis of type I interferon and other inflammatory cytokines, which are important for eliminating viruses.",
  "CD4 + helper T cells differentiate into distinct subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells. Th2 cells are involved in the response to extracellular helminthe parasites and allergic responses and secrete a distinct set of cytokines including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. The development and differentiation of T cells is influenced by many factors, including transcription factors such as GATA-3, a transcription factor associated with induction of Th2 cells. Factors that increase cAMP levels in Th2 cells activate p38 kinase, which phosphorylates and activates GATA-3 independently of PKA. Cells expressing GATA-3 develop the profile of Th2 cells, secreting IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. These cytokines are found in a gene cluster together and are regulated coordinately by GATA-3. Binding of GATA-3 in the regulatory regions of these genes alters chromatin structure, increasing accessibility to other transcription factors. Activation of the T cell receptor through interaction with antigen on antigen presenting cells activates NFAT and other transcription factors that cooperate with GATA-3 in inducing Th2 cell differentiation. Dominant negative GATA-3 can repress the secretion of these cytokines and block",
  "A demonstrated means to increase lifespan in a wide range of organisms is through the restriction of caloric intake. Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric",
  "Steroid hormones derived from cholesterol are a class of biologically active compounds in vertebrates. The cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 catalyzes conversion of cholesterol, a C27 compound, to the first C21 steroid, pregnenolone, which is converted by a bifunctional enzyme complex to the gestagen hormone, progesterone. Pregnenolone and progesterone are the starting materials for the three groups of steroids: C21 steroids of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, C19 steroids of androgens, and C18 steroids of estrogens. (i) Progesterone is converted by hydroxylations at carbons 21 and 11 to corticosterone, which is further modified by hydroxylation and oxydoreduction at carbon 18 to yield aldosterone, a mineralcorticoid. Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid, is formed from 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone with 11-deoxycortisol as an intermediate. (ii) Male hormone testosterone is formed from pregnenolone by two pathways, delta5 pathway via dehydroepiandrosterone and delta4 pathway via androstenedione. The enzyme CYP17A1 is responsible for the 17,20 lyase and 17alpha-hydroxylase activities in respective pathways. (iii) Female hormones estrone",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a crucial role in development of diverse animal phyla, from Drosophila to humans, regulating morphogenesis of a variety of tissues and organs. Hh signaling is also involved in control of stem cell proliferation in adult tissues and aberrant activation of the Hh pathway has been linked to multiple types of human cancer. Members of the Hh family bind to patched (ptc), thus releasing smoothened (smo) to transduce a signal. Transcriptional activation occurs through the GLI family of proteins resulting in activation of target genes.",
  "The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle",
  "Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor / X receptor (SXR / PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and",
  "Ca2 + that enters the cell from the outside is a principal source of signal Ca2 +. Entry of Ca2 + is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2 + by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2 + fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2 + -entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs). The other principal source of Ca2 + for signalling is the internal stores that are located primarily in the endoplasmic / sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER / SR), in which inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RYRs) regulate the release of Ca2 +. The principal activator of these channels is Ca2 + itself and this process",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "IL-7 is a key cytokine in the immune system, essential for normal development of B cells and T cells. Mice with the IL-7 receptor deleted lack B and T cells. Some humans with SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency disease) also have mutation of their IL-7 receptor gene leading to an absence of T cells and greatly impaired B cell production. The IL-7 receptor includes two polypeptides, a gamma chain and an alpha chain. The alpha-chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor while several other cytokines use the same gamma receptor chain as IL-7, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. Binding of IL-7 to the alpha chain leads to dimerization of the alpha and gamma chains. JAK3 associated with the gamma chain tyrosine phosphorylates the alpha chain after dimerization. The importance of JAK3 in IL-7 signaling is supported by the similarity of the immune defects in JAK3 knockout mice and IL-7 knockout mice. The phosphorylated alpha chain serves as the site for recruiting other signaling molecules to the complex to be phosphorylated and activated",

  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.",
  "IL-5 is an inflammatory signaling molecule that primarily stimulates eosinophil proliferation, maturation and activation. Eosinophils are leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses that defend against parasites and cause some aspects of asthma, allergic reactions, and perhaps autoimmune disorders. The action of IL-5 begins with an immune response in tissues, such as activation of macrophages and T cells that secrete IL-1, IL-4 and IL-6. The immune response can lead to IL-5 secretion by T cells, eosinophils and mast cells. Secreted IL-5 stimulates production and maturation of eosinophils in bone marrow that migrate to tissues in response to eotaxin and release factors that damage tissues, causing some of the undesirable consequences of inflammation. The receptor for IL-5 is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit that is required for IL-5 selective binding and a beta subunit that is also part of the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors. Binding of IL-5 to the IL-5 receptor at the cell surface activates JAK / STAT signaling pathways that regulate transcription, proliferation, and differentiation.",
  "Apoptosis is specifically induced via signaling through a family of receptors known collectively as' death receptors' including Fas, TNFR, DR3, -4 and -5. Death receptor ligands characteristically initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascades. Apo3L recruits initiator caspase 8 via the adapter protein FADD. Caspase 8 then oligomerizes and is activated via autocatalysis. Activated caspase 8 stimulates apoptosis via two parallel cascades: it directly cleaves and activates caspase-3, and it cleaves Bid (a Bcl-2 family protein). Truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria, inducing cytochrome C release, which sequentially activates caspases 9 and 3. DR-3L can deliver pro- or anti-apoptotic signals. DR-3 promote apoptosis via the adaptor proteins TRADD / FADD and the activation of caspase 8. Alternatively, apoptosis inhibited via an adaptor protein complex including RIP which activates NF-kB and induces survival genes including IAP. Induction of apoptosis via Apo2L requires caspase activity, but the adaptor requirement is unclear.",
  "Erythropoietin functions to increase the number of red blood cells. Thus, it has found utility as a drug for those needing to replenish erythrocytes for a number of reasons. The signaling mechanism includes multimerization of the receptor upon ligand binding, activation of MAPK cascade, and phosphorylation and activation of Stat5.",
  "Ras activates many signaling cascades. Here we illustrate some of the well-characterized cascades in a generic compilation of effector molecules. The effectors mediate Ras stimulation to a diverse set of cellular signals. Many of these signals are interpreted differently depending on the cell type or microenvironment receiving the stimulus. Not all of these effectors are activated in any given cell type. The primary method of activation is to promote the translocation of the molecule to the plasma membrane where additional interactions lead to the activation of the molecule. RalGDS is a Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF) for Ral but also has other independent functions. RalGDS activates RalA / B-related small GTPases. RalBP1 is a GTPase activating protein that leads to the inhibition of the Rac and CDC42 GTPases. Ral can also interact with phospholipase D1 (PLD1) that can also be activated by RhoA. Ras stimulation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3K occurs through an interaction with the p110 catalytic subunit. PI3K phosphorylates the D3 position of phosphatidylinositides. In this example Pip2 is converted to PIP3. PIP3 stimulates the AKT / PKB kinase and several of the Rac",

  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specifically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.",
  "Activation of the MAPK kinase pathway has been identified as a mechanism that integrins use to regulate gene expression leading to cell shape changes during cell spreading or migration Epithelial cells respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cause integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates the surrounding proteins (paxillin, Fyn / shc, and src) and leads to signal amplification. FAK also binds PI-3 kinase and is upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. When MAPkinase or PI-3 kinase was inhibited, actin reorganization was blocked. Src phosphorylates p190RhoGAP, inactivating its GAP function that may allow RhoGTP to stay active longer, promoting further signal amplification. Activated RhoGTP binds to downstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (p160ROCK) and p140 diaphanous (p140Dia) to increase actin polymerization and contraction. Actin reorganization assists integrin clustering, allowing more ECM binding that increase FAK phosphorylation and other signal transduction events.",
  "Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a biphasic disease, initiated by expression of the BCR / ABL fusion gene product in self-renewing, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs can differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), which then differentiate into granulocyte / macrophage progenitors (GMPs). HSCs can also differentiate into common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which are the progenitors of lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells. The initial chronic phase of CML (CML-CP) is characterized by a massive expansion of the granulocytic-cell series. Acquisition of additional genetic mutations beyond expression of BCR / ABL causes the progression of CML from chronic phase to blast phase (CML-BP), characterized by an accumulation of myeloid or lymphoid blast cells. The BCR / ABL fusion gene encodes p210BCR / ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The tyrosine kinase activity is essential for cell transformation and the cytoplasmic localization of BCR / ABL allows the assembly of phosphorylated substrates in multiprotein complexes that transmit",
  "Progression through the cell cycle is accompanied by activation of the proto-oncogene c-Src, a protein tyrosine kinase. Overexpression of Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein substrates and cellular transformation. During interphase the Src protein folds back upon itself to stay in the inactive state, with a phophotyrosine residue in one domain at Tyrosine 529 bound by an SH2 domain in the same protein. Activation of c-Src involves protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTP-alpha, or RPTP-alpha), a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic phosphatase domain. A variety of evidence has indicated that PTP-alpha dephosphorylates c-Src at Tyr529, allowing Src to open up and become activated, and that this activation occurs in association with mitosis. To activate Src, PTP-alpha must first open up the folded Src through binding itself to the phosphorylated Src domain, a process blocked by binding of Grb-2 to PTP-alpha at phosphorylated Tyr789. PTP-alpha phosphorylated at Tyr789 also binds to the Src SH2 domain, causing the Src structure to open at Src Tyr52",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A) goes by the colloquial designation p16, which is sometimes referred to as p16 (INK4). The alpha transcript of CDKN2A has been shown to encode p16 (INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the RB protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A encodes p14 (ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14 (ARF) is shorter than the corresponding mouse protein, p19 (ARF), and the 2 proteins share only 50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53 response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A and MDM2, and resulting in a distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2 / M phases. Two unrelated proteins encoded by the INK4A-ARF locus function in tumor suppression. ARF binds to MDM2 and promotes the rapid degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the E1-beta-encoded N-terminal domain of",
  "Telomeres, which define the ends of chromosomes, consist of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences loosely conserved in eukaryotes. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex (we only show a few of the components in this illustration) which in vitro recognizes a single-stranded G-rich telomere primer and adds multiple telomeric repeats to its 3-prime end by using an RNA template. Telomerase may also have a role in de novo formation of telomeres. Telomerase has been identified in many cultured cell lines and actively dividing cell types. The active reverse transcriptase component has been identified in teh TERT protein. The presence of this factor determines the availability of the telomerase function. The TERT protein has a high turnover rate and its expression is regulated by factors that promote growth (c-MYC, v-k-ras, Bcl-2 and E6) and inhibiting factors (RB and p53) that promote cell death or that block cell division. It appears that the regulation of active telomerase has many levels and can be inhibited by TEP1 not releasing TERT or by TRF1 which binds the end repeats and prevents access to the chromosome ends.

  "RhoA is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell morphology via actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. The majority of RhoA activations is due to disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell morphology. RhoA is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPs are GTPase-activating proteins. The RhoGAP ARHGAP1 also acts as a GAP for Rac and CDC42. Active RhoA increases the stability of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several different factors downstream of RhoA act on cytoskeletal structures to affect stability of these structures. Rock1 provides a direct link from RhoA to cell morphology through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Rock1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell structure, and phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase represses this activity. According to Nimnual et al. Rho activity is reduced as a result of Rac-induced redox-dependent inhibition. Related Disease: Non-syndromic deafness appears to be",
  "Sodium transport across the tight epithelia of Na + reabsorbing tissues such as the distal part of the kidney nephron and colon is the major factor determining total-body Na + levels, and thus, long-term blood pressure. Aldosterone plays a major role in sodium and potassium metabolism by binding to epithelial mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the renal collecting duct cells localized in the distal nephron, promoting sodium resorption and potassium excretion. Aldosterone enters a target cell and binds MR, which translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. Activation of MR leads to increased expression of Sgk-1, which phosphorylates Nedd4-2, an ubiquitin-ligase which targets ENAC to proteosomal degradation. Phosphorylated Nedd4-2 dissociates from ENAC, increasing its apical membrane abundance. Activation of MR also leads to increased expression of Na + / K + -ATPase, thus causing a net increase in sodium uptake from the renal filtrate. The specificity of MR for aldosterone is provided by 11beta-HSD2 by the rapid conversion of cortisol to cortisone in renal cortical collecting duct cells. Recently, besides genomic effects mediated by activated MR, rapid aldosterone actions",
  "Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps known as G1 and G2 phases. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage, the checkpoint kinase ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. p5",
  "Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in early defenses against both allogeneic (nonself) cells and autologous cells undergoing various forms of stress, such as infection with viruses, bacteria, or parasites or malignant transformation. Although NK cells do not express classical antigen receptors of the immunoglobulin gene family, such as the antibodies produced by B cells or the T cell receptor expressed by T cells, they are equipped with various receptors whose engagement allows them to discriminate between target and nontarget cells. Activating receptors bind ligands on the target cell surface and trigger NK cell activation and target cell lysis. However Inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I molecules (HLA) and inhibit killing by NK cells by overruling the actions of the activating receptors. This inhibitory signal is lost when the target cells do not express MHC class I and perhaps also in cells infected with virus, which might inhibit MHC class I exprssion or alter its conformation. The mechanism of NK cell killing is the same as that used by the cytotoxic T cells generated in an adaptive immune response; cytotoxic granules are released onto the surface of the bound",
  "The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle",
  "Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt / Ca2 + pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2 + signalling is mediated through",
  "The vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is a highly specialized cell whose principal function is contraction. On contraction, VSMCs shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure. The principal mechanisms that regulate the contractile state of VSMCs are changes in cytosolic Ca2 + concentration (c). In response to vasoconstrictor stimuli, Ca2 + is mobilized from intracellular stores and / or the extracellular space to increase c in VSMCs. The increase in c, in turn, activates the Ca2 + -CaM-MLCK pathway and stimulates MLC20 phosphorylation, leading to myosin-actin interactions and, hence, the development of contractile force. The sensitivity of contractile myofilaments or MLC20 phosphorylation to Ca2 + can be secondarily modulated by other signaling pathways. During receptor stimulation, the contractile force is greatly enhanced by the inhibition of myosin phosphatase. Rho / Rho kinase, PKC, and arachidonic acid have been proposed to play a pivotal role in this enhancement. The signaling events that mediate relaxation include the removal of a contractile agonist (passive relaxation) and activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in the continued presence of a",

  "HIV infection is associated with immunosuppression caused by a dramatic reduction in the helper T cell population. The loss of helper T cells may be caused by HIV-induced apoptosis of both infected and uninfected helper T cells. HIV uses the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor for macrophage cell entry and upregulates fas-ligand on these cells. CD4 on helper T cells is essential for viral cell entry and infection. Cross-linking of CD4 on the T cell surface may be involved in upregulation of Fas and sensitization of T cells to apoptosis induced by the Fas / Fas-ligand interaction.",
  "The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of a complex mixture of structural and functional macromolecules and serves an important role in tissue and organ morphogenesis and in the maintenance of cell and tissue structure and function. Specific interactions between cells and the ECM are mediated by transmembrane molecules, mainly integrins and perhaps also proteoglycans, CD36, or other cell-surface-associated components. These interactions lead to a direct or indirect control of cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In addition, integrins function as mechanoreceptors and provide a force-transmitting physical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Integrins are a family of glycosylated, heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that consist of noncovalently bound alpha- and beta-subunits.",
  "Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.",
  "Regulation of T cell activation is a crucial component of balanced functioning of the immune system. If the T cell response is too great and activation of self-responsive cells or unstimulated cells is not suppressed, then autoimmune disorders or tissue injury can result. Unstimulated T cells are maintained in a quiescent state and the activity of self-reactive T cells is maintained in an anergic state in which IL-2 expression is repressed. IL-2 is a cytokine with a key role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The maintenance of T cells in the anergic or unstimulated state may not involve just an absence of activation, but an active repression of IL-2 expression, T cell proliferation and activation. TGF beta may play a role in suppressing T cell activation. Tob is a factor identified recently that represses T cell activation that is a member of a family of genes with anti-proliferative properties. Tob expression is highest in unstimulated and anergic T cells, and is reduced in activated T cells. Tob interacts with the TGF activated transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD4, increasing their binding to the IL-2 promoter",
  "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units and form proteglycans by covalently attaching to their core proteins. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit GalNAc (b1-4) GlcA (b1-3), modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates. CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues. The assembly process of CS is initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization step is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both b13 glucuronosyltransferase and b14 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O sulfation and 6-O sulfation of N-",
  "IGF-1R, the type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor, mediates cell survival and growth in response to its ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. This tyrosine kinase receptor is widely expressed in many cell types and is a key mediator of growth. Overexpression or activation of IGF-1R may be involved in the proliferation of transformed cells, making inhibition of IGF-1R signaling a strategy for the development of cancer drugs. IGF-1R activates three signaling pathways that converge to phosphorylate BAD protein and block apoptosis. The first pathway activated by IGF-1R stimulates PI3-kinase and the AKT pathway to phosphorylate BAD and block apoptosis. A second pathway activated by IGF-1R involves ras mediated activation of the map kinase pathway to block apoptosis. A third pathway involves interaction of raf with mitochondria in response to IGF-1R activation. The convergence of these pathways to block apoptosis may enhance the IGF-1R response.",
  "The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily contains several members with homologous cytoplasmic domains known as death domains (DD). The intracellular DD are important in initiating apoptosis and other signaling pathways following ligand binding by the receptors.1 In the absence of ligand, DD-containing receptors are maintained in an inactive state. TNF RI contains a cytoplasmic DD required for signaling pathways associated with apoptosis and NF-kB activation.2,3 Jiang et al.4 identified a widely expressed 60 kDa protein, named SODD (silencer of death domains), associated with the DD of TNF RI and DR3. Overexpression of SODD suppresses TNF-induced cell death and NF-kB activation demonstrating its role as a negative regulatory protein for these signaling pathways. TNF-induced receptor trimerization aggregates the DD of TNF RI and recruits the adapter protein TRADD.3,5 This in turn promotes the recruitment of the DD-containing cytoplasmic proteins FADD, TRAF2 and RIP to form an active TNF RI signaling complex (Figure 1A) .6-9 In contrast, SODD acts as a silencer of TNF RI signaling and does not interact with TRADD,",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "D4-GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) is a negative regulator of the ras related Rho Family of GTPases. Since the rho GTPases promote cytoskeletal and membrane changes associated with apoptotic cell death, the removal of the D4-GDI block through its cleavage is important for inducing apoptosis. Caspase-3 cleaves the 28 kDa mature form of D4-GDI to give a 5 kDa and 23 kDa Size fragment. The 23 kDa fragment then translocates to the nucleus. The mechanisms involving cleavage of D4-GDI with apoptosis are not presently known. Activation of the Jun N-Terminal kinase, a regulator of apoptosis, may be one of the mechanisms.",
  "Xenopus oocytes are naturally arrested at G2 of meiosis I. Exposure to either insulin / IGF-1 or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks this arrest and induces resumption of the two meiotic division cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg. This process is termed oocyte maturation. The transition is accompanied by an increase in maturation promoting factor (MPF or Cdc2 / cyclin B) which precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Most reports point towards the Mos-MEK1-ERK2 pathway and the polo-like kinase / CDC25 pathway as responsible for the activation of MPF in meiosis, most likely triggered by a decrease in cAMP.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), a multi-functional kinase, and its neuron-specific activator p35 are required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Proteolytic cleavage of p35 produces p25, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conversion of p35 to p25 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5 and the hyperphosphorylates tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments and promotes apoptosis. In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress and calcium influx induce the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates, addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific inhibitors of calpain1, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In vitro, calpain1 directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative molecular mass 25,000. Application of the amyloid beta-peptide A beta induces the conversion of p35 to p25 in primary cortical neurons. Inhibition of cdk5 or calpain activity reduces cell death in A beta-treated cortical",
  "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide induces cellular proliferation through the EGF receptor, which has a tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain involved in EGF binding and receptor dimerization. Inhibitors of the EGF receptor are being pursued as potential cancer therapies and EGF may stimulate wound healing. Mutation of the EGF receptor has been associated with cancer in humans. The proliferative effects of EGF are signaled through several pathways. Binding of EGF results in EGF receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. The EGF receptor activates ras and the MAP kinase pathway, ultimately causing phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Fos to create AP-1 and ELK-1 that contribute to proliferation. Activation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 transcription factors by JAK kinases in response to EGF contributes to proliferative signaling. Phosphatidylinositol signaling and calcium release induced by EGF activate protein kinase C, another component of EGF signaling. Crosstalk of EGF signaling with other pathways make the EGF receptor a junction point between signaling systems.",
  "Heart formation is cued by a combination of positive and negative signals from surrounding tissues. Inhibitory signals that block heart formation in anterior paraxial mesoderm include Wnt family members expressed in dorsal neural tube and anti-BMPs expressed in the axial tissues (i.e., noggin in the notochord). Wnt signalling pathway, which is essential for setting up the entire body pattern during embryonic development involves glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3 is active and phosphorylates b-catenin resulting in its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits GSK3, thereby preventing phosphorylation of b-catenin, which is then able to move to the nucleus. There it associates with members of the LEF-1 / TCF family of transcription factors, which activate the transcription of genes like cyclin-D1, myc, and MMPs. The Wnt signaling pathway is blocked by a family of secreted proteins such as crescent and Dkk-1 sufficient for induction of heart formation in posterior mesoderm. BMP signaling can also be blocked by the BMP antagonists noggin and chordin, which are secreted from the notochord and cooperate",
  "The cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. This transition is regulated by the checkpoint kinase cdk2 that activates the G1 to S transition when it is associated with cyclin E. Cdk2 / Cyclin E causes the G1 to S transition through phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor Rb, releasing the transcription factor E2F-1. Other pathways acting through Rac, Ras and Rho also regulate the G1 to S transition. Ras regulates cyclin D1 expression to affect the G1 to S transition. Transforming forms of Ras or Raf induce cyclin D1 expression and cause early entry into S phase. Signaling from Ras to Raf to MEK to ERKs induces Cyclin D1 expression, allowing Cyclin D1 to complex with Cdk4 and Cdk6 and phosphorylate Rb. Rac-1 and PAK appear to induce Cyclin D1 expression and induce the G1 to S transition primarily through activation of NF-kB to activate the Cyclin D1 promoter. Rho activates cdk2 and also inhibits p21 and p27 to induce cyclin D1 and stimulate the G1 to S transition. Rho represses p21 expression to block p21 induction by Ras and to allow Ras induced progression",
  "p53 is a transcription factor who's activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The function is p53 is to keep the cell from progressing through the cell cycle if there is damage to DNA present. It may do this in multiple ways from holding the cell at a checkpoint until repairs can be made to causing the cell to enter apoptosis if the damage cannot be repaired. The critical role of p53 is evidenced by the fact that it is mutated in a very large fraction of tumors from nearly all sources.",
  "Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors involved in differentiation and survival of neural cells. The neurotrophin family consists of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4). Neurotrophins exert their functions through engagement of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors or p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Neurotrophin / Trk signaling is regulated by connecting a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, which include MAPK pathway, PI-3 kinase pathway, and PLC pathway, transmitting positive signals like enhanced survival and growth. On the other hand, p75NTR transmits both positive and nagative signals. These signals play an important role for neural development and additional higher-order activities such as learning and memory.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a14) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and / or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.",
  "TNF acts on several different signaling pathways through two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 to regulate apoptotic pathways, NF-kB activation of inflammation, and activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Interaction of TNFR1 with TRADD leads to activation of NF-kB and apoptosis pathways, while interaction with TRAF2 has generally been thought to be involved in stress kinase and NF-kB activation but is not required for TNF to induce apoptosis. Activation of NF-kB is mediated by TRAF2 through the NIK kinase and also by RIP but the observation that TNF activates NF-kB in mice lacking TRAF2 indicates that TRAF-2 does not play an essential role in this process. Stress-activated protein kinases, also called JNKs, are a family of map kinases activated by cellular stress and inflammatory signals. Binding of TNF to the TNFR1 receptor activates the germinal center kinase (GCK) through the TNF adaptor Traf2, activating the map kinase MEKK1. Both GCK and MEKK1 interact with Traf2, and GCK is required for MEKK1 activation by TNF, but GCK kinase activity does not appear to be required for MEKK1 activation. Instead, GCK activates",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a broad range of cellular and physiological responses. In addition to playing a role in inflammation and hematopoiesis, IL-6 is involved in other processes such as neuronal differentiation and bone loss. To produce these effects IL-6 signals through a receptor composed of two different subunits, an alpha subunit that produces ligand specificity and gp130, a receptor subunit shared in common with other cytokines in the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT3, that move into the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing STAT3 response elements. The ras-mediated pathway, acting through Shc, Grb-2 and Sos-1 upstream and activating Map kinases downstream, activates transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-IL-6 (C / EBP-beta) that can act through their own cognate response elements in the genome. These factors and other transcription factors like AP-1 and SRF (",

  "NK (natural killer) cells are lymphocytes distinct from B and T cells that induce perforin-mediated lysis of tumor cells and virus-infected cells. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is activated by glycoproteins on the cell surface (activating receptors) and inhibited by MHC-1 with self-peptide bound. The MHC-1 inhibitory signal through Ig-family or lectin receptors prevents NK cells from killing normal cells. Abnormal MHC-1 expression in infected or tumor cells results in the release of perforin, the lysis of the abnormal cell and the release of cytokines that stimulate the immune response. MAP kinase inhibitors but not ras inhibitors are able to block NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating that the pathway can function by a ras-independent manner that involves the MAP kinase pathway. This pathway includes phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) as a key component, followed by Rac1 and the exchange factor Vav. The tyrosine kinase SYK and LAT may provide an additional pathway for activation of MAP kinases leading to NK cell activation, and also Pyk-2 activation by integrins. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 appears to mediate the cytotoxicity inhibitory signal that blocks lysis",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. The GnRHR is coupled to Gq / 11 proteins to activate phospholipase C which transmits its signal to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates the intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and IP3 stimulates release of intracellular calcium. In addition to the classical Gq / 11, coupling of Gs is occasionally observed in a cell-specific fashion. Signaling downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Active MAPKs translocate to the nucleus, resulting in activation of transcription factors and rapid induction of early genes.",
  "Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor, which binds to a serum response element (SRE) associated with a variety of genes including (i) immediate early genes such as c-fos, fosB, junB, egr-1 and -2, (ii) neuronal genes such as nurr1 and nur77, and (iii) muscle genes such as actins and myosins. By regulating expression of these genes, SRF controls cell growth and differentiation, neuronal transmission as well as muscle development and function. SRF can be activated by serum, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), agents that increase intracellular Ca2 +, T-cell virus1 activator protein, hepatitis B virus activator proteins pX, activated oncogenes and protooncogenes and extracellular stimuli such as antioxidant and UV light.

  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",

  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein identified genetically as an important developmental factor. Shh provides a morphogenic signal in the developing CNS, organizing the spatial patterning of cells in the midbrain and inducing proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum, neural tube and retina. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Sonic hedgehog signaling may proceed by more than one mechanism. One signaling pathway is activated by Shh binding to Patched (Ptc-1) which releases inhibition of the GPCR Smoothened, activating the Shh signaling pathway and allowing progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Shh can also affect progression through the G2 / M transition. Patched binds to phosphorylated Cyclin B1, one component of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), along with the kinase Cdc2. The interaction of Cyclin B1 with Patched blocks MPF activity, blocking progression through the G2 / M transition. Shh binding leads to degradation of Ptc-1, release of Cyclin B1, and entry of the cyclin B1 into the nucleus. Pat",
  "Eenteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are closely related pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. The hallmark of EPEC / EHEC infections is induction of attaching and effacing (A / E) lesions that damage intestinal epithelial cells. The capacity to form A / E lesions is encoded mainly by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Tir, Map, EspF, EspG are known LEE-encoded effector proteins secreted via the type III secretion system, which is also LEE-encoded, into the host cell. EPEC and EHEC Tir's link the extracellular bacterium to the cell cytoskeleton. Map and EspF are involved in mitochondrion membrane permeabilization. EspG interacts with tubulins and stimulates microtubule destabilization. LEE-encoded adhesin or intimin (Eae) is exported via the general secretory pathway to the periplasm, where it is inserted into the outer membrane.

  "E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2 / cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2 / cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2 / cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S / G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical,",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mechanism to recognize and repair bulky DNA damage caused by compounds, environmental carcinogens, and exposure to UV-light. In humans hereditary defects in the NER pathway are linked to at least three diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The repair of damaged DNA involves at least 30 polypeptides within two different sub-pathways of NER known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR-NER) and global genome repair (GGR-NER). TCR refers to the expedited repair of lesions located in the actively transcribed strand of genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). In GGR-NER the first step of damage recognition involves XPC-hHR23B complex together with XPE complex (in prokaryotes, uvrAB complex). The following steps of GGR-NER and TCR-NER are similar.",
  "B cells must communicate with their environment to participate in the immune system as the source of antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation.

AKAP13 is a splice variant of the oncogene Lbc. Alternative splicing of the AKAP13 gene results in at least 3 transcript variants encoding different isoforms containing a Dbl oncogene homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain is associated with guanine nucleotide exchange activation for the Rho / Rac family of small GTP binding proteins, resulting in the conversion of the inactive GTPase to the active form capable of transducing signals. The PH domain has multiple functions. These splice variants contain a fragment that was originally identified as Ht31 which acts as a scaffolding protein to regulate the Rho signaling pathway and as protein kinase A-anchoring protein creating a coordination of these two signalling pathways. Diviani et al. found that in HEK293 cells LPA induced stimulation preferentially",
  "Nine currently identified phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-K) constitute a subfamily of lipid kinases that catalyze the addition of a phosphate molecule on the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), the precursor of all phosphoinosi-tides (PI), constitutes less than 10% of the total lipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. Approximately 5% of cellular PI is phosphorylated at the 4-position (PtdIns-4-P), and another 5% is phosphorylated at both the 4- and 5-positions (PtdIns-4,5-P2). However, less than 0.25% of the total inositol-containing lipids are phosphorylated at the 3-position, consistent with the idea that these lipids exert specific regulatory functions inside the cell, as opposed to a structural function. Here we have chosen to highlight a group of the phosphoinositide targets of the PI3-Ks and their downstream targets. The downstream effects of these PI-3 targets are indicated in the lower band illustrating the important role the PI3Ks have in cell function and survival.",
  "Glutamatergic-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production occurs via the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) -neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) ternary complex. The increased intracellular Ca2 + stimulates the interaction of nNOS and calmodulin (CaM) and the translocaton of nNOS from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The dephosphorylation of nNOS by Calcineurin catalyzes the conversion of arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), which turns on guanylate cyclase and the various cGMP regulated signaling pathways.",
  "Significant progress has been made towards delineation of the intrinsic molecular processes that regulate B lymphocyte immune function. Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of",
  "Inflammation is a complex response involving many different cells and signaling molecules, including the secretion of the cytokine IL-17 by activated T cells. IL-17 secretion is restricted to specific subsets of T cells but the receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed throughout the body, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders. Fibroblasts and other cells stimulated by IL-17 are induced themselves to secrete inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). These cytokines in turn provoke a range of activities, including the stimulation of neutrophil proliferation and differentiation.",
  "After transcription, eukaryotic mRNA precursors contain protein-coding exons and noncoding introns. In the following splicing, introns are excised and exons are joined by a macromolecular complex, the spliceosome. The standard spliceosome is made up of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, and several spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs). Spliceosomes are not a simple stable complex, but a dynamic family of particles that assemble on the mRNA precursor and help fold it into a conformation that allows transesterification to proceed. Various spliceosome forms (e.g. A-, B- and C-complexes) have been identified.",
  "A complex network of interacting proteins and enzymes is required for DNA replication. Generally, DNA replication follows a multistep enzymatic pathway. At the DNA replication fork, a DNA helicase (DnaB or MCM complex) precedes the DNA synthetic machinery and unwinds the duplex parental DNA in cooperation with the SSB or RPA. On the leading strand, replication occurs continuously in a 5 to 3 direction, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA replication occurs discontinuously by synthesis and joining of short Okazaki fragments. In prokaryotes, the leading strand replication apparatus consists of a DNA polymerase (pol III core), a sliding clamp (beta), and a clamp loader (gamma delta complex). The DNA primase (DnaG) is needed to form RNA primers. Normally, during replication of the lagging-strand DNA template, an RNA primer is removed either by an RNase H or by the 5 to 3 exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments. In eukaryotes, three DNA polymerases (alpha, delta, and epsilon) have been identified. DNA primase forms a permanent complex with DNA polymerase alpha.",
  "Myocardial infraction (MI) is the condition of irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle that results from prolonged ischemia. Nearly 1.5 million people in US sustain an MI each year, and this event proves fatal in approximately one third of patients. Approximately 90% of MI result from formation of an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The thrombus transforms a region of plaque narrowing to one of complete vessel occlusion (top right in pink). The responsible thrombus appears to be generated by interactions between the atherosclerotic plaque, the coronary endothelium, circulating platelets, and dynamic vasomotor tone of the vessel wall, all of which overwhelm natural protective mechanisms. The endogenous protective mechanisms against thrombosis include: 1. Inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III (ATIII), the effectiveness of which is enhanced by binding of ATIII to heparin sulafate. The antithrombin binding region of commercial heparin consists of sulfated disaccharide units (bottom panel). 2. Inactivation of clotting factors Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (protein C *), an action that is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombomodulin (TM)",
  "Thrombin is an extracellular protease that is involved in the clotting of blood and inflammation through its action on platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature and that plays a role in thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4. PAR1 activation may be involved in the dilation of arteries during inflammation through the action of thrombin on endothelial cells and in platelet activation by thrombin during clotting. PAR1 and PAR2 activation cause bronchodilation in airway and may protect against",
  "The CD40 receptor was first associated with expression in B cells and the role it plays through its ligand CD40L (CD154) in moderating T cell activation. Broader expression may indicate a broader role for CD40 and CD40L in immune function and disease states such as transplant rejection and HIV infection. Disruption of CD40 interaction with CD40L may prove therapeutic in the treatment of autoimmune disorders or heart disease and modulation of the interaction may in the future be exploited in cancer treatment. As a member of the TNF receptor family, CD40 relies on interaction with TRAF proteins to mediate an intracellular signal in response to CD40L binding. The pathway downstream of TRAFs activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through a kinase pathway involving map kinases, NIK (NF-kappaB inducing kinase) and I-kappa B kinases. Some CD40 responses like regulation of immunoglobulin expression might be mediated by NF-kappaB transcriptional activation.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.",
  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. During an inflammation or immune reaction, specialized leukocytes (eosinophilic granulocytes) adhere to and pass through the endothelium of the blood vessels and the underlying matrix. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flattening of the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or even through the intercellular matrix. This is mediated by a homophilic interactions of PECAM and CD31.",
  "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was first identified by virtue of the essential role it plays in collagen modification, preventing the nutritional deficiency scurvy. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for hydroxylase enzymes that post-translationally modify collagen to increase the strength and elasticity of tissues. Vitamin C reduces the metal ion prosthetic groups of many enzymes, maintaining activity of enzymes, also acts as an anti-oxidant. Although the prevention of scurvy through modification of collagen may be the most obvious role for vitamin C, it is not necessarily the only role of vitamin C. Svct1 and Svct2 are ascorbate transporters for vitamin C import into tissues and into cells. Both of these transporters specifically transport reduced L-ascorbic acid against a concentration gradient using the intracellular sodium gradient to drive ascorbate transport. Svct1 is expressed in epithelial cells in the intestine, upregulated in cellular models for intestinal epithelium and appears to be responsible for the import of dietary vitamin C from the intestinal lumen. The vitamin C imported from the intestine is present in plasma at approximately 50 uM, almost exclusively in the reduced form, and is transported to tissues to play",
  "Approximately 30% of breast carcinomas lack ER expression. Presumably, these breast cancers become estrogen independent through genetic alterations that bypass the requirement for ER-dependent stimulation of cell proliferation. As such estrogen receptor is a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelia and represents a crucial prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression through direct gene activation of a number of genes (cathepsin D, HSP27 (heat shock protein 27,000 kDa, aldolase A, dehydrogenase, alpha-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphat, Pdzk1, Greb ets) and also through the biological functions of target loci. The product of human MTA3 has been identified as an estrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2 / NuRD transcriptional corepressor in breast epithelial cells and demonstrate that MTA3 constitutes a key component of an estrogen-dependent pathway regulating growth and differentiation. The absence of estrogen receptor or of MTA3 leads to aberrant expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Aberrant Snail expression results in loss of expression of the",
  "Proposed model for b2-AR- and prostanoid-receptor-mediated PLC and calcium signalling. Receptors coupling to Gs stimulate AC, resulting in elevated cAMP levels and activation of Epac1. Epac1 then catalyses GTP-loading on Rap2B, which leads to PLC-e activation. The proposed pathway may involve additional signalling components to attain PLC stimulation. The action of cAMP seems to be independent of PKA; Instead, the cAMP-activated Rap-GEF Epac seems to serve as a cAMP effector, inducing GTP loading and, hence, activation of Rap2B, which then leads to specific activation of PLC-e, which has been shown to interact with Rap GTPases. It is an attractive hypothesis, therefore, that the Rap-dependent PLC and calcium signalling pathway reported here is not restricted to Gs-and AC-coupled receptors, such as the b2-AR and the prostanoid receptor, but could be used by other receptors as well.",
  "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage biological macromolecules and are detrimental to cellular health. Electrophilic compounds, xenobiotics and antioxidants are sources of reactive oxygen species, creating oxidative stress that can harm cells. Enzymes are involved in the Phase II detoxification of xenobiotics to reduce cellular stress include glutathione transferases, quinone reductase, epoxide hydrolase, heme oxygenase, UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Expression of these genes protects cells from oxidative damage and can prevent mutagenesis and cancer. Transcription of these enzymes is coordinately regulated through antioxidant response elements (AREs). Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) and Nrf1 are transcription factors that bind to AREs and activate these genes. Inactive Nrf2 is retained in the cytosol by association a complex with the cytoskeletal protein Keap1. Cytosolic Nrf2 is phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to protein kinase C activation and Map kinase pathways. In the nucleus, Nrf2 activate genes through AREs by interacting with transcription factors in the bZIP family, including CREB, ATF4 and fos or jun. Nrf2 activation of genes is opposed by small maf proteins, including MafG and MafK,",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting viral pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Non-self RNA appearing in a cell as a result of intracellular viral replication is recognized by a family of cytosolic RNA helicases termed RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). The RLR proteins include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 and are expressed in both immune and nonimmune cells. Upon recognition of viral nucleic acids, RLRs recruit specific intracellular adaptor proteins to initiate signaling pathways that lead to the synthesis of type I interferon and other inflammatory cytokines, which are important for eliminating viruses.",
  "The insulin resistance of type II diabetes appears to be caused in part by the presence of high levels of lipids in cells such as skeletal muscle where this would not normally be found. The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import",
  "Sodium transport across the tight epithelia of Na + reabsorbing tissues such as the distal part of the kidney nephron and colon is the major factor determining total-body Na + levels, and thus, long-term blood pressure. Aldosterone plays a major role in sodium and potassium metabolism by binding to epithelial mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the renal collecting duct cells localized in the distal nephron, promoting sodium resorption and potassium excretion. Aldosterone enters a target cell and binds MR, which translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. Activation of MR leads to increased expression of Sgk-1, which phosphorylates Nedd4-2, an ubiquitin-ligase which targets ENAC to proteosomal degradation. Phosphorylated Nedd4-2 dissociates from ENAC, increasing its apical membrane abundance. Activation of MR also leads to increased expression of Na + / K + -ATPase, thus causing a net increase in sodium uptake from the renal filtrate. The specificity of MR for aldosterone is provided by 11beta-HSD2 by the rapid conversion of cortisol to cortisone in renal cortical collecting duct cells. Recently, besides genomic effects mediated by activated MR, rapid aldosterone actions",
  "Activation of T lymphocytes is a key event for an efficient response of the immune system. It requires the involvement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD28. Engagement of these receptors through the interaction with a foreign antigen associated with major histocompatibility complex molecules and CD28 counter-receptors B7.1 / B7.2, respectively, results in a series of signaling cascades. These cascades comprise an array of protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, GTP-binding proteins and adaptor proteins that regulate generic and specialised functions, leading to T-cell proliferation, cytokine production and differentiation into effector cells.",

  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc-gamma-R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.",
  "Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in",
  "Physical interactions between intergrin alpha4beta1 heterodimer expressed on B cells and counter receptors on stroma cells are key mediators of the survival of normal and malignant B cells. Recent data indicate that integrin stimulation increases FBI-1, XIAP, surviving, and CCT4 expression but inhibits Requiem, c-Fos, and caspase 3 and 7 induction.",

  "p53 is a transcription factor who's activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The function is p53 is to keep the cell from progressing through the cell cycle if there is damage to DNA present. It may do this in multiple ways from holding the cell at a checkpoint until repairs can be made to causing the cell to enter apoptosis if the damage cannot be repaired. The critical role of p53 is evidenced by the fact that it is mutated in a very large fraction of tumors from nearly all sources.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR has three subtypes (PPARalpha, beta / delta, and gamma) showing different expression patterns in vertebrates. Each of them is encoded in a separate gene and binds fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPARalpha plays a role in the clearance of circulating or cellular lipids via the regulation of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. PPARbeta / delta is involved in lipid oxidation and cell proliferation. PPARgamma promotes adipocyte differentiation to enhance blood glucose uptake.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, which include TGF-betas, activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are structurally related secreted cytokines found in species ranging from worms and insects to mammals. A wide spectrum of cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration are regulated by TGF-beta family members. TGF-beta family member binds to the Type II receptor and recruits Type I, whereby Type II receptor phosphorylates and activates Type I. The Type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads: Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8). Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and the heteromeric complex then translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Smad complexes activate specific genes through cooperative interactions with other DNA-binding and coactivator (or co-repressor) proteins.",
  "The body gets energy through the oxidation of food such as glucose and fatty acids. The chemical energy contained in these foods is extracted and converted until it reaches a common form, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable and is coupled to a variety of energetically unfavorable processes to drive them forward. How is the energy of glucose captured and converted to make ATP? Most of the energy of glucose or fatty acids is extracted through oxidation to produce the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. From there, the energy is transferred next to the electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chain includes a series of protein complexes and non-membrane cofactors that transfer the electrons from NADH and FADH2 in a series of redox reactions from carrier to carrier. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the chain, resulting in the production of water. The oxygen we breath, and which is transported by hemoglobin in the blood to all of the tissues, serves this purpose and allows electron transport to occur. As the electrons pass through the chain, they transfer their energy to",
  "TNFR2 is the receptor for the 171 amino acid 19 kD TNF (beta) (a.k.a. lymphotoxin). TNF (beta) is produced by activated lymphocytes and can be cytotoxic to many tumor and other cells. In neutrophils, endothelial cells and osteoclasts TNF (beta) can lead to activation while in many other cell types it can lead to increased expression of MHC and adhesion molecules.",
  "Skeletal muscle atrophies with disuse while with increased use and increased load skeletal muscle exhibits hypertrophy, with an increase in the size of existing muscle fibers. One signaling pathway involved in regulating skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy is the AKT / mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway activity increases in response to muscle activity during hypertrophy and decreases in activity during atrophy. Blocking this pathway genetically or with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks hypertrophy and genetic activation of the pathway induces hypertrophy. One agent that promotes muscle hypertrophy is the growth factor IGF-1. IGF-1 activates AKT, GSK-3beta and mTOR to promote hypertrophy. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway is not involved in hypertrophy and is down-regulated by agents such as IGF-1 that promote hypertrophy. Calcineurin may modulate other aspects of muscle function such as the development of slow muscle fibers through transcriptional regulation. These pathways lead to regulation of protein translation, with increased translation apparently acting as a key regulatory point in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Agents such as IGF-1 that stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy may provide treatments for muscle atrophy and wasting.",
  "Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2 / neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) show elevated expression of EGF receptors (e.g. HER2 / neu) and their ligands (e.g.TGF-alpha) consistent with the presence of this autocrine loop. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.",

  "Heart formation is cued by a combination of positive and negative signals from surrounding tissues. Inhibitory signals that block heart formation in anterior paraxial mesoderm include Wnt family members expressed in dorsal neural tube and anti-BMPs expressed in the axial tissues (i.e., noggin in the notochord). Wnt signalling pathway, which is essential for setting up the entire body pattern during embryonic development involves glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3 is active and phosphorylates b-catenin resulting in its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits GSK3, thereby preventing phosphorylation of b-catenin, which is then able to move to the nucleus. There it associates with members of the LEF-1 / TCF family of transcription factors, which activate the transcription of genes like cyclin-D1, myc, and MMPs. The Wnt signaling pathway is blocked by a family of secreted proteins such as crescent and Dkk-1 sufficient for induction of heart formation in posterior mesoderm. BMP signaling can also be blocked by the BMP antagonists noggin and chordin, which are secreted from the notochord and cooperate",
  "The scanning translation initiation model suggests that 40S ribosomal subunit preloaded with factors bind to the 5 end of the mRNA near the cap.

Translation control is mostly regulated at the protein initiation step through translation initiation factors such as eIF2 or eIF4.",
  "HIV infection is associated with immunosuppression caused by a dramatic reduction in the helper T cell population. The loss of helper T cells may be caused by HIV-induced apoptosis of both infected and uninfected helper T cells. HIV uses the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor for macrophage cell entry and upregulates fas-ligand on these cells. CD4 on helper T cells is essential for viral cell entry and infection. Cross-linking of CD4 on the T cell surface may be involved in upregulation of Fas and sensitization of T cells to apoptosis induced by the Fas / Fas-ligand interaction.",
  "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has affected thousands of individuals, causing fever, and pneumonia with a mortality rate estimated at 10-18%. A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause agent and its genome has been sequenced. Human coronaviruses cause mild respiratory illness and accounts for about a third of all cases of the common cold. The enveloped SARS virus contains a large + strand RNA genome, approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Examination of the SARS coronavirus sequences reveals that rep gene covers over 20,000 nucleotides and encodes two overlapping polyproteins cleaved by viral proteases into smaller protein products. Translation of the longer polyprotein encoded by the rep gene requires a ribosomal frameshift. Other viral genes are predicted to encode the transmembrane spike protein S involved in viral fusion with host cells, the envelope protein E, the membrane protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N that binds to the RNA genome as well as several additional open reading frames with unknown functions. Viral entry into the cell is followed by translation of the viral rep gene, which codes for a viral protease within the polyprotein, Mpro or 3CL",
  "Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells",
  "Leukocyte migaration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation. During this diapedesis of leukocytes, the leukocytes bind to endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM) and then migrate across the vascular endothelium. A leukocyte adherent to CAMs on the endothelial cells moves forward by leading-edge protrusion and retraction of its tail. In this process, alphaL / beta2 integrin activates through Vav1, RhoA, which subsequently activates the kinase p160ROCK. ROCK activation leads to MLC phosphorylation, resulting in retraction of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Leukocytes activate endothelial cell signals that stimulate endothelial cell retraction during localized dissociation of the endothelial cell junctions. ICAM-1-mediated signals activate an endothelial cell calcium flux and PKC, which are required for ICAM-1 dependent leukocyte migration. VCAM-1 is involved in the opening of the endothelial passage through which leukocytes can extravasate. In this regard, VCAM-1 ligation induces NADPH oxidase activation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a Rac-mediated manner, with subsequent activation of matrix metallopoteinases and loss of VE-cadherin-mediated",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mechanism to recognize and repair bulky DNA damage caused by compounds, environmental carcinogens, and exposure to UV-light. In humans hereditary defects in the NER pathway are linked to at least three diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The repair of damaged DNA involves at least 30 polypeptides within two different sub-pathways of NER known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR-NER) and global genome repair (GGR-NER). TCR refers to the expedited repair of lesions located in the actively transcribed strand of genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). In GGR-NER the first step of damage recognition involves XPC-hHR23B complex together with XPE complex (in prokaryotes, uvrAB complex). The following steps of GGR-NER and TCR-NER are similar.",

  "Activation of T lymphocytes is a key event for an efficient response of the immune system. It requires the involvement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD28. Engagement of these receptors through the interaction with a foreign antigen associated with major histocompatibility complex molecules and CD28 counter-receptors B7.1 / B7.2, respectively, results in a series of signaling cascades. These cascades comprise an array of protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, GTP-binding proteins and adaptor proteins that regulate generic and specialised functions, leading to T-cell proliferation, cytokine production and differentiation into effector cells.",
  "mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appears to play a central role in signaling caused by nutrients and mitogens such as growth factors to regulate translation. The drug rapamycin acts on mammalian cells through the mTOR protein kinase, also known as FRAP. When bound to the immunophilin binding protein FKBP12, rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity and has immunosuppressant activity. Rapamycin and the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 are being tested as anti-cancer agents, acting to block mitogenic signaling. Recently, mTOR was also found to act as an ATP sensor to regulate cell growth. Upstream activation of PI 3 kinase activity that leads to oncogenic transformation can be blocked by inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. Growth factor receptors first stimulate PI 3 kinase, and through inositol phosphates activate PDK-1 and AKT (protein kinase B). AKT phosphorylates mTOR. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP by mTOR and the phosphorylation downstream of RPS6 and EIF-4B stimulate translational initiation and contribute to cell growth.",
  "Myocardial infarction damages heart tissue both during the initial ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion of tissues with oxygen. Corticosteroids can protect cardiac tissue from damage following a heart attack, but the mechanisms by which corticosteroids are cardioprotective have not been clear and negative side effects such as reduced wound healing may result from their use. Corticosteroids exert a variety of actions through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. GR acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, but some of the cardioprotective effects mediated by GR-bound corticosteroids are non-transcriptional in nature. Glucocorticoids are commonly used as anti-inflammatory drugs in a variety of conditions, and some of their effects in the heart result from inhibition of the inflammatory response of heart tissue to ischemia and reperfusion. NF-kB is a transcription factor involved in signaling by inflammatory factors such as TNF, and is repressed by glucocorticoids. Annexin-1 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein whose expression is induced by corticosteroids and inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into tissue, blocking reperfusion-induced inflammatory heart damage. A non-transcriptional cardioprotective effect of glucocorticoids is activation of",
  "Cholera toxin (CTX) is one of the main virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae. Once secreted, CTX B-chain (CTXB) binds to ganglioside GM1 on the surface of the host's cells. After binding takes place, the entire CTX complex is carried from plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the A-chain (CTXA) is recognized by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), unfolded, and delivered to the membrane where the membrane-associated ER-oxidase, Ero1, oxidizes PDI to release the CTXA into the protein-conducting channel, Sec61. CTXA is then retro-translocated to the cytosol and induces water and electrolyte secretion by increasing cAMP levels via adenylate cyclase (AC) to exert toxicity. Other than CTX, Vibrio cholerae generates several toxins that are perilous to eukaryotic cells. Zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) causes tight junction disruption through protein kinase C-dependent actin polymerization. RTX toxin (RtxA) causes actin depolymerization by covalently cross-linking actin monomers into dimers, trimers, and higher multimers. Vibrio",
  "Neutrophils respond to bacterial infection by releasing reactive oxygen species that kill bacteria and by expressing chemokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection. The multisubunit enzyme NADPH oxidase expressed by neutrophils produces reactive oxygen species rapidly released in what is known as the respiratory burst. Activity of the NADPH oxidase is induced by fMLP receptor ligands, formylated peptides from bacteria. The fMLP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, FPR-1, that activates Map kinase pathways and phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation releases IP3 and calcium, activating protein kinase C and also activating the transcription factor NFAT, which contributes to activation of chemokine genes. One of the components of the NADPH oxidase is p47phox. PKC activation phosphorylates p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase activity. Activation of Map kinase cascades leads to Erk1 / Erk2 dependent p47phox phosphorylation as well as activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and chemokine gene expression. Inhibition of p38 did not affect p47phox phosphorylation, indicating that p38 is not involved in Erk1 / 2 activation of the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of p38 did inhibit",
  "Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage.",
  "The correct processing, quality control and turnover of cellular RNA molecules are critical to many aspects in the expression of genetic information. In eukaryotes, two major pathways of mRNA decay exist and both pathways are initiated by poly (A) shortening of the mRNA. In the 5 'to 3' pathway, this is followed by decapping which then permits the 5 'to 3' exonucleolytic degradation of transcripts. In the 3 'to 5' pathway, the exosome, a large multisubunit complex, plays a key role. The exosome exists in archaeal cells, too. In bacteria, endoribonuclease E, a key enzyme involved in RNA decay and processing, organizes a protein complex called degradosome. RNase E or R interacts with the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, DEAD-box helicases, and additional factors in the RNA-degrading complex.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a14) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and / or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.",
  "O-glycans are a class of glycans that modify serine or threonine residues of proteins. Biosynthesis of O-glycans starts from the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine. The first GalNAc may be extended with sugars including galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, or sialic acid, but not mannose, glucose, or xylose. Depending on the sugars added, there are four common O-glycan core structures, cores 1 through 4, and an additional four, cores 5 though 8. Mucins are highly O-glycosylated glycoproteins ubiquitous in mucous secretions on cell surfaces and in body fluids. Mucin O-glycans can be branched, and many sugars or groups of sugars are antigenic. Important modifications of mucin O-glycans include O-acetylation of sialic acid and O-sulfation of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine.",
  "During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation, called meiosis I and meiosis II. At meiosis I, homologous chromosomes recombine and then segregate to opposite poles, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In vertebrates, immature oocytes are arrested at the PI (prophase of meiosis I). The resumption of meiosis is stimulated by progesterone, which carries the oocyte through two consecutive M-phases (MI and MII) to a second arrest at MII. The key activity driving meiotic progression is the MPF (maturation-promoting factor), a heterodimer of CDC2 (cell division cycle 2 kinase) and cyclin B. In PI-arrested oocytes, MPF is initially inactive and is activated by the dual-specificity CDC25C phosphatase as the result of new synthesis of Mos induced by progesterone. MPF activation mediates the transition from the PI arrest to MI. The subsequent decrease in MPF levels, required to exit from MI into interkinesis, is induced by a negative feedback loop, where CDC2 brings about the activation of the APC (anaphase-promoting complex), which mediates",
  "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals primarily through the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). The activities of IL-1 include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and roles in arthritis and septic shock. The inflammatory activities of IL-1 are partially derived by transcriptionally inducing expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interferons, as well as inducing the expression of other inflammation-related genes. There are two forms of IL-1 encoded by distinct genes, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta is produced as a 269 amino acid precursor that is cleaved by IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) to the active IL-1 beta form that is secreted. IL-1 signaling is opposed by the naturally occurring peptide IL-1 receptor antagonist which is a therapeutic agent for the treatment of arthritis. The type 1 IL-1 receptor protein binds IL-1 beta but requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to transduce a signal. IL-1 binding",
  "IL-22 is an inflammatory cytokine related to IL-10 that is produced by T cells and that induces a response in cells through a heterodimeric cell surface receptor composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2C. One of the actions of IL-22 appears to be the induction of the acute phase inflammatory response in hetapocytes, acting through activation of STATs and transcriptional regulation. A gene with homology to the extracellular domain of the cell surface IL-22R1 receptor component was identified that lacked transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The protein derived from this gene was found to bind IL-22 and block its interaction with the cell surface receptor. The IL-22 soluble receptor (IL-22BP, IL-22 binding protein) also blocks some of the downstream effects of IL-22 such as STAT activation and the transcriptional induction of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. The IL-22 soluble receptor may act as an anti-inflammatory agent.",
  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs coincides with the recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases, including c-Src, Hck and c-Fgr (Src-TK), to the receptor-arrestin complex. Several signaling events have been reported to involve -arrestin-dependent Src recruitment. These include the regulation of clathrin-dependent 2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis by tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, Ras-dependent activation of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade and stimulation of cell proliferation by 2-adrenergic and neurokinin NK1 receptors, and stimulation of chemokine CXCR1 receptor-mediated neutrophil degranulation",
  "Several forms of post-translational modification regulate protein activities. Recently, protein methylation by CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) has been observed to play a key role in transcriptional regulation. CARM1 associates with the p160 class of transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by steroid hormone family receptors. CARM1 also interacts with CBP / p300 transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by a large variety of transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors and CEBP. One target of CARM1 is the core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets of the histone acetylase activity of CBP / p300 coactivators. Recruitment of CARM1 to the promoter region by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and makes promoter regions more accessible for transcription. Another target of CARM1 methylation is a coactivator it interacts with, CBP. Methylation of CBP by CARM1 blocks CBP from acting as a coactivator for CREB and redirects the limited CBP pool in the cell to be available for steroid hormone receptors. Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known. The methylation activity",
  "Lipopolysaccharide. One of the key actions of AKT is to block apoptosis. AKT phosphorylation of NF-kB promotes the survival and activation of macrophages responding to LPS. Another substrate of AKT is the protein kinase Gsk3-beta. AKT phosphorylates and deactivates Gsk3-beta. Non-phosphorylated Gsk3-beta is active and phosphorylates beta-catenin, leading to its degradation in the ubiquitin dependent proteosome pathway. Stimulation by LPS causes the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus and the activation of genes in concert with the transcription factor LEF1. This pathway is probably not restricted to alveolar pathway, but leads to the activation of beta-catenin dependent genes by LPS in other cells as well. Other pathways regulate this pathway also, such as the modulation of PI3 kinase activity by ceramide, and the inhibition of Gsk3-beta activity by the Wnt / frizzled / disheveled (DSH) pathway.",
  "Five distinct stages have been proposed in the evolution of melanoma on the basis of histological criteria: common acquired and congenital nevi without dysplastic changes; dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia; radial-growth phase (RGP) melanoma; vertical-growth phase (VGP) melanoma; and metastatic melanoma. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Moreover, melanoma development is strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways. The vertical-growth phase and metastatic melanoma are notable for striking changes in the control of cell adhesion. Recently, amplification of the MITF gene was demonstrated in 10% of primary melanomas and 20% of metastatic melanomas, suggesting that MITF is a melanoma oncogene.",
  "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has affected thousands of individuals, causing fever, and pneumonia with a mortality rate estimated at 10-18%. A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause agent and its genome has been sequenced. Human coronaviruses cause mild respiratory illness and accounts for about a third of all cases of the common cold. The enveloped SARS virus contains a large + strand RNA genome, approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Examination of the SARS coronavirus sequences reveals that rep gene covers over 20,000 nucleotides and encodes two overlapping polyproteins cleaved by viral proteases into smaller protein products. Translation of the longer polyprotein encoded by the rep gene requires a ribosomal frameshift. Other viral genes are predicted to encode the transmembrane spike protein S involved in viral fusion with host cells, the envelope protein E, the membrane protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N that binds to the RNA genome as well as several additional open reading frames with unknown functions. Viral entry into the cell is followed by translation of the viral rep gene, which codes for a viral protease within the polyprotein, Mpro or 3CL",
  "The cell cycle is regulated by the interplay of many molecules. Key among these are the cyclins which are expressed and then degraded in a concerted fashion to drive the stages of the cell cycle. Cyclins combine with cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) to form activated kinases that phosphorylate targets leading to cell cycle regulation. A breakdown in the regulation of this cycle can lead to out of control growth and contribute to tumor formation. Defects in many of the molecules that regulate the cell cycle have been implicated in cancer. Key among these are p53, the cdk inhibitors (p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27), and Rb, all of which act to keep the cell cycle from progressing until all repairs to damaged DNA have been completed.",

The IL-22 soluble receptor may act as an anti-inflammatory agent.",
  "Oxidative stress is one factor that can trigger programmed cell death. Activated neutrophils responding to inflammatory stimulation produce reactive oxygen species like superoxide free radicals to kill invading bacteria, but these reactive oxygen species can also attack endothelial cells lining the vascular wall and trigger apoptosis. Endothelial cells also produce reactive oxygen species inside the cell that can contribute to oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as during reperfusion injury following ischemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts highly reactive and damaging superoxide free radicals to peroxides that are less reactive than superoxide but stimulate apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) peptide reducing agent removes toxic metabolites and repairs damage created by reactive oxygen species. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), for example, removes peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent, and glutathione reductase (GSR) regenerates reduced glutathione. Inside the endothelial cell peroxide can be converted to hydroxyl ions in the presence of iron. Peroxides and hydroxyl radicals activate NF-kB and activate expression of inflammatory genes including adhesion molecules, TNF and IL-8. The apoptotic response of endothelial cells to oxidative stress may be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",
  "Role of -arrestins in the desensitization, sequestration and intracellular trafficking of GPCRs. Homologous desensitization of GPCRs (1) results from the binding of -arrestins (-arr) to agonist -occupied receptors following phosphorylation of the receptor by GRKs. -arrestin binding sterically precludes coupling between the receptor and heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to termination of signaling by G proteins effectors. Receptor-bound -arrestins also act as adapter proteins, binding to components of the clathrin endocytic machinery including clathrin, 2-adaptin (AP-2). Receptor sequestration (2) reflects the dynamin (Dyn) -dependent endocytosis of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits. Once internalized, GPCRs exhibit two distinct patterns of -arrestin interaction. `Class A 'GPCRs, for example the 2 adrenergic receptor, rapidly dissociate from -arrestin upon internalization. These receptors are trafficked to an acidified endosomal compartment, wherein the ligand is dissociated and the receptor dephosphorylated by a GPCR-specific protein phosphatase PP2A isoform, and are subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane (3). `Class B' receptors, for example the angiotensin II AT1a receptor, form stable receptor--arrestin",
  "The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family transduces extracellular signals across the plasma membrane, activating cellular responses through a variety of second messenger cascades. These receptors provide rapid responses to a variety of stimuli, and are often rapidly attenuated in their signaling. Failure to attenuate GPCR signaling can have dramatic consequences. One method to attenuate GPCR signaling is by removal of the stimulus from the extracellular fluid. At the synapse, removal of neurotransmitter or peptide signaling molecules is accomplished by either reuptake or degradation. Acetylcholine is removed from synapses through degradation by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase results in prolonged signaling at the neuromuscular junction, and uncontrollable spasms in humans caused by nerve gas or in insects by some insecticides. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is also used therapeutically to treat Alzheimer's disease, compensating for the loss of cholinergic neurons. Transporters for serotonin, dopamine, GABA and noradrenaline remove these neurotransmitters from the synapse to terminate signaling. Antidepressants such as Prozac inhibit reuptake of serotonin and many drugs of abuse such as cocaine act by blocking reuptake of dopamine or adrenaline. Reuptake not only terminates signaling, but can also conserve neurotransmitter through recycling",
  "N-glycans or asparagine-linked glycans are major constituents of glycoproteins in eukaryotes. N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser / Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases, the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of human diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation.",
  "The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Normally, ligand-dependent signaling by Hedgehog (Hh) homologs proceeds through binding to the Patched receptor. This binding relieves the Patched-mediated inhibition of signaling through the Smoothened (SMOH) gene product. This signaling ultimately results in the dissociation of the Gli1 transcription factor from an inhibitory complex in the cytoplasm, its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, and activation of target gene expression. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (> 50%) in sporadic BCC.",
  "Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells",
  "CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor in the GPCR gene family, and is expressed by cells in the immune system and the central nervous system. In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role",
  "Cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs), the most common type of intercellular adhesions, are important for maintaining tissue architecture and cell polarity and can limit cell movement and proliferation. At AJs, E-cadherin serves as an essential cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cytoplasmic tail binds beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is associated with F-actin bundles directly and indirectly. The integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of beta-catenin by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Fer, Fyn, Yes, and Src), which leads to dissociation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Integrity of this complex is positively regulated by beta -catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase II, and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Changes in the phosphorylation state of beta-catenin affect cell-cell adhesion, cell migration and the level of signaling beta-catenin. Wnt signaling acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin by inhibiting beta-catenin degradation, which stabilizes beta-catenin, and causes its accumulation. Cadherin may acts as a negative regulator",
  "The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in macrophages are activated by their peptide ligands and also by the HIV envelope protein GP120 during HIV infection. One mechanism of signaling by these GPCRs is through activation of Gi signaling. These chemokine receptors can also signal through a Gi-independent pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. This pathway elevates calcium influx into the cell through CRAC channels, ion channels that are activated by calcium release. Elevated calcium from CRAC is required for downstream activation of Pyk2, a focal adhesion-associated protein kinase. Non Gi signaling by these chemokine receptors also involves the Jnk and p38 Map kinase pathways leading to AP-1 activation and activation of genes such as MIP-1 and MCP-1. This pathway may be involved in the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of AIDS.",
  "TNF acts on several different signaling pathways through two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 to regulate apoptotic pathways, NF-kB activation of inflammation, and activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Interaction of TNFR1 with TRADD leads to activation of NF-kB and apoptosis pathways, while interaction with TRAF2 has generally been thought to be involved in stress kinase and NF-kB activation but is not required for TNF to induce apoptosis. Activation of NF-kB is mediated by TRAF2 through the NIK kinase and also by RIP but the observation that TNF activates NF-kB in mice lacking TRAF2 indicates that TRAF-2 does not play an essential role in this process. Stress-activated protein kinases, also called JNKs, are a family of map kinases activated by cellular stress and inflammatory signals. Binding of TNF to the TNFR1 receptor activates the germinal center kinase (GCK) through the TNF adaptor Traf2, activating the map kinase MEKK1. Both GCK and MEKK1 interact with Traf2, and GCK is required for MEKK1 activation by TNF, but GCK kinase activity does not appear to be required for MEKK1 activation. Instead, GCK activates",
  "The complement cascade of proteolytic factors involved in cellular lysis can be initiated by several different factors, including antibody-dependent and antibody-independent recognition of infectious organisms. In the lectin-induced complement cascade, carbohydrates on the surface of microbial cells activate the complement cascade by binding to mannan-binding lectin (also called the mannan-binding protein, Mbl / Mbp). Mbp is an acute phase serum protein whose expression is induced by microbial infection. The binding of Mbl to microbial ligands activates the Mbl associated serine proteases Masp1 and Masp2, triggering the cleavage of C2 and C4 to create C4bC2a, a C3 convertase that cleaves large numbers of C3. Masp1 and Masp2 are similar to the C1 protease in the classical complement pathway. Once formed the C3 convertase cleaves and activates the remaining complement factors leading ultimately to formation of a pore in the bacterial membrane by the membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses the bacterial cell. The lectin-induced pathway also appears to play an important role of the activation of phagocytotic cells by infection. Although the initiating event activating the",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.",
  "The chromatin packaging of the genome is dynamic, changing with the cell cycle and with transcriptional regulation. During mitosis, chromatin is condensed for segregation of chromosomes, while for transcription chromatin is more open. The nuclear matrix, or scaffold, is a protein network in the nucleus providing structure and regulating chromatin condensation. Regulated interactions of matrix proteins with each other, DNA and other factors in different phases of the cell cycle alter the structure and function of chromatin. AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein) is a nuclear matrix associated protein that also binds DNA and different proteins during different phases of the cell cycle. The interaction of AKAP95 with DNA and proteins alters the condensation and transcription of chromatin. A specific domain of AKAP95 regulates its interaction with the nuclear matrix and another regulates its association with DNA. One key protein that AKAP95 interacts with is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. AKAP95 binds to PKA through a PKA RII regulatory subunit, an interaction that requires PKA phosphorylation by Cdk1. PKA activity and cAMP are reduced during entry into mitosis, but PKA recruited by AKAP",
  "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) eliminates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by direct ligation. NHEJ involves binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs (MRX complex in yeast), processing of ends, and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV (LIG4) -XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation. A recent study shows that bacteria accomplish NHEJ using just two proteins (Ku and DNA ligase), whereas eukaryotes require many factors. NHEJ repairs DSBs at all stages of the cell cycle, bringing about the ligation of two DNA DSBs without the need for sequence homology, and so is error-prone.",
  "The heparan sulphate proteoglycan agrin is well known as the key assembly factor of postsynaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), but recent data suggest it also plays a direct role in the organization of the cytoskeleton in the skeletal muscle. Signaling through muscle-specific proteins such as muscle specific kinase (MuSK) and or acetylcholine receptor (AchRs) / rapsyn, agrin can activate ubiquitously expressed Rac, Cdc42, and p21-activated kinase (PAK) that are involved in actin polymerization. Agrin also engages signaling pathways of several potent oncogenes (i.e., SFK, ErbB receptors, and cortactin).",
  "The function of hemoglobin in oxygen transport by red blood cells requires precise assembly of a tetramer of two beta-subunits and two alpha-units. If too many beta-subunits are present, then all tetramers of beta-subunits are formed that bind oxygen but do not release it when needed. When alpha-subunits are in excess they form precipitates with oxidized heme that damage red blood cells. Red blood cells require a precise coregulation of alpha and beta subunit expression to maintain the proper ratio of the subunits and normal red blood cell function. Generally red blood cells express slightly more alpha than beta-subunits to avoid forming unproductive beta-tetramers (HbH). The slight excess of alpha units are blocked from precipitation by a molecular chaperone, AHSP, alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein. Expression of the AHSP gene is coordinately activated with the globin genes and heme biosynthesis genes by the GATA-1 gene involved in erythrocyte differentiation. AHSP blocks precipitation of alpha-units, and promotes the formation of normal productive alpha-beta tetramers (HbA). People with mutation or deletion of the beta-subunit gene have Beta-thalasse",
  "PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene. Recombinant PTEN is capable of dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, the product of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. Many of the cancer-related mutations have been mapped to the phosphatase catalytic domain, it has been suggested that the phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for its tumor suppressor function. The activation of PKB / AKT is regulated in a complex manner via phosphorylation of AKT on Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and ILK (integrin-linked kinase) respectively. Inactivation of PTEN will constitutively activate PKB / AKT pathway. In addition to its role in regulating the PI 3-K / AKT cell survival pathway, PTEN also inhibits growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation and suppresses the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. PTEN also interact with FAK, a key molecule implicated in integrin signaling pathways, and it directly dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK. PTEN down-regulation of p130CAS through FAK results in inhibition of cell migration and spreading.",
  "Endocytosis is a mechanism for cells to remove ligands, nutrients, and plasma membrane (PM) proteins, and lipids from the cell surface, bringing them into the cell interior. Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type.",
  "Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2 / TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP) / TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) / TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to",
  "Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2 / neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) show elevated expression of EGF receptors (e.g. HER2 / neu) and their ligands (e.g.TGF-alpha) consistent with the presence of this autocrine loop. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.",
  "The body gets energy through the oxidation of food such as glucose and fatty acids. The chemical energy contained in these foods is extracted and converted until it reaches a common form, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable and is coupled to a variety of energetically unfavorable processes to drive them forward. How is the energy of glucose captured and converted to make ATP? Most of the energy of glucose or fatty acids is extracted through oxidation to produce the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. From there, the energy is transferred next to the electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chain includes a series of protein complexes and non-membrane cofactors that transfer the electrons from NADH and FADH2 in a series of redox reactions from carrier to carrier. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the chain, resulting in the production of water. The oxygen we breath, and which is transported by hemoglobin in the blood to all of the tissues, serves this purpose and allows electron transport to occur. As the electrons pass through the chain, they transfer their energy to",
  "Glycolysis is the process of converting glucose into pyruvate and generating small amounts of ATP (energy) and NADH (reducing power). It is a central pathway that produces important precursor metabolites: six-carbon compounds of glucose-6P and fructose-6P and three-carbon compounds of glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate. Acetyl-CoA, another important precursor metabolite, is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. When the enzyme genes of this pathway are examined in completely sequenced genomes, the reaction steps of three-carbon compounds from glycerone-P to pyruvate form a conserved core module, which is found in almost all organisms and which often corresponds to operon structures in bacterial genomes. Gluconeogenesis is a synthesis pathway of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors. It is essentially a reversal of glycolysis with minor variations of alternative paths.",
  "Activation of the MAPK kinase pathway has been identified as a mechanism that integrins use to regulate gene expression leading to cell shape changes during cell spreading or migration Epithelial cells respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cause integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates the surrounding proteins (paxillin, Fyn / shc, and src) and leads to signal amplification. FAK also binds PI-3 kinase and is upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. When MAPkinase or PI-3 kinase was inhibited, actin reorganization was blocked. Src phosphorylates p190RhoGAP, inactivating its GAP function that may allow RhoGTP to stay active longer, promoting further signal amplification. Activated RhoGTP binds to downstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (p160ROCK) and p140 diaphanous (p140Dia) to increase actin polymerization and contraction. Actin reorganization assists integrin clustering, allowing more ECM binding that increase FAK phosphorylation and other signal transduction events.",
  "Cholera toxin (CTX) is one of the main virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae. Once secreted, CTX B-chain (CTXB) binds to ganglioside GM1 on the surface of the host's cells. After binding takes place, the entire CTX complex is carried from plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the A-chain (CTXA) is recognized by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), unfolded, and delivered to the membrane where the membrane-associated ER-oxidase, Ero1, oxidizes PDI to release the CTXA into the protein-conducting channel, Sec61. CTXA is then retro-translocated to the cytosol and induces water and electrolyte secretion by increasing cAMP levels via adenylate cyclase (AC) to exert toxicity. Other than CTX, Vibrio cholerae generates several toxins that are perilous to eukaryotic cells. Zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) causes tight junction disruption through protein kinase C-dependent actin polymerization. RTX toxin (RtxA) causes actin depolymerization by covalently cross-linking actin monomers into dimers, trimers, and higher multimers. Vibrio",
  "Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled mechanisms of cell death involved in the regulation of tissue homeostasis. The 2 major pathways of apoptosis are the extrinsic (Fas and other TNFR superfamily members and ligands) and the intrinsic (mitochondria-associated) pathways, both of which are found in the cytoplasm. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by death receptor engagement, which initiates a signaling cascade mediated by caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 both feeds directly into caspase-3 activation and stimulates the release of cytochrome c by the mitochondria. Caspase-3 activation leads to the degradation of cellular proteins necessary to maintain cell survival and integrity. The intrinsic pathway occurs when various apoptotic stimuli trigger the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (independently of caspase-8 activation). Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to promote the activation of caspase-3. Recent studies point to the ER as a third subcellular compartment implicated in apoptotic execution. Alterations in Ca2 + homeostasis and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER cause ER stress. Prolonged ER stress can result in the activation of BAD and / or caspase-12, and execute apoptosis.",
  "Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts at synapses through binding to ligand-gated ion channels, the GABA receptors. Clustering of the GABA-A receptor chloride channel alters receptor pharmacology on the cell surface and reduced clustering of the GABA receptor is associated with anxiety. GABA-A interacts with several proteins that modulate its clustering, endocytosis, and recycling or degradation. Plic-1 is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to GABA-A receptors and causes them to accumulate at inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of GABA-A, and with microtubules, bringing receptors together in plasma microdomains. Curiously, Gephyrin appears to be a bifunctional protein, with a domain involved in molybdenum metabolism. Another protein interacting with the GABA-A receptor is GABARAP, a microtubule-associated protein. Anchoring of the GABA-A receptor to GABARAP helps to cluster the receptor at the synaptic termini and to mediate fast synaptic transmission. GABARAP may mediate interaction of gephyrin with the GABA-A receptor and gephyrin may stabilize clusters by forming multimeric structures. GABARAP and gephyrin may play more",
  "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units and form proteglycans by covalently attaching to their core proteins. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit GalNAc (b1-4) GlcA (b1-3), modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates. CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues. The assembly process of CS is initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization step is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both b13 glucuronosyltransferase and b14 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O sulfation and 6-O sulfation of N-",
  "Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a biphasic disease, initiated by expression of the BCR / ABL fusion gene product in self-renewing, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs can differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), which then differentiate into granulocyte / macrophage progenitors (GMPs). HSCs can also differentiate into common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which are the progenitors of lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells. The initial chronic phase of CML (CML-CP) is characterized by a massive expansion of the granulocytic-cell series. Acquisition of additional genetic mutations beyond expression of BCR / ABL causes the progression of CML from chronic phase to blast phase (CML-BP), characterized by an accumulation of myeloid or lymphoid blast cells. The BCR / ABL fusion gene encodes p210BCR / ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The tyrosine kinase activity is essential for cell transformation and the cytoplasmic localization of BCR / ABL allows the assembly of phosphorylated substrates in multiprotein complexes that transmit",
  "Cysteine and methionine are sulfur-containing amino acids. Cysteine is synthesized from serine through different pathways in different organism groups. In bacteria and plants, cysteine is converted from serine (via acetylserine) by transfer of hydrogen sulfide. In animals, methionine-derived homocysteine is used as sulfur source and its condensation product with serine (cystathionine) is converted to cysteine. Cysteine is metabolized to pyruvate in multiple routes. Methionine is an essential amino acid, which animals cannot synthesize. In bacteria and plants, methionine is synthesized from aspartate. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), synthesized from methionine and ATP, is a methyl group donor in many important transfer reactions including DNA methylation for regulation of gene expression. SAM may also be used to regenerate methionine in the methionine salvage pathway.",
  "Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) plays a critical role in cellular proliferation and development. The biologically active form is a dimer formed from the A and B chains. PDGF is active to a differing degree depending on which dimer is formed (AA, AB, or BB). The PDGF Receptor (PDGFR) is also a dimer and can form from the combination of the alpha and beta chains in any order (alpha-alpha, alpha-beta, beta-beta). The PDGFR dimer is only formed after ligand binding so the alpha / beta composition of the receptor can be influenced by the form of PDGF that is present. Upon binding of ligand the PDGFR is tyrosine phosphorylated and leads to the phosphorylation of several other cellular proteins.",
  "The hepatocyte growth factor receptor, also called c-Met, is activated by HGF and stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes and other cell types. Mutated forms of the HGF receptor are associated with oncogenesis and metastasis, making the HGF receptor a potential therapeutic target for cancer drugs. Changes in cell motility, cell shape, adhesion, resistance to apoptosis, and anchorage independent growth all contribute to the role of c-Met in cancer. The HGF receptor is a heterodimer with tyrosine kinase activity and associates with a multiprotein complex involved in downstream signal transduction. The HGF receptor can associate with several different signaling systems, including src, Grb2 / SOS, PI3 kinase and Gab1. One of the major substrates of the activated HGF receptor tyrosine kinase is the adaptor protein Gab1. Gab1 interacts with Crk and CrkL, two proteins with SH2 and SH3 protein interaction domains that couple to signaling further downstream. The actions of HGF on paxillin, DOCK180 and Rap1 mediated through GAB1 and other members of this complex alter cell motility. Regulation of Rho, Rac1 and CDC42 pathways in response to HGF all contribute to changes in cellular motility. Another target of",

  "The mammalian calpain gene family currently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. (An excellent introduction to the calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http: / / ag.arizona.edu / calpains / index.html) One of the most carefully studied functions of the calpains is the regulation of integrin-mediated cell migration. Calpains digests the links between the actin cytoskeleton and several focal adhesion complex proteins; talin, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. The release from the focal adhesion complex facilitates migration. Calpestatin is an inhibitor expressed in most cells. Calpestatin binds the four inhibitory domains of calpain. Release from calpestatin does not activate calpain. Activation requires additional signaling, coactivators and an appropriate calcium concentration. During cell migration calpain1 (mu-calpain) acts at the leading edge as a response to integrin signals or calcium fluxuations due to the stretch activated calcium channels. Calpain1 cleaves the target proteins, talin, exzrin, paxillin and the cytoplasmic tail of the",
  "The correct processing, quality control and turnover of cellular RNA molecules are critical to many aspects in the expression of genetic information. In eukaryotes, two major pathways of mRNA decay exist and both pathways are initiated by poly (A) shortening of the mRNA. In the 5 'to 3' pathway, this is followed by decapping which then permits the 5 'to 3' exonucleolytic degradation of transcripts. In the 3 'to 5' pathway, the exosome, a large multisubunit complex, plays a key role. The exosome exists in archaeal cells, too. In bacteria, endoribonuclease E, a key enzyme involved in RNA decay and processing, organizes a protein complex called degradosome. RNase E or R interacts with the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, DEAD-box helicases, and additional factors in the RNA-degrading complex.",
  "Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), a multi-functional kinase, and its neuron-specific activator p35 are required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Proteolytic cleavage of p35 produces p25, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conversion of p35 to p25 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5 and the hyperphosphorylates tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments and promotes apoptosis. In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress and calcium influx induce the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates, addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific inhibitors of calpain1, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In vitro, calpain1 directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative molecular mass 25,000. Application of the amyloid beta-peptide A beta induces the conversion of p35 to p25 in primary cortical neurons. Inhibition of cdk5 or calpain activity reduces cell death in A beta-treated cortical",
  "IL-5 is an inflammatory signaling molecule that primarily stimulates eosinophil proliferation, maturation and activation. Eosinophils are leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses that defend against parasites and cause some aspects of asthma, allergic reactions, and perhaps autoimmune disorders. The action of IL-5 begins with an immune response in tissues, such as activation of macrophages and T cells that secrete IL-1, IL-4 and IL-6. The immune response can lead to IL-5 secretion by T cells, eosinophils and mast cells. Secreted IL-5 stimulates production and maturation of eosinophils in bone marrow that migrate to tissues in response to eotaxin and release factors that damage tissues, causing some of the undesirable consequences of inflammation. The receptor for IL-5 is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit that is required for IL-5 selective binding and a beta subunit that is also part of the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors. Binding of IL-5 to the IL-5 receptor at the cell surface activates JAK / STAT signaling pathways that regulate transcription, proliferation, and differentiation.",

  "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A) goes by the colloquial designation p16, which is sometimes referred to as p16 (INK4). The alpha transcript of CDKN2A has been shown to encode p16 (INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the RB protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A encodes p14 (ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14 (ARF) is shorter than the corresponding mouse protein, p19 (ARF), and the 2 proteins share only 50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53 response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A and MDM2, and resulting in a distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2 / M phases.

  "Peroxisomes are essential organelles that play a key role in redox signalling and lipid homeostasis. They contribute to many crucial metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, biosynthesis of ether lipids and free radical detoxification. The biogenesis of peroxisomes starts with the early peroxins PEX3, PEX16 and PEX19 and proceeds via several steps. The import of membrane proteins into peroxisomes needs PEX19 for recognition, targeting and insertion via docking at PEX3. Matrix proteins in the cytosol are recognized by peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS) and transported to the docking complex at the peroxisomal membrane. Peroxisomes' deficiencies lead to severe and often fatal inherited peroxisomal disorders (PD). PDs are usually classified in two groups. The first group is disorders of peroxisome biogenesis which include Zellweger syndrome, and the second group is single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies.",
  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin. There are 4 major histologic subtypes of RCC: conventional (clear cell RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Multiple genes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for hereditary (von Hippel-Lindau) and sporadic variants of conventional (clear cell) RCC. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. An oncogene, MET has been found to be mutant in cases of hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), although the incidence of c-MET mutations is low in sporadic papillary RCC. Once activated, MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome (HLRCC",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.",
  "p38 MAPKs are members of the MAPK family that are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. Stress signals are delivered to this cascade by members of small GTPases of the Rho family (Rac, Rho, Cdc42). As with other MAPK cascades, the membrane-proximal component is a MAPKKK, typically a MEKK or a mixed lineage kinase (MLK). The MAPKKK phosphorylates and activated MKK3 / 5, the p38 MAPK kinase. MKK3 / 6 can also be activated directly by ASK1, which is stimulated by apoptotic stimuli. P38 MAK is involved in regulation of Hsp27 and MAPKAP-2 and several transcription factors including ATF2, STAT1, THE Max / Myc complex, MEF-2, ELK-1 and indirectly CREB via activation of MSK1.",
  "Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent neoplasia originating from the thyroid epithelium, accounts for about 80% of all thyroid cancers. Chimeric oncogenes, created by chromosomal rearrangements involving prevalently RET and, to a less extent, NTRK1 loci, are implicated in the development of papillary carcinoma.These are inappropriately expressed and stimulate constitutive signaling, bypassing the need for receptor activation by growth factors. Alternatively, mutant RAS directly stimulates BRAF, whereas mutant BRAF directly stimulates MEK. Of all thyroid cancers, 15-20% are follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The most distinctive molecular features of follicular carcinoma are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR-gamma rearrangements. The PPAR-gamma rearrangement functions through a dominant-negative effect on the transcriptional activity of wild-type PPAR-gamma. The fusion oncoprotein contributes to malignant transformation by targeting several cellular pathways, some of which are normally engaged by PPAR-gamma. Most poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas are considered to derive from pre-existing well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma through additional genetic events, including beta-catenin nuclear accumulation",
  "mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appears to play a central role in signaling caused by nutrients and mitogens such as growth factors to regulate translation. The drug rapamycin acts on mammalian cells through the mTOR protein kinase, also known as FRAP. When bound to the immunophilin binding protein FKBP12, rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity and has immunosuppressant activity. Rapamycin and the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 are being tested as anti-cancer agents, acting to block mitogenic signaling. Recently, mTOR was also found to act as an ATP sensor to regulate cell growth. Upstream activation of PI 3 kinase activity that leads to oncogenic transformation can be blocked by inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. Growth factor receptors first stimulate PI 3 kinase, and through inositol phosphates activate PDK-1 and AKT (protein kinase B). AKT phosphorylates mTOR. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP by mTOR and the phosphorylation downstream of RPS6 and EIF-4B stimulate translational initiation and contribute to cell growth.",
  "The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle",

  "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide induces cellular proliferation through the EGF receptor, which has a tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain involved in EGF binding and receptor dimerization. Inhibitors of the EGF receptor are being pursued as potential cancer therapies and EGF may stimulate wound healing. Mutation of the EGF receptor has been associated with cancer in humans. The proliferative effects of EGF are signaled through several pathways. Binding of EGF results in EGF receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. The EGF receptor activates ras and the MAP kinase pathway, ultimately causing phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Fos to create AP-1 and ELK-1 that contribute to proliferation. Activation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 transcription factors by JAK kinases in response to EGF contributes to proliferative signaling. Phosphatidylinositol signaling and calcium release induced by EGF activate protein kinase C, another component of EGF signaling. Crosstalk of EGF signaling with other pathways make the EGF receptor a junction point between signaling systems.",

The biogenesis of peroxisomes starts with the early peroxins PEX3, PEX16 and PEX19 and proceeds via several steps. The import of membrane proteins into peroxisomes needs PEX19 for recognition, targeting and insertion via docking at PEX3. Matrix proteins in the cytosol are recognized by peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS) and transported to the docking complex at the peroxisomal membrane. Peroxisomes' deficiencies lead to severe and often fatal inherited peroxisomal disorders (PD). PDs are usually classified in two groups. The first group is disorders of peroxisome biogenesis which include Zellweger syndrome, and the second group is single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies.",
  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs coincides with the recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases, including c-Src, Hck and c-Fgr (Src-TK), to the receptor-arrestin complex. Several signaling events have been reported to involve -arrestin-dependent Src recruitment. These include the regulation of clathrin-dependent 2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis by tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, Ras-dependent activation of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade and stimulation of cell proliferation by 2-adrenergic and neurokinin NK1 receptors, and stimulation of chemokine CXCR1 receptor-mediated neutrophil degranulation",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in 11 genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2 + sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2 + concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myofilament Ca2 + sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM",
  "After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",
  "Steroid hormones derived from cholesterol are a class of biologically active compounds in vertebrates. The cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 catalyzes conversion of cholesterol, a C27 compound, to the first C21 steroid, pregnenolone, which is converted by a bifunctional enzyme complex to the gestagen hormone, progesterone. Pregnenolone and progesterone are the starting materials for the three groups of steroids: C21 steroids of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, C19 steroids of androgens, and C18 steroids of estrogens. (i) Progesterone is converted by hydroxylations at carbons 21 and 11 to corticosterone, which is further modified by hydroxylation and oxydoreduction at carbon 18 to yield aldosterone, a mineralcorticoid. Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid, is formed from 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone with 11-deoxycortisol as an intermediate. (ii) Male hormone testosterone is formed from pregnenolone by two pathways, delta5 pathway via dehydroepiandrosterone and delta4 pathway via androstenedione. The enzyme CYP17A1 is responsible for the 17,20 lyase and 17alpha-hydroxylase activities in respective pathways. (iii) Female hormones estrone",
  "The appropriate signaling through the insulin pathway is critical for the regulation of glucose levels and the avoidance of diabetes. Insulin forms a complex with the Insulin Receptor (IR) and b chains to form the active signaling complex. Through recruitment of adaptor molecules and the activation of RAS, the activated IR can cause transcriptional activation.",
  "Four different members of the Sprouty protein family block the cellular proliferation and differentiation induced by several different growth factors, including EGF and FGF. One mechanism by which Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling is through binding to Grb-2, a signaling intermediary between the tyrosine kinase growth factors and the Ras / map kinase pathway. Binding of Sprouty to Grb-2 prevents Grb-2 and Sos-1 from interacting with downstream signaling factors that activate Ras and map kinases, including Ras, Raf-1, Mek1, Erk1 / 2 and downstream transcription factors. The action of Sprouty as an inhibitor of this pathway requires Sprouty phosphorylation and membrane localization, at the site of the factors it interacts with. The inhibition of growth factor signaling by Sprouty is specific to the Ras pathway since the PI3 Kinase pathway responsible for cell survival signals from growth factor receptors is not inhibited by Sprouty. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is also not affected. The mechanism by which Sprouty inhibits Ras activation may be by blocking the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. Sprouty",
  "Primary immunodeficiencies (PIs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which affect cellular and humoral immunity or non-specific host defense mechanisms mediated by complement proteins, and cells such as phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. These disorders of the immune system cause increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy. Most of PIs are due to genetic defects that affect cell maturation or function at different levels during hematopoiesis. Disruption of the cellular immunity is observed in patients with defects in T cells or both T and B cells. These cellular immunodeficiencies comprise 20% of all PIs. Disorders of humoral immunity affect B-cell differentiation and antibody production. They account for 70% of all PIs.",
  "Myocardial infraction (MI) is the condition of irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle that results from prolonged ischemia. Nearly 1.5 million people in US sustain an MI each year, and this event proves fatal in approximately one third of patients. Approximately 90% of MI result from formation of an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The thrombus transforms a region of plaque narrowing to one of complete vessel occlusion (top right in pink). The responsible thrombus appears to be generated by interactions between the atherosclerotic plaque, the coronary endothelium, circulating platelets, and dynamic vasomotor tone of the vessel wall, all of which overwhelm natural protective mechanisms. The endogenous protective mechanisms against thrombosis include: 1. Inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III (ATIII), the effectiveness of which is enhanced by binding of ATIII to heparin sulafate. The antithrombin binding region of commercial heparin consists of sulfated disaccharide units (bottom panel). 2. Inactivation of clotting factors Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (protein C *), an action that is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombomodulin (TM)",
  "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide induces cellular proliferation through the EGF receptor, which has a tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain involved in EGF binding and receptor dimerization. Inhibitors of the EGF receptor are being pursued as potential cancer therapies and EGF may stimulate wound healing. Mutation of the EGF receptor has been associated with cancer in humans. The proliferative effects of EGF are signaled through several pathways. Binding of EGF results in EGF receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. The EGF receptor activates ras and the MAP kinase pathway, ultimately causing phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Fos to create AP-1 and ELK-1 that contribute to proliferation. Activation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 transcription factors by JAK kinases in response to EGF contributes to proliferative signaling. Phosphatidylinositol signaling and calcium release induced by EGF activate protein kinase C, another component of EGF signaling. Crosstalk of EGF signaling with other pathways make the EGF receptor a junction point between signaling systems.",
  "Wnt family members are secreted glycoproteins who bind to cell surface receptors such as Frizzled. Wnt members can play a role in the expression of many genes by interacting with multiple disparate signaling pathways. Shown is the Wnt / beta-catenin pathway.",
  "Bladder cancer arise and progress along two distinctive pathways. The first of these is often preceded by simple and papillary hyperplasia and exhibits a tumour morphology that is low-grade, superficial and papillary. Papillary carcinoma has a tendency to recur locally, but rarely invades and metastasizes. These tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. The second tumour pathway is characterized by high-grade muscle-invasive tumours, which either originate from flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) / severe dysplasia or arise de novo. Over half of these tumours show defects in the tumour suppressors p53 and / or the retinoblastoma protein (RB) genes and pathways, and over 50% of these tumours progress to local and distant metastases. Some of the cell cycle-related molecules show evidence of epigenetic modulation through aberrant promoter hypermethylation in invasive bladder cancer. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors",
  "The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) encodes a protein kinase that acts as a tumor suppressor. ATM activation by ionizing radiation damage to DNA stimulates DNA repair and blocks progression through the cell cycle. Mutation of the ATM gene causes the disease ataxia telangiectasia which which involves an inherited predisposition to some cancers. To play this role ATM interacts with a broad network of proteins, including checkpoint factors (chk1, chk2), tumor suppressors (p53 and BRCA), DNA repair factors (RAD50, RAD51, GADD45), and other signaling molecules (c-Abl and NF-kB). In addition to regulating DNA repair and the cell cycle, ATM can also trigger apoptosis in radiation treated cells.",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates",

The inhibition of growth factor signaling by Sprouty is specific to the Ras pathway since the PI3 Kinase pathway responsible for cell survival signals from growth factor receptors is not inhibited by Sprouty. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is also not affected. The mechanism by which Sprouty inhibits Ras activation may be by blocking the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. Sprouty",
  "Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage.",
  "Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK",
  "To replicate in the host cell, viruses commandeer cellular signaling pathways. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus with that is widespread in the population but usually causes disease only in immunocompromised individuals and is also a viral cause of birth defects. One of the actions of CMV in the host cell is to stimulate MAP kinase pathways. Both p38 and ERK kinases are activated by CMV infection through activation map kinase kinases and inhibition of phosphatases. One result of Map kinase activation by CMV is activation of transcription of viral genes, increasing the production of viral gene products. Both p38 and ERK kinases contribute to the activation of viral genes by cellular transcription factors acting through the viral UL4 promoter at upstream and basal transcription elements. Another target of prolonged p38 activation during infection is Rb, contributing to viral replication. Activation of MKK1 and MKK2 leads to Erk1 and Erk2 activation, and phosphorylation of downstream targets. The MEKK1 kinase regulates the immediate early promoter indirectly through downstream kinase signaling and perhaps more directly through activation of NF-kB. Map kinase pathways activated by CMV converge on increased transcription of viral genes and increased replication of",
  "Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent neoplasia originating from the thyroid epithelium, accounts for about 80% of all thyroid cancers. Chimeric oncogenes, created by chromosomal rearrangements involving prevalently RET and, to a less extent, NTRK1 loci, are implicated in the development of papillary carcinoma.These are inappropriately expressed and stimulate constitutive signaling, bypassing the need for receptor activation by growth factors. Alternatively, mutant RAS directly stimulates BRAF, whereas mutant BRAF directly stimulates MEK. Of all thyroid cancers, 15-20% are follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The most distinctive molecular features of follicular carcinoma are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR-gamma rearrangements. The PPAR-gamma rearrangement functions through a dominant-negative effect on the transcriptional activity of wild-type PPAR-gamma. The fusion oncoprotein contributes to malignant transformation by targeting several cellular pathways, some of which are normally engaged by PPAR-gamma. Most poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas are considered to derive from pre-existing well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma through additional genetic events, including beta-catenin nuclear accumulation",
  "p27 / Kip1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase cdk2 / cyclin E and blocking cell cycle progression through the G1-S transition. Cancer cells in some cases have reduced levels of p27, supporting the importance of p27 in cell cycle regulation. The activity of p27 is regulated by phosphorylation, synthesis and degradation. Phosphorylation of p27 at threonine-187 by cdk2 causes p27 to associate with an SCF complex that targets p27 for proteolytic degradation. The F box protein Skp2 binds specifically to threonine-187 phosphorylated p27, recruiting it to the SCF complex for degradation. Other components of the p27 ubiquitin ligase complex include Skp1, Cul1, and Roc1 / Rbx-1. Cks-1 has also been identified in a reconstituted system as an essential component for recruitment of p27 for degradation by the SCF complex. Signaling by cytokines may modulate cell survival, proliferation, or apoptosis through modulation of p27 expression. Cytokine and AKT signaling pathways activate forkhead transcription factors that induce p27 expression at the transcriptional",
  "Rac-1 is a small G-protein in the Rho family that regulates cell motility in response to extracellular signals. Several changes in cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell structure are involved in cell motility. Rac-1 is activated by GEF factors, and repressed by GAPs. GEFs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors, including Trio and Vav. Sos-1 is involved in Ras signaling and also acts as a GEF for Rac to transduce signals between Ras and Rac. SWAP-70 is a Rac GEF that binds IP3 and transduces signals from tyrosine kinases to Rac to modulate the cytoskeleton and cause membrane ruffling. GAPs are GTPase- activating proteins. Rac stimulates the formation of actin-based structures such as filopodia and lamellopodia, while GAPs such as chimerin oppose the formation of these Rac dependent structures. Several different factors downstream of Rac act on cytoskeletal structure and other aspects of cell motility. Pak1 provides a direct link from Rac to cell motility through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Pak1 also phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin as one target. Cofilin stimulates actin depolymerization and changes in cell",
  "IL-22 is an inflammatory cytokine related to IL-10 that is produced by T cells and that induces a response in cells through a heterodimeric cell surface receptor composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2C. One of the actions of IL-22 appears to be the induction of the acute phase inflammatory response in hetapocytes, acting through activation of STATs and transcriptional regulation. A gene with homology to the extracellular domain of the cell surface IL-22R1 receptor component was identified that lacked transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The protein derived from this gene was found to bind IL-22 and block its interaction with the cell surface receptor. The IL-22 soluble receptor (IL-22BP, IL-22 binding protein) also blocks some of the downstream effects of IL-22 such as STAT activation and the transcriptional induction of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. The IL-22 soluble receptor may act as an anti-inflammatory agent.",
  "Nitric oxide (NO) has a number of important physiological actions in the cardiovascular system. In the heart, NO plays role in keeping the vessels patent via vasodilation and prevention of platelet aggregation. It also plays an important role in regulating the force and rate of contraction. In vivo NO is released by shear stress of ligands that increase intracellular Ca2 + in endothelial cells. The increase intracellular Ca2 + activates nitric oxide synthase III (NOSIII) by promoting the binding of Ca / Calmodulin to the enzyme. NOSIII, which is resident in the Golgi complex, is transported together with caveolin-1 to the caveolae at the plasma membrane via vesicles. Shear stress signals via a potassium channel and the cytoskeleton, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequently in activation of Akt kinase. Akt activation by shear stress but also by VEGF activates NOSIII by serine phosphorylation, which increases the affinity of NOSIII for calmodulin. After agonist binding at the plasma membrane, NOSIII-activating receptors translocate to caveolae. VEGF receptor signals via its tyrosine kinase domain. Furthermore, agonist",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved biological pathway that plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations from becoming permanent in dividing cells. MMR also suppresses homologous recombination and was recently shown to play a role in DNA damage signaling. Defects in MMR are associated with genome-wide instability, predisposition to certain types of cancer including HNPCC, resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, and abnormalities in meiosis and sterility in mammalian systems. The Escherichia coli MMR pathway has been extensively studied and is well characterized. In E. coli, the mismatch-activated MutS-MutL-ATP complex licenses MutH to incise the nearest unmethylated GATC sequence. UvrD and an exonuclease generate a gap. This gap is filled by pol III and DNA ligase. The GATC sites are then methylated by Dam. Several human MMR proteins have been identified based on their homology to E. coli MMR proteins. These include human homologs of MutS and MutL. Although E. coli MutS and MutL proteins are homodimers, human MutS and MutL homologs are heterodimers. The role of hemim",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.",
  "B cells are an important component of adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete millions of different antibody molecules, each of which recognizes a different (foreign) antigen. The B cell receptor (BCR) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta. After BCR ligation by antigen, three main protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) -the SRC-family kinase LYN, SYK and the TEC-family kinase BTK- are activated. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma 2) are important downstream effectors of BCR signalling. This signalling ultimately results in the expression of immediate early genes that further activate the expression of other genes involved in B cell proliferation, differentiation and Ig production as well as other processes.",
  "Several forms of post-translational modification regulate protein activities. Recently, protein methylation by CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) has been observed to play a key role in transcriptional regulation. CARM1 associates with the p160 class of transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by steroid hormone family receptors. CARM1 also interacts with CBP / p300 transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by a large variety of transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors and CEBP. One target of CARM1 is the core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets of the histone acetylase activity of CBP / p300 coactivators. Recruitment of CARM1 to the promoter region by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and makes promoter regions more accessible for transcription. Another target of CARM1 methylation is a coactivator it interacts with, CBP. Methylation of CBP by CARM1 blocks CBP from acting as a coactivator for CREB and redirects the limited CBP pool in the cell to be available for steroid hormone receptors. Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known.",
  "The protein export is the active transport of proteins from the cytoplasm to the exterior of the cell, or to the periplasmic compartment in Gram-negative bacteria. The sec dependent pathway is the general protein export system that transports newly synthesized proteins into or across the cell membrane. The translocation channel is formed from a conserved trimeric membrane protein complex, called the Sec61 / SecY complex. The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is another protein transport system that transports folded proteins in bacteria, archaea, and chloroplasts. Many Tat systems comprise three functionally different membrane proteins, TatA, TatB, and TatC, but TatA and TatE seem to have overlapping functions, with TatA having by far the more important role.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is one of a family of neurotrophins that induce the survival and proliferation of neurons. In cell culture NGF induces the formation of neurite projections and in vivo may stimulate the innervation of tissues. NGF plays a role in the repair, regeneration, and protection of neurons, and as such could serve as a therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. One potential method of NGF application would be through gene therapy or through implantation of cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo. NGF has also been suggested to play a role in other physiological systems and tissues such as the immune system. NGF has two receptors, TrkA and the p75 (NTR). NGF may signal its neuroprotective actions through the tyrosine kinase TrkA receptor and trigger apoptosis in some cells through the p75 receptor. High-affinity binding of NGF requires both TrkA and p75 (NTR). Binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor causes activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream signaling cascades. One of the downstream signaling pathways of NGF activates phospholipase C, releasing DAG and IP3 and activating associated downstream pathways such as protein kinase",
  "Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts at synapses through binding to ligand-gated ion channels, the GABA receptors. Clustering of the GABA-A receptor chloride channel alters receptor pharmacology on the cell surface and reduced clustering of the GABA receptor is associated with anxiety. GABA-A interacts with several proteins that modulate its clustering, endocytosis, and recycling or degradation. Plic-1 is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to GABA-A receptors and causes them to accumulate at inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of GABA-A, and with microtubules, bringing receptors together in plasma microdomains. Curiously, Gephyrin appears to be a bifunctional protein, with a domain involved in molybdenum metabolism. Another protein interacting with the GABA-A receptor is GABARAP, a microtubule-associated protein. Anchoring of the GABA-A receptor to GABARAP helps to cluster the receptor at the synaptic termini and to mediate fast synaptic transmission. GABARAP may mediate interaction of gephyrin with the GABA-A receptor and gephyrin may stabilize clusters by forming multimeric structures. GABARAP and gephyrin may play more",
  "The insulin resistance of type II diabetes appears to be caused in part by the presence of high levels of lipids in cells such as skeletal muscle where this would not normally be found. The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import",
  "The cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. This transition is regulated by the checkpoint kinase cdk2 that activates the G1 to S transition when it is associated with cyclin E. Cdk2 / Cyclin E causes the G1 to S transition through phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor Rb, releasing the transcription factor E2F-1. Other pathways acting through Rac, Ras and Rho also regulate the G1 to S transition. Ras regulates cyclin D1 expression to affect the G1 to S transition. Transforming forms of Ras or Raf induce cyclin D1 expression and cause early entry into S phase. Signaling from Ras to Raf to MEK to ERKs induces Cyclin D1 expression, allowing Cyclin D1 to complex with Cdk4 and Cdk6 and phosphorylate Rb. Rac-1 and PAK appear to induce Cyclin D1 expression and induce the G1 to S transition primarily through activation of NF-kB to activate the Cyclin D1 promoter. Rho activates cdk2 and also inhibits p21 and p27 to induce cyclin D1 and stimulate the G1 to S transition. Rho represses p21 expression to block p21 induction by Ras and to allow Ras induced progression",
  "p53 activation is induced by a number of stress signals, including DNA damage, oxidative stress and activated oncogenes. The p53 protein is employed as a transcriptional activator of p53-regulated genes. This results in three major outputs; cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence or apoptosis. Other p53-regulated gene functions communicate with adjacent cells, repair the damaged DNA or set up positive and negative feedback loops that enhance or attenuate the functions of the p53 protein and integrate these stress responses with other signal transduction pathways.",
  "Five distinct stages have been proposed in the evolution of melanoma on the basis of histological criteria: common acquired and congenital nevi without dysplastic changes; dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia; radial-growth phase (RGP) melanoma; vertical-growth phase (VGP) melanoma; and metastatic melanoma. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Moreover, melanoma development is strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways. The vertical-growth phase and metastatic melanoma are notable for striking changes in the control of cell adhesion. Recently, amplification of the MITF gene was demonstrated in 10% of primary melanomas and 20% of metastatic melanomas, suggesting that MITF is a melanoma oncogene.",
  "Interactions between cells responsible for cell to cell adhesion also can communicate signals into the cellular interior, often involving interactions with cytoskeletal elements to produce changes in cell motility, migration, proliferation and shape. The cadherins are cell surface adhesion molecules that help form tight junctions between cells such as formation of epithelial cell layers. E-cadherin inactivation has been implicated in cancer development. In addition to mediating adhesion with other cells, cadherins transduce signals into cells through interactions with the catenins. Catenins probably affect actin cytoskeletal function through interactions with proteins like actinin and vinculin. Catenins also probably trigger changes in cell shape and motility with signals through the Rho small GTPases. Another important cell adhesion molecule is CD-31, or PECAM-1, involved in the formation of junctions between endothelial cells, cell migration, migration of lymphocytes, and regulation of lymphocyte activation. Src phosphorylates PECAM-1 on tyrosine residues causing SHP-2 association with PECAM-1. Paxillin acts as an adaptor protein between proteins involved in adhesion signaling like FAK and src and cytoskeletal elements. In addition to signals created by adhesion molecules to alter cellular responses, other signaling",
  "Inflammation has several distinct components, including the localized response at the site of tissue injury or infection. Tissue injury stimulates the release of inflammatory signaling molecules such as bradykinin. Bacterial infection stimulates an immune response in several ways. Bacteria that are phagocytosed can activate macrophages, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. Bacteria can also activate the complement cascade through either the antibody-mediated pathway (classical pathway) or the alternative complement pathway. In extravascular tissues, cells that respond to infection or injury include macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages and other immune cells secrete chemokines that recruit leukocytes from the circulation to the site of inflammation. Mast cells release histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes that act as chemokines, increase vascular permeability, and act on the vascular endothelium to increase tissue recruitment of leukocytes. Chemokines can recruit leukocytes or lymphocytes out of the blood stream into tissues and make blood vessels more permeable. Leukocytes are activated by inflammatory signals to express adhesion molecules that cause them to interact with the vascular endothelium, penetrate the endothelial wall and migrate into the extracellular space of tissues. The combined response of immune",
  "Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage.",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in early defenses against both allogeneic (nonself) cells and autologous cells undergoing various forms of stress, such as infection with viruses, bacteria, or parasites or malignant transformation. Although NK cells do not express classical antigen receptors of the immunoglobulin gene family, such as the antibodies produced by B cells or the T cell receptor expressed by T cells, they are equipped with various receptors whose engagement allows them to discriminate between target and nontarget cells. Activating receptors bind ligands on the target cell surface and trigger NK cell activation and target cell lysis. However Inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I molecules (HLA) and inhibit killing by NK cells by overruling the actions of the activating receptors. This inhibitory signal is lost when the target cells do not express MHC class I and perhaps also in cells infected with virus, which might inhibit MHC class I exprssion or alter its conformation. The mechanism of NK cell killing is the same as that used by the cytotoxic T cells generated in an adaptive immune response; cytotoxic granules are released onto the surface of the bound",
  "All taste pathways are proposed to converge on common elements that mediate a rise in intracellular Ca2 + followed by neurotransmitter release. Na + salt depolarizes taste cells by passive influx of Na + through the amiloride-sensitive Na + channel (ENaC). Acids depolarize taste cells by a variety of mechanisms, including influx of protons (H +) through ENaC and a proton-gated cation channel (MDEG). Two putative umami receptors have been identified: a truncated variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 and the heterodimer, T1R1 + T1R3. Umami receptors are coupled to a signaling pathway involving activation of PLCbeta2, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activation of a transient receptor potential channel, TRPM5. Bitter compounds, such as denatonium and PROP, activate particular T2R / TRB isoforms, which activate gustducin heterotrimers. Activated alpha-gustducin stimulates PDE to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas betagamma subunits activate PLCbeta2 to generate IP3, which leads to release of Ca2 + from internal stores. Artificial sweeteners activate GPCRs (",
  "Hypoxia (or low O2 levels) affects various pathologies. First, tissue ischemia, a variation in O2 tension caused by hypoxia / reoxygenation, can lead to endothelial cell changes. For example, long periods of ischemia result in endothelial changes, such as vascular leakage, resulting in varicose veins. In more severe situations, ischemia can lead to myocardial or cerebral infarction and retinal vessel occlusion. Of interest, HIF-1 is stabilized prior to induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression during acute ischemia in the human heart. Second, pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic respiratory disorders results from persistent vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. Third, hypoxic gradients created in enlarging solid tumors trigger expression of genes containing hypoxia response element (HRE) s such as those involved in angiogenesis. This allows subsequent delivery of O2, nutrients, and further tumor growth. Vascular remodeling is an important component to tumorigenesis; without proper blood supply, delivery of oxygen may occur by diffusion, but becomes inefficient in tumors greater than 1 mm in diameter. Short-term hypoxia can also elevate platelet numbers, while prolonged exposure may cause some degree of thrombocytopenia in response to increased levels of erythropo",
  "Approximately 30% of breast carcinomas lack ER expression. Presumably, these breast cancers become estrogen independent through genetic alterations that bypass the requirement for ER-dependent stimulation of cell proliferation. As such estrogen receptor is a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelia and represents a crucial prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression through direct gene activation of a number of genes (cathepsin D, HSP27 (heat shock protein 27,000 kDa, aldolase A, dehydrogenase, alpha-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphat, Pdzk1, Greb ets) and also through the biological functions of target loci. The product of human MTA3 has been identified as an estrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2 / NuRD transcriptional corepressor in breast epithelial cells and demonstrate that MTA3 constitutes a key component of an estrogen-dependent pathway regulating growth and differentiation. The absence of estrogen receptor or of MTA3 leads to aberrant expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Aberrant Snail expression results in loss of expression of the",
  "The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily contains several members with homologous cytoplasmic domains known as death domains (DD). The intracellular DD are important in initiating apoptosis and other signaling pathways following ligand binding by the receptors.1 In the absence of ligand, DD-containing receptors are maintained in an inactive state. TNF RI contains a cytoplasmic DD required for signaling pathways associated with apoptosis and NF-kB activation.2,3 Jiang et al.4 identified a widely expressed 60 kDa protein, named SODD (silencer of death domains), associated with the DD of TNF RI and DR3. Overexpression of SODD suppresses TNF-induced cell death and NF-kB activation demonstrating its role as a negative regulatory protein for these signaling pathways. TNF-induced receptor trimerization aggregates the DD of TNF RI and recruits the adapter protein TRADD.3,5 This in turn promotes the recruitment of the DD-containing cytoplasmic proteins FADD, TRAF2 and RIP to form an active TNF RI signaling complex (Figure 1A) .6-9 In contrast, SODD acts as a silencer of TNF RI signaling and does not interact with TRADD,",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "IGF-1R, the type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor, mediates cell survival and growth in response to its ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. This tyrosine kinase receptor is widely expressed in many cell types and is a key mediator of growth. Overexpression or activation of IGF-1R may be involved in the proliferation of transformed cells, making inhibition of IGF-1R signaling a strategy for the development of cancer drugs. IGF-1R activates three signaling pathways that converge to phosphorylate BAD protein and block apoptosis. The first pathway activated by IGF-1R stimulates PI3-kinase and the AKT pathway to phosphorylate BAD and block apoptosis. A second pathway activated by IGF-1R involves ras mediated activation of the map kinase pathway to block apoptosis. A third pathway involves interaction of raf with mitochondria in response to IGF-1R activation. The convergence of these pathways to block apoptosis may enhance the IGF-1R response.",
  "The citrate cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle) is an important aerobic pathway for the final steps of the oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids. The cycle starts with acetyl-CoA, the activated form of acetate, derived from glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation for carbohydrates and from beta oxidation of fatty acids. The two-carbon acetyl group in acetyl-CoA is transferred to the four-carbon compound of oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon compound of citrate. In a series of reactions two carbons in citrate are oxidized to CO2 and the reaction pathway supplies NADH for use in the oxidative phosphorylation and other metabolic processes. The pathway also supplies important precursor metabolites including 2-oxoglutarate. At the end of the cycle the remaining four-carbon part is transformed back to oxaloacetate. According to the genome sequence data, many organisms seem to lack genes for the full cycle, but contain genes for specific segments.",
  "Cell cycle checkpoint controls at the G1 to S transition and the G2 to M transition prevent the cell cycle from progressing when DNA is damaged. The ATM protein kinase detects DNA damage and in response to this activates DNA repair factors and inhibits cell cycle progression. Two of the proteins that ATM phosphorylates in response to DNA damage are the tumor suppressor p53 and the checkpoint kinase chk1. In turn, the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with p21 to block the activity of cdk2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2) preventing passage from G1 to S phase and harmful replication of damaged DNA. One of the targets of cdk2 is the Rb gene product, another tumor suppressor. When dephosphorylated, Rb interacts with E2F transcription factors and prevents transcription of genes required for progression through the cell cycle. When phosphorylated by cell cycle dependent kinases like cdk2 and cdk4, Rb no longer interacts with E2F and the cell cycle proceeds through the G1-S checkpoint. DNA damage also regulates the G2-M phase transition by acting on the cell cycle regulator cdc2.",
  "Nine currently identified phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-K) constitute a subfamily of lipid kinases that catalyze the addition of a phosphate molecule on the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), the precursor of all phosphoinosi-tides (PI), constitutes less than 10% of the total lipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. Approximately 5% of cellular PI is phosphorylated at the 4-position (PtdIns-4-P), and another 5% is phosphorylated at both the 4- and 5-positions (PtdIns-4,5-P2). However, less than 0.25% of the total inositol-containing lipids are phosphorylated at the 3-position, consistent with the idea that these lipids exert specific regulatory functions inside the cell, as opposed to a structural function. Here we have chosen to highlight a group of the phosphoinositide targets of the PI3-Ks and their downstream targets. The downstream effects of these PI-3 targets are indicated in the lower band illustrating the important role the PI3Ks have in cell function and survival.",
  "Activation of the MAPK kinase pathway has been identified as a mechanism that integrins use to regulate gene expression leading to cell shape changes during cell spreading or migration Epithelial cells respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cause integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates the surrounding proteins (paxillin, Fyn / shc, and src) and leads to signal amplification. FAK also binds PI-3 kinase and is upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. When MAPkinase or PI-3 kinase was inhibited, actin reorganization was blocked. Src phosphorylates p190RhoGAP, inactivating its GAP function that may allow RhoGTP to stay active longer, promoting further signal amplification. Activated RhoGTP binds to downstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (p160ROCK) and p140 diaphanous (p140Dia) to increase actin polymerization and contraction. Actin reorganization assists integrin clustering, allowing more ECM binding that increase FAK phosphorylation and other signal transduction events.",
  "Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cell surface receptors like FAS, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death domain like FAS. The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets. Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis have been suggested.",
  "Cdk5 is a cyclin dependent protein kinase involved in dopaminergic signaling in the neostriatal region of the brain. The role of cdk5 in dopamine responses occurs through phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Caseine kinase 1 (CK1) also regulates DARPP-32 phosphorylation and dopamine signaling. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by cdk5 reduced dopamine signaling. Depending on its phosphorylation state, DARPP-32 inhibits either protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or PKA. The role of mGLUR1 in this process is supported by the induction of cdk5 and CK1 activity by the mGLUR1 agonist DHPG and the subsequent phosphorylation of DARPP-32 associated with DHPG treatment of nigrostriatal neurons. CK-1 and Ckd5 inhibitors block the DHPG induced DARPP-32 phosphorylation. Dopamine exerts a positive signal that increases dopamine response by reversing phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at threonine-75. Dopamine initiates this pathway through activation of the D1 dopamine receptor, a Gs coupled GPCR, elevating cAMP and activating PKA. PKA activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which dephosphorylates DARPP-32 and increases dopamine responsiveness. This also removes",
  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. During an inflammation or immune reaction, specialized leukocytes (eosinophilic granulocytes) adhere to and pass through the endothelium of the blood vessels and the underlying matrix. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flattening of the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or even through the intercellular matrix. This is mediated by a homophilic interactions of PECAM and CD31.",

  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting foreign DNA from invading microbes or host cells and generating innate immune responses. DAI is the first identified sensor of cytosolic DNA which activates the IRF and NF- {kappa} B transcription factors, leading to production of type I interferon and other cytokines. The second type of cytoplasmic DNA sensor is AIM2. Upon sensing DNA, AIM2 triggers the assembly of the inflammasome, culminating in interleukin maturation. In addition to these receptors, there is a mechanism to sense foreign DNA, with the host RNA polymerase III converting the DNA into RNA for recognition by the RNA sensor RIG-I. These pathways provide various means to alert the cell.",
  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. Generally, lymphocyte adhesion and passage from the bloodstream to the lymphatic system occurs in the high endothelial venules of the lymphnodes. This way the lymphocytes can communicate with each other in the lymphatic system and search for foreign compounds after their recirculation to the bloodstream, this fulfilling their role in the immune system. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3.

  "IL-7 is a key cytokine in the immune system, essential for normal development of B cells and T cells. Mice with the IL-7 receptor deleted lack B and T cells. Some humans with SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency disease) also have mutation of their IL-7 receptor gene leading to an absence of T cells and greatly impaired B cell production. The IL-7 receptor includes two polypeptides, a gamma chain and an alpha chain. The alpha-chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor while several other cytokines use the same gamma receptor chain as IL-7, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. Binding of IL-7 to the alpha chain leads to dimerization of the alpha and gamma chains. JAK3 associated with the gamma chain tyrosine phosphorylates the alpha chain after dimerization. The importance of JAK3 in IL-7 signaling is supported by the similarity of the immune defects in JAK3 knockout mice and IL-7 knockout mice. The phosphorylated alpha chain serves as the site for recruiting other signaling molecules to the complex to be phosphorylated and activated",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",
  "Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2 / TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP) / TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) / TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to",

  "Exposure to divalent cadmium ions (Cd2 +) is a known cancer risk factor, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inappropriate induction of cellular proliferation by cadmium are still being figured out. One cellular model used to study this process is macrophages grown in culture. In cultured macrophages, cadmium acts both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm to induce proliferation. At the cell surface, cadmium interacts with a pertussis-sensitive cell surface receptor, probably a Gi-coupled GPCR, to stimulate proliferation. Cadmium can enter cells through calcium ion channels and once in cells affects calcium release by the ER. In addition to changes in intracellular calcium, the proliferative effects of cadmium are mediated by the Ras / Map kinase pathway, and also NF-kB. Inhibition of phospholipase C, map kinases, or NF-kB with a variety of pharmacological inhibitors all blocked the activation of cellular proliferation by cadmium. Protein kinase C is also activated by cadmium, upstream of the Map kinase pathway. Changes in transcription induced by cadmium include induction of immediate early genes like fos, jun, and myc. In addition to inducing cellular proliferation, cadmium also is slightly genotoxic",
  "Corepressors are coregulators that interact with transcriptional silencers in a variety of pathways such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Abnormal corepressor-silencer interactions have been implicated in a variety of human disease pathways including several types of leukemia. The regulation of the SMRT corepressor via the p38 and Mek-1 Kinase pathway is shown in this diagram. The EFG receptor represents one mechanism by which SMRT function is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. The MEKK1 and p38 pathways are activated by EGF resulting in cross-regulation of SMRT. The induction of SMRT phosphorylation by each pathway is shown, causing SMRT to unbind from the transcription factor complexes represented by RXR, RAR, T3R and PLZF.",
  "Several different cell types coordinate their efforts as part of the immune system, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. Each of these cell types has a distinct role in the immune system, and communicates with other immune cells using secreted factors called cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, and the interferons. Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and are antigen-presenting cells, using cytokines to stimulate specific antigen dependent responses by B and T cells and non-specific responses by other cell types. T cells secrete a variety of factors to coordinate and stimulate immune responses to specific antigen, such as the role of helper T cells in B cell activation in response to antigen. The proliferation and activation of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils respond to cytokines as well. Cytokine communication is often local, within a tissue or between cells in close proximity. Each of the cytokines is secreted by one set of cells and provokes a response in another target set of cells, often including the cell that secretes the cytokine. Some cytokines, like IL-1, interferons and TNF, stimulate a broad inflammatory response in response to infection or injury.",
  "Wnt family members are secreted glycoproteins who bind to cell surface receptors such as Frizzled. Wnt members can play a role in the expression of many genes by interacting with multiple disparate signaling pathways. Shown is the Wnt / beta-catenin pathway.",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specifically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.",
  "CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor in the GPCR gene family, and is expressed by cells in the immune system and the central nervous system. In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role",
  "The glycolytic pathway begins with the simple sugar glucose and leads to pyruvate and eventually the Kreb's cycle. Dietary carbohydrates include a variety of sugars that are funneled into glycolysis to supply energy, including other monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides like starch. Fructose is an abundant monosaccharide in fruit, and is also found along with glucose in the common disaccharide sucrose. Fructose enters glycolysis by different pathways in the liver and muscle. In muscle, fructose is a substrate of hexokinase, like glucose, and enters the pathway directly as fructose 6-phosphate. In liver, hexokinase is present in very low levels and fructose passes through a more complex pathway. Fructose is first phosphorylated to form fructose 1-phosphate, which is then split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to enter glycolysis as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The sugar mannose also enters glycolysis at this point, first being converted to mannose 6-phosphate that is then isomerized to produce fructose 6-phosphate. Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk, and is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose only differs from glucose in its stereochemistry at one position, but",
  "Myocardial infraction (MI) is the condition of irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle that results from prolonged ischemia. Nearly 1.5 million people in US sustain an MI each year, and this event proves fatal in approximately one third of patients. Approximately 90% of MI result from formation of an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The thrombus transforms a region of plaque narrowing to one of complete vessel occlusion (top right in pink). The responsible thrombus appears to be generated by interactions between the atherosclerotic plaque, the coronary endothelium, circulating platelets, and dynamic vasomotor tone of the vessel wall, all of which overwhelm natural protective mechanisms. The endogenous protective mechanisms against thrombosis include: 1. Inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III (ATIII), the effectiveness of which is enhanced by binding of ATIII to heparin sulafate. The antithrombin binding region of commercial heparin consists of sulfated disaccharide units (bottom panel). 2. Inactivation of clotting factors Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (protein C *), an action that is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombomodulin (TM)",
  "The eukaryotic cell contains compartments with distinct functions bounded by lipid bilayer membranes. The movement of membrane vesicles between these compartments allows proteins in the secretory pathway to move outward from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, trans Golgi network (TGN), secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane and to be secreted into the extracellular environment. The trafficking of membrane vesicles is also essential for endocytosis and the movement of material from the extracellular environment into the early endosome (EE), late endosome (LE) and lysosome. The movement of vesicles and their contents between these compartments and their secretion are essential for a host of cellular functions, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. The movement of membrane vesicles between all of these compartments is regulated by members of the Rab family of GTPases, part of the ras superfamily of genes, regulated through binding of GTP and hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. At least eleven yeast genes in this family have been identified as Ypts, yeast transport proteins, and over sixty mammalian Rab genes have been identified in this highly conserved gene family. The products of the Rab genes regulate specific steps in vesicle transport. Rab1",
  "Inflammation is a complex response involving many different cells and signaling molecules, including the secretion of the cytokine IL-17 by activated T cells. IL-17 secretion is restricted to specific subsets of T cells but the receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed throughout the body, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders. Fibroblasts and other cells stimulated by IL-17 are induced themselves to secrete inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). These cytokines in turn provoke a range of activities, including the stimulation of neutrophil proliferation and differentiation.",

Clustering of the GABA-A receptor chloride channel alters receptor pharmacology on the cell surface and reduced clustering of the GABA receptor is associated with anxiety. GABA-A interacts with several proteins that modulate its clustering, endocytosis, and recycling or degradation. Plic-1 is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to GABA-A receptors and causes them to accumulate at inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of GABA-A, and with microtubules, bringing receptors together in plasma microdomains. Curiously, Gephyrin appears to be a bifunctional protein, with a domain involved in molybdenum metabolism. Another protein interacting with the GABA-A receptor is GABARAP, a microtubule-associated protein. Anchoring of the GABA-A receptor to GABARAP helps to cluster the receptor at the synaptic termini and to mediate fast synaptic transmission. GABARAP may mediate interaction of gephyrin with the GABA-A receptor and gephyrin may stabilize clusters by forming multimeric structures. GABARAP and gephyrin may play more",
  "Initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is a highly conserved, multi-step process (replication licensing) designed to restrict initiation events to once per replication origin per S phase. Its control has been uncovered by the discovery of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) as master regulators of the cell cycle and the initiator proteins of DNA replication, such as the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 / 18, Cdt1 and the mini-chromosome maintenance complex (Mcm). The proteins and the sequence of events involved in this process are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. First, the ORC comprised of six proteins binds to replication origins in the chromosomal DNA. At the end of mitosis, ORC, Cdc6 / 18 and Cdt1 assist the binding of Mcm proteins 27 to chromatin, and chromatin becomes licensed for replication. The activated Mcm complex functions as a replicating helicase and moves along with the replication fork to bring the origins to the unlicensed state. The cycling of CDK activity in the cell cycle regulates the two states of replication origins, the licensed state in G1-phase and the unlicensed state for the rest of the",
  "Several different cell types coordinate their efforts as part of the immune system, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. Each of these cell types has a distinct role in the immune system, and communicates with other immune cells using secreted factors called cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, and the interferons. Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and are antigen-presenting cells, using cytokines to stimulate specific antigen dependent responses by B and T cells and non-specific responses by other cell types. T cells secrete a variety of factors to coordinate and stimulate immune responses to specific antigen, such as the role of helper T cells in B cell activation in response to antigen. The proliferation and activation of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils respond to cytokines as well. Cytokine communication is often local, within a tissue or between cells in close proximity. Each of the cytokines is secreted by one set of cells and provokes a response in another target set of cells, often including the cell that secretes the cytokine. Some cytokines, like IL-1, interferons and TNF, stimulate a broad inflammatory response in response to infection or injury.",
  "Five distinct stages have been proposed in the evolution of melanoma on the basis of histological criteria: common acquired and congenital nevi without dysplastic changes; dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia; radial-growth phase (RGP) melanoma; vertical-growth phase (VGP) melanoma; and metastatic melanoma. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Moreover, melanoma development is strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways. The vertical-growth phase and metastatic melanoma are notable for striking changes in the control of cell adhesion. Recently, amplification of the MITF gene was demonstrated in 10% of primary melanomas and 20% of metastatic melanomas, suggesting that MITF is a melanoma oncogene.",
  "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide induces cellular proliferation through the EGF receptor, which has a tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain involved in EGF binding and receptor dimerization. Inhibitors of the EGF receptor are being pursued as potential cancer therapies and EGF may stimulate wound healing. Mutation of the EGF receptor has been associated with cancer in humans. The proliferative effects of EGF are signaled through several pathways. Binding of EGF results in EGF receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. The EGF receptor activates ras and the MAP kinase pathway, ultimately causing phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Fos to create AP-1 and ELK-1 that contribute to proliferation. Activation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 transcription factors by JAK kinases in response to EGF contributes to proliferative signaling. Phosphatidylinositol signaling and calcium release induced by EGF activate protein kinase C, another component of EGF signaling. Crosstalk of EGF signaling with other pathways make the EGF receptor a junction point between signaling systems.",
  "Mammalian cell motility requires actin polymerization in the direction of movement to change membrane shape and extend cytoplasm into lamellipodia. The polymerization of actin to drive cell movement also involves branching of actin filaments into a network oriented with the growing ends of the fibers near the cell membrane. Manipulation of this process helps bacteria like Salmonella gain entry into cells they infect. Two of the proteins involved in the formation of Y branches and in cell motility are Arp2 and Arp3, both members of a large multiprotein complex containing several other polypeptides as well. The Arp2 / 3 complex is localized at the Y branch junction and induces actin polymerization. Activity of this complex is regulated by multiple different cell surface receptor signaling systems, activating WASP, and Arp2 / 3 in turn to cause changes in cell shape and cell motility. Wasp and its cousin Wave-1 interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex through the p21 component of the complex. The crystal structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex has revealed further insights into the nature of how the complex works. Activation by Wave-1, another member of the WASP family, also induces actin alterations in response to Rac1",
  "Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. This classification has also been justified at the molecular level with Type 1 tumours being more commonly associated with abnormalities of DNA-mismatch repair genes, K-ras, PTEN and beta-catenin, and Type 2 tumours with abnormalities of p53 and HER2 / neu.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a broad range of cellular and physiological responses. In addition to playing a role in inflammation and hematopoiesis, IL-6 is involved in other processes such as neuronal differentiation and bone loss. To produce these effects IL-6 signals through a receptor composed of two different subunits, an alpha subunit that produces ligand specificity and gp130, a receptor subunit shared in common with other cytokines in the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT3, that move into the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing STAT3 response elements. The ras-mediated pathway, acting through Shc, Grb-2 and Sos-1 upstream and activating Map kinases downstream, activates transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-IL-6 (C / EBP-beta) that can act through their own cognate response elements in the genome. These factors and other transcription factors like AP-1 and SRF (",
  "The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway is one of a handful of pleiotropic cascades used to transduce a multitude of signals for development and homeostasis in animals, from humans to flies. In mammals, the JAK / STAT pathway is the principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, STATs are activated by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. In addition to the activation of STATs, JAKs mediate the recruitment of other molecules such as the MAP kinases, PI3 kinase etc. These molecules process downstream signals via the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways which results in the activation of additional transcription factors.",
  "Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) plays a critical role in cellular proliferation and development. The biologically active form is a dimer formed from the A and B chains. PDGF is active to a differing degree depending on which dimer is formed (AA, AB, or BB). The PDGF Receptor (PDGFR) is also a dimer and can form from the combination of the alpha and beta chains in any order (alpha-alpha, alpha-beta, beta-beta). The PDGFR dimer is only formed after ligand binding so the alpha / beta composition of the receptor can be influenced by the form of PDGF that is present. Upon binding of ligand the PDGFR is tyrosine phosphorylated and leads to the phosphorylation of several other cellular proteins.",
  "Integrins are cell surface receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix and mediate intracellular signals in response to the extracellular matrix including cellular shape, mobility, and progression through the cell cycle. Integrins do not themselves possess a kinase domain or enzymatic activity but rely on association with other signaling molecules to transmit signals. Interactions between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton commonly take place at focal adhesions on the cell surface that contain localized concentrations of integrins, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal elements. Talin forms a direct interaction with the integrin cytoplasmic domain, and interacts with cytoskeletal elements (actin) and signaling factors. Paxillin and CAS also localize in focal adhesions and may serve as a scaffold for other integrin signaling components like FAK and src. Interaction of FAK, CAS and src may be required for integrin regulation of cell cycle progression. The CrkL adaptor protein may regulate downstream integrin signaling. Growth factor signaling pathways and the caveolin receptor exhibit important cross talk with integrin receptors in cellular responses like activation of map kinase, proliferation and motility.",
  "The CD40 receptor was first associated with expression in B cells and the role it plays through its ligand CD40L (CD154) in moderating T cell activation. Broader expression may indicate a broader role for CD40 and CD40L in immune function and disease states such as transplant rejection and HIV infection. Disruption of CD40 interaction with CD40L may prove therapeutic in the treatment of autoimmune disorders or heart disease and modulation of the interaction may in the future be exploited in cancer treatment. As a member of the TNF receptor family, CD40 relies on interaction with TRAF proteins to mediate an intracellular signal in response to CD40L binding. The pathway downstream of TRAFs activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through a kinase pathway involving map kinases, NIK (NF-kappaB inducing kinase) and I-kappa B kinases. Some CD40 responses like regulation of immunoglobulin expression might be mediated by NF-kappaB transcriptional activation.",
  "IL-7 is a key cytokine in the immune system, essential for normal development of B cells and T cells. Mice with the IL-7 receptor deleted lack B and T cells. Some humans with SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency disease) also have mutation of their IL-7 receptor gene leading to an absence of T cells and greatly impaired B cell production. The IL-7 receptor includes two polypeptides, a gamma chain and an alpha chain. The alpha-chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor while several other cytokines use the same gamma receptor chain as IL-7, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. Binding of IL-7 to the alpha chain leads to dimerization of the alpha and gamma chains. JAK3 associated with the gamma chain tyrosine phosphorylates the alpha chain after dimerization. The importance of JAK3 in IL-7 signaling is supported by the similarity of the immune defects in JAK3 knockout mice and IL-7 knockout mice. The phosphorylated alpha chain serves as the site for recruiting other signaling molecules to the complex to be phosphorylated and activated",
  "D4-GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) is a negative regulator of the ras related Rho Family of GTPases. Since the rho GTPases promote cytoskeletal and membrane changes associated with apoptotic cell death, the removal of the D4-GDI block through its cleavage is important for inducing apoptosis. Caspase-3 cleaves the 28 kDa mature form of D4-GDI to give a 5 kDa and 23 kDa Size fragment. The 23 kDa fragment then translocates to the nucleus. The mechanisms involving cleavage of D4-GDI with apoptosis are not presently known. Activation of the Jun N-Terminal kinase, a regulator of apoptosis, may be one of the mechanisms.",
  "Inflammation has several distinct components, including the localized response at the site of tissue injury or infection. Tissue injury stimulates the release of inflammatory signaling molecules such as bradykinin. Bacterial infection stimulates an immune response in several ways. Bacteria that are phagocytosed can activate macrophages, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. Bacteria can also activate the complement cascade through either the antibody-mediated pathway (classical pathway) or the alternative complement pathway. In extravascular tissues, cells that respond to infection or injury include macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages and other immune cells secrete chemokines that recruit leukocytes from the circulation to the site of inflammation. Mast cells release histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes that act as chemokines, increase vascular permeability, and act on the vascular endothelium to increase tissue recruitment of leukocytes. Chemokines can recruit leukocytes or lymphocytes out of the blood stream into tissues and make blood vessels more permeable. Leukocytes are activated by inflammatory signals to express adhesion molecules that cause them to interact with the vascular endothelium, penetrate the endothelial wall and migrate into the extracellular space of tissues. The combined response of immune",
  "The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) encodes a protein kinase that acts as a tumor suppressor. ATM activation by ionizing radiation damage to DNA stimulates DNA repair and blocks progression through the cell cycle. Mutation of the ATM gene causes the disease ataxia telangiectasia which which involves an inherited predisposition to some cancers. To play this role ATM interacts with a broad network of proteins, including checkpoint factors (chk1, chk2), tumor suppressors (p53 and BRCA), DNA repair factors (RAD50, RAD51, GADD45), and other signaling molecules (c-Abl and NF-kB). In addition to regulating DNA repair and the cell cycle, ATM can also trigger apoptosis in radiation treated cells.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a) is a tissue-specific coactivator that enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors and coordinates transcriptional programs important for energy metabolism and energy homeostasis. Inappropriate increases in PGC-1a activity have been linked to a number of pathological conditions including heart failure and diabetes. PGC-1a is highly expressed in metabolically active tissues including brown fat, skeletal muscle and heart. PGC-1a has been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart and increased mitochondrial respiration in brown fat. PGC-1a is a coactivator for many factors including, CBP, Scr-1, PPARa, GR (glucocorticoid receptor), THR (thyroid hormone receptor), several orphan receptors and MEF2. This pathway illustrates two of the cofactor regulatory factors MEF2 and PPARa) and an example orphan receptor feedback inhibition loop. Glut4 is used as an example of the downstream elements leading to changes in metabolism. Ichida et al discovered the ERRa repression of PGC-1a. Their results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional control wherein ERR-a can function as a specific molecular repressor of PGC-",
  "Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor, which binds to a serum response element (SRE) associated with a variety of genes including (i) immediate early genes such as c-fos, fosB, junB, egr-1 and -2, (ii) neuronal genes such as nurr1 and nur77, and (iii) muscle genes such as actins and myosins. By regulating expression of these genes, SRF controls cell growth and differentiation, neuronal transmission as well as muscle development and function. SRF can be activated by serum, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), agents that increase intracellular Ca2 +, T-cell virus1 activator protein, hepatitis B virus activator proteins pX, activated oncogenes and protooncogenes and extracellular stimuli such as antioxidant and UV light. In serum-starved cells, MAL is predominantly cytoplasmic where it is sequestered by actin monomers. Upon serum stimulation, Rho becomes active and, through its interaction with ROCK and",
  "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is associated with gamma secretase activity that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin-1 is also a component in gamma-secretase activity involved in signaling by the transmembrane protein Notch. Active gamma secretase requires PS-1 N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment and is unique in catalyzing proteolysis within the transmembrane region of proteins. Other proteins such as nicastrin may also be components of the gamma-secretase. Binding of the ligand Delta by Notch appears to trigger two proteolytic cleavages of Notch. The first step cleaves an extracellular domain and is catalyzed by a metalloprotease termed alpha-secretase or TACE. The second cleavage step appears to occur within the transmembrane domain of Notch, and releases a Notch intracellular doman (NICD). Once released, NICD moves into the nucleus where it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CSL family transcription factors (CBF1, Su (H), Lag-1) or other transcriptional regulators such as LEF-1. Presenilin is also involved in the Wnt / frizzled signaling pathway through beta-",
  "TNFR1 (a.k.a. p55, CD120a) is the receptor for TNF (alpha) and also will bind TNF (beta). Upon binding TNF (alpha) a TNFR1 + cell is triggered to undergo apoptosis. This critical regulatory process is accomplished by activating the proteolytic caspase cascade that results in the degradation of many critical cellular proteins.",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged / Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc) -co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.",
  "Over 1,000 papers and reviews have been written about the role of ceramide in the production of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Ceramide is a sphingosine-based lipid-signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This diagram represents some of the current understanding of the cascades that couple ceramide to specific signaling pathways. These cascades illustrate that ceramide can be a growth stimulus or proapototic signal. The ultimate ceramide action is determined within the context of other stimuli and by the subcellular topology of its production and is cell-type specific. There are 2 forms of sphingomyelinase, acid (acid-sphingomyelinase: A-SMase) and neutral (neutral-sphingomyelinase N-SMase), that can produce ceramide. TNF-alpha can stimulate either form of sphingomyelinase as can other death receptors. Different domanis of TNF-alpha stimulate the different Smases. N-SMase stimulation is enhanced by the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1). The activity of each form is dependent on the local intracellular pH. In the illustration the forms are seperated to reduce confusion however",

  "Signaling by interferon-gamma stimulates anti-viral responses and tumor suppression through the heterodimeric interferon-gamma receptor. Signaling is initiated by binding of interferon-gamma to its receptor, activating the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate STAT transcription factors that activate interferon responsive genes. Molecular chaperones that modulate or alter protein folding interact with different components of the interferon signaling pathway. One chaperone that modulates interferon signaling is hTid-1, a member of the DnaJ family of chaperones and a cochaperone for the heat shock protein Hsp70, another molecular chaperone. hTid-1 was found in a two-hybrid screen to bind to JAK2 and also to interact with the interferon-gamma receptor. In addition, hTid-1 and JAK2 also interact with Hsp70. Overexpression of hTid-1 represses transcriptional activation by interferon-gamma and Hsp70 dissociates from these proteins when interferon is added to cells, suggesting that Hsp70 holds Jak2 in an inactive conformation prior to ligand activation, and is released in the presence of agonist to allow the activation of Jak-2 and downstream pathway",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates",
  "Primary immunodeficiencies (PIs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which affect cellular and humoral immunity or non-specific host defense mechanisms mediated by complement proteins, and cells such as phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. These disorders of the immune system cause increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy. Most of PIs are due to genetic defects that affect cell maturation or function at different levels during hematopoiesis. Disruption of the cellular immunity is observed in patients with defects in T cells or both T and B cells. These cellular immunodeficiencies comprise 20% of all PIs. Disorders of humoral immunity affect B-cell differentiation and antibody production. They account for 70% of all PIs.",
  "The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer",
  "The molecular events that lead to the perception of pain are a key research field in medicine and drug discovery. The opioid receptors modulate pain signaling in response to endogenous peptide ligands and opiate drugs such as morphine. The kappa opioid receptor plays a key role in the profound analgesia of opiates and is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand dynorphin, encoded by the prodynorphin gene. Production of prodynorphin is transcriptionally regulated by a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the prodynorphin gene. A transcription factor called DREAM (DRE antagonistic modulator) binds to the DRE and represses prodynorphin transcription when bound. DREAM binds calcium with 4 EF-hand motifs and the binding of DREAM to DNA is repressed in the presence of calcium. Many transcription factors are regulated by calcium indirectly through calcium sensitive kinases and phosphatases, but DREAM is unique to date in being a transcription factor that directly binds calcium and is regulated by calcium binding. DREAM may also regulate other genes such as c-fos. DREAM is expressed in spinal cord neurons in regions involved in pain signaling. The regulation of prodynorphin expression by DREAM also leads to the hypothesis that DREAM is involved in pain signaling",
  "Ca2 + that enters the cell from the outside is a principal source of signal Ca2 +. Entry of Ca2 + is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2 + by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2 + fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2 + -entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs). The other principal source of Ca2 + for signalling is the internal stores that are located primarily in the endoplasmic / sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER / SR), in which inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RYRs) regulate the release of Ca2 +. The principal activator of these channels is Ca2 + itself and this process",
  "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine that can lead to cellular activation and proliferation. IL-2 Receptors are found on activated B-Cells, LPS treated Monocytes, and many T cells.

  "Nitric oxide (NO) has a number of important physiological actions in the cardiovascular system. In the heart, NO plays role in keeping the vessels patent via vasodilation and prevention of platelet aggregation. It also plays an important role in regulating the force and rate of contraction. In vivo NO is released by shear stress of ligands that increase intracellular Ca2 + in endothelial cells. The increase intracellular Ca2 + activates nitric oxide synthase III (NOSIII) by promoting the binding of Ca / Calmodulin to the enzyme. NOSIII, which is resident in the Golgi complex, is transported together with caveolin-1 to the caveolae at the plasma membrane via vesicles. Shear stress signals via a potassium channel and the cytoskeleton, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequently in activation of Akt kinase. Akt activation by shear stress but also by VEGF activates NOSIII by serine phosphorylation, which increases the affinity of NOSIII for calmodulin. After agonist binding at the plasma membrane, NOSIII-activating receptors translocate to caveolae. VEGF receptor signals via its tyrosine kinase domain. Furthermore, agonist",
  "T cell activation is initiated by recognition of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of Class II MHC on an antigen-presenting cell. The T cell receptor contains multiple subunits and interacts with several factors to transduce antigen-stimulated T cell activation. One of the key steps that initiates receptor activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR subunits by the src family protein kinases Lck and Fyn. T cell receptor phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn recruits the ZAP-70 protein kinase to the receptor complex, which becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways like the Map kinase cascade. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase activates Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating these proteins and is required for TCR activation. Association of the CD4 coreceptor with Lck may also be involved in Lck activation.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is one of a family of neurotrophins that induce the survival and proliferation of neurons. In cell culture NGF induces the formation of neurite projections and in vivo may stimulate the innervation of tissues. NGF plays a role in the repair, regeneration, and protection of neurons, and as such could serve as a therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. One potential method of NGF application would be through gene therapy or through implantation of cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo. NGF has also been suggested to play a role in other physiological systems and tissues such as the immune system. NGF has two receptors, TrkA and the p75 (NTR). NGF may signal its neuroprotective actions through the tyrosine kinase TrkA receptor and trigger apoptosis in some cells through the p75 receptor. High-affinity binding of NGF requires both TrkA and p75 (NTR). Binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor causes activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream signaling cascades. One of the downstream signaling pathways of NGF activates phospholipase C, releasing DAG and IP3 and activating associated downstream pathways such as protein kinase",
  "Xenopus oocytes are naturally arrested at G2 of meiosis I. Exposure to either insulin / IGF-1 or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks this arrest and induces resumption of the two meiotic division cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg. This process is termed oocyte maturation. The transition is accompanied by an increase in maturation promoting factor (MPF or Cdc2 / cyclin B) which precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Most reports point towards the Mos-MEK1-ERK2 pathway and the polo-like kinase / CDC25 pathway as responsible for the activation of MPF in meiosis, most likely triggered by a decrease in cAMP.",

  "Significant progress has been made towards delineation of the intrinsic molecular processes that regulate B lymphocyte immune function. Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of",

In addition to regulating DNA repair and the cell cycle, ATM can also trigger apoptosis in radiation treated cells.",
  "The classification of autoimmune throid disease (AITD) includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and its variants, Graves' disease (GD) and autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis or primary myxedema. HT is characterized by the presence of goitre, thyroid autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in serum and varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. During HT, self-reactive CD4 + T lymphocytes (Th) recruit B cells and CD8 + T cells (CTL) into the thyroid. Disease progression leads to the death of thyroid cells and hypothyroidism. Both autoantibodies and thyroid-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been proposed to be responsible for autoimmune thyrocyte depletion. In GD, the TSH-R is the most important autoantigen. Antibodies directed against it mimic the effects of the hormone on thyroid cells, TSH, stimulating autonomous production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine and causing hyperthyroidism. The presence of TSH-R-blocking antibodies that bind the TSH receptor in a similar fashion to the antibodies in patients with Graves' disease but that block rather than activate the receptor explains some cases of atrophic hypothyroidism.",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved biological pathway that plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations from becoming permanent in dividing cells. MMR also suppresses homologous recombination and was recently shown to play a role in DNA damage signaling. Defects in MMR are associated with genome-wide instability, predisposition to certain types of cancer including HNPCC, resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, and abnormalities in meiosis and sterility in mammalian systems. The Escherichia coli MMR pathway has been extensively studied and is well characterized. In E. coli, the mismatch-activated MutS-MutL-ATP complex licenses MutH to incise the nearest unmethylated GATC sequence. UvrD and an exonuclease generate a gap. This gap is filled by pol III and DNA ligase. The GATC sites are then methylated by Dam. Several human MMR proteins have been identified based on their homology to E. coli MMR proteins. These include human homologs of MutS and MutL. Although E. coli MutS and MutL proteins are homodimers, human MutS and MutL homologs are heterodimers. The role of hemim",
  "Cell adhesion molecules are (glyco) proteins expressed on the cell surface and play a critical role in a wide array of biologic processes that include hemostasis, the immune response, inflammation, embryogenesis, and development of neuronal tissue. There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. Membrane proteins that mediate immune cellcell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions are important for brain morphology and highly coordinated brain functions such as memory and learning. During early development of the nervous system, neurons elongate their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of cell-cell adhesions. Cell-cell adhesions also underpin axon-axon contacts and link neurons with supporting schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.",
  "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide induces cellular proliferation through the EGF receptor, which has a tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain involved in EGF binding and receptor dimerization. Inhibitors of the EGF receptor are being pursued as potential cancer therapies and EGF may stimulate wound healing. Mutation of the EGF receptor has been associated with cancer in humans. The proliferative effects of EGF are signaled through several pathways. Binding of EGF results in EGF receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. The EGF receptor activates ras and the MAP kinase pathway, ultimately causing phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Fos to create AP-1 and ELK-1 that contribute to proliferation. Activation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 transcription factors by JAK kinases in response to EGF contributes to proliferative signaling. Phosphatidylinositol signaling and calcium release induced by EGF activate protein kinase C, another component of EGF signaling. Crosstalk of EGF signaling with other pathways make the EGF receptor a junction point between signaling systems.",
  "The CD40 receptor was first associated with expression in B cells and the role it plays through its ligand CD40L (CD154) in moderating T cell activation. Broader expression may indicate a broader role for CD40 and CD40L in immune function and disease states such as transplant rejection and HIV infection. Disruption of CD40 interaction with CD40L may prove therapeutic in the treatment of autoimmune disorders or heart disease and modulation of the interaction may in the future be exploited in cancer treatment. As a member of the TNF receptor family, CD40 relies on interaction with TRAF proteins to mediate an intracellular signal in response to CD40L binding. The pathway downstream of TRAFs activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through a kinase pathway involving map kinases, NIK (NF-kappaB inducing kinase) and I-kappa B kinases. Some CD40 responses like regulation of immunoglobulin expression might be mediated by NF-kappaB transcriptional activation.",
  "Eenteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are closely related pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. The hallmark of EPEC / EHEC infections is induction of attaching and effacing (A / E) lesions that damage intestinal epithelial cells. The capacity to form A / E lesions is encoded mainly by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Tir, Map, EspF, EspG are known LEE-encoded effector proteins secreted via the type III secretion system, which is also LEE-encoded, into the host cell. EPEC and EHEC Tir's link the extracellular bacterium to the cell cytoskeleton. Map and EspF are involved in mitochondrion membrane permeabilization. EspG interacts with tubulins and stimulates microtubule destabilization. LEE-encoded adhesin or intimin (Eae) is exported via the general secretory pathway to the periplasm, where it is inserted into the outer membrane. In addition to Tir, two potential host cell-carried intimin receptors, beta1 integrin (ITGB1) and nucleolin (NCL), have so far been identified. The",
  "Myocarditis is a cardiac disease associated with inflammation and injury of the myocardium. It results from various etiologies, both noninfectious and infectious, but coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is still considered the dominant etiological agent. Myocarditis may be caused by direct cytopathic effects of virus, a pathologic immune response to persistent virus, or autoimmunity triggered by the viral infection. The virus enters the myocyte through internalization of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) and its coreceptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Viral proteases cleave various proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to apoptosis. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells. CVB",
  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1 (a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1), parkin, DJ1 (a parkin-associated protein involved with oxidative stress), and PINK1 (a putative serine threonine kinase) are known to cause early-onset PD. Mutations or altered expression of these proteins contributes to PD pathogenesis through common mechanisms that result in proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress. Point mutations in alpha-synuclein and the recently described Iowan functional duplication of alpha-synuclein lead to excessive intracellular accumulation and protofibril formation. Decrease in the amount of soluble alpha-synuclein tends to increase free cytoplasmic dopamine and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, formation of protofibrils or aggregates and Lewy bodies (LBs) diminishes the availability of the physiological forms of alpha-synuclein, favoring an increase in TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) and DAT (dopamine transporter), but diminishes vesicles formation and neuronal plasticity. Modification of parkin and UCHL1 are associated with the",
  "Contraction of the heart is a complex process initiated by the electrical excitation of cardiac myocytes (excitation-contraction coupling, ECC). In cardiac myocytes, Ca2 + influx induced by activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (DHP receptors) upon membrane depolarization triggers the release of Ca2 + via Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through a Ca2 + -induced Ca release (CICR) mechanism. Ca2 + ions released via the CICR mechanism diffuse through the cytosolic space to contractile proteins to bind to troponinC resulting in the release of inhibition induced by troponinI. The Ca2 + binding to troponinC thereby triggers the sliding of thin and thick filaments, that is, the activation of a crossbridge and subsequent cardiac force development and / or cell shortening. Recovery occurs as Ca2 + is pumped out of the cell by the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) or is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by sarco (endo) plasmic Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) pumps on the non-junctional region of the SR.",
  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs triggers the assembly of a MAP kinase activation complex using -arrestin as a scaffold, with subsequent activation of a -arrestin-bound pool of ERK1 / 2. The receptor-arrestinERK complexes are localized to endosomal vesicles, and their formation does not result in nuclear translocation of activated ERK1 / 2 or stimulation of cell proliferation. The function of -arrestin-bound ERK1 / 2 is presently unknown. Activation of ERK1 / 2 by -arrestin scaffolds may favor the phosphorylation of plasma membrane, cytosolic, or cytoskeletal ERK1 / 2 substrates, or it may lead to transcriptional activation through the ERK-dependent activation of other kinases. The model depicts -arrestin scaffolding of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade, based upon data obtained with the protease-activated PAR2 and angiotensin AT1a receptors. A similar mechanism has been proposed for regulation of the JNK3 MAP kinase cascade by AT1a receptors.",
  "There is now much evidence that VEGFR-2 is the major mediator of VEGF-driven responses in endothelial cells and it is considered to be a crucial signal transducer in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to a cascade of different signaling pathways, resulting in the up-regulation of genes involved in mediating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and promoting their survival and vascular permeability. For example, the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to dimerization of the receptor, followed by intracellular activation of the PLCgamma; PKC-Raf kinase-MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth, whereas activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway leads to increased endothelial-cell survival. Activation of PI3K, FAK, and p38 MAPK is implicated in cell migration signaling.",
  "Cholera toxin (CTX) is one of the main virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae. Once secreted, CTX B-chain (CTXB) binds to ganglioside GM1 on the surface of the host's cells. After binding takes place, the entire CTX complex is carried from plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the A-chain (CTXA) is recognized by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), unfolded, and delivered to the membrane where the membrane-associated ER-oxidase, Ero1, oxidizes PDI to release the CTXA into the protein-conducting channel, Sec61. CTXA is then retro-translocated to the cytosol and induces water and electrolyte secretion by increasing cAMP levels via adenylate cyclase (AC) to exert toxicity. Other than CTX, Vibrio cholerae generates several toxins that are perilous to eukaryotic cells. Zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) causes tight junction disruption through protein kinase C-dependent actin polymerization. RTX toxin (RtxA) causes actin depolymerization by covalently cross-linking actin monomers into dimers, trimers, and higher multimers. Vibrio",

  "One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin proteins form pores in the membranes of the attacked cell, allowing the entry of Granzyme A and Granzyme B. Granzyme B induces caspase activation and cleavage of factors like ICAD, releasing DFF40 to fragment DNA, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Granzyme A is also an abundant granzyme released by cytotoxic T cells and is important in cytotoxic T cell induced apoptosis, activating caspase independent pathways. Once in a cell, Granzyme A activates DNA nicking by the recently identified DNAse NM23-H1, a tumor suppressor gene product whose expression is reduced in transformed, metastatic cells. The previous identification of NM23-H1 as a tumor suppressor indicates that its DNAse activity plays an important role in immune surveillance to prevent cancer through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of NM23-H1 occurs indirectly, through the cleavage of proteins that inhibit NM23-H1 in the SET complex, which includes SET, Ape1, pp32 and",
  "TACI and BCMA signal transduction pathway that enhances cell survival APRIL and BAFF (also called TALL-I and BLyS) are TNF family members that act as ligands for the BCMA and TACI receptors. Both APRIL and BAFF bind to both the BCMA and TACI receptors to activate the humoral immune response, stimulating B cell immunoglobulin production and proliferation. BAFF is found as a membrane bound form in T cells and a soluble form that is released from the cell to stimulate B cell proliferation and differentiation. As members of the TNF receptor gene family, BCMA and TACI interact with TRAF family members to transduce signals downstream to NF-kappaB activation and MAP kinase pathways. Abnormally active BAFF or APRIL signaling may play a role in autoimmune disorders such as lupus.",
  "Primary immunodeficiencies (PIs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, which affect cellular and humoral immunity or non-specific host defense mechanisms mediated by complement proteins, and cells such as phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. These disorders of the immune system cause increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy. Most of PIs are due to genetic defects that affect cell maturation or function at different levels during hematopoiesis. Disruption of the cellular immunity is observed in patients with defects in T cells or both T and B cells. These cellular immunodeficiencies comprise 20% of all PIs. Disorders of humoral immunity affect B-cell differentiation and antibody production. They account for 70% of all PIs.",
  "T helper cells play an essential role coordinating the activities of other parts of the immune system, including B cells, cytotoxic T cells, macrophages and other cells. The crucial nature of helper T cells in the normal immune response is demonstrated by the severe immune deficiency associated with the HIV-induced helper T cell depletion. To communicate with other cells, helper T cells express a range of cell surface molecules, a few of which are illustrated in this figure. Like all T cells, helper T cells express T cell receptors complexed with the CD3 proteins that are responsible for the recognition and response of the cell to specific antigens. CD4 is commonly used as a marker for helper T cells, in contrast to cytotoxic T cells, which express CD8. CD4 is used by HIV to gain cell entry, as well as the CCR5 chemokine receptor. Thy1 provides a more general cell surface antigen used to identify both T helper and cytotoxic T cells. CD28 provides a costimulatory signal in association with the activation of the T cell receptor complex by an antigen presenting cell that is required for the T cell to become activated.

  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM (familial DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of familial DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an idiopathic DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of idiopathic DCM focus on chronic viral myocarditis and / or on autoimmune abnormalities. Viral myocarditis may progress to an autoimmune phase and then to progressive cardiac dilatation. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with idiopathic DCM, may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2 +, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.",
  "Type I diabetes mellitus is a disease that results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. Certain beta-cell proteins act as autoantigens after being processed by antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and presented in a complex with MHC-II molecules on the surface of the APC. Then immunogenic signals from APC activate CD4 + T cells, predominantly of the Th1 subset. Antigen-activated Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFNgamma. They activate macrophages and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, and these effector cells may kill islet beta-cells by one or both of two types of mechanisms: (1) direct interactions of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells with a beta-cell autoantigen-MHC-I complex on the beta-cell, and (2) non-specific inflammatory mediators, such as free radicals / oxidants and cytokines (IL-1, TNFalpha, TNFbeta, IFNgamma). Type I diabetes is a polygenic disease. One of the principle determining genetic factors in diabetes incidence is the inheritance of mutant MHC-II alleles. Another plausible candidate gene is the insulin gene.",

  "The chromatin packaging of the genome is dynamic, changing with the cell cycle and with transcriptional regulation. During mitosis, chromatin is condensed for segregation of chromosomes, while for transcription chromatin is more open. The nuclear matrix, or scaffold, is a protein network in the nucleus providing structure and regulating chromatin condensation. Regulated interactions of matrix proteins with each other, DNA and other factors in different phases of the cell cycle alter the structure and function of chromatin. AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein) is a nuclear matrix associated protein that also binds DNA and different proteins during different phases of the cell cycle. The interaction of AKAP95 with DNA and proteins alters the condensation and transcription of chromatin. A specific domain of AKAP95 regulates its interaction with the nuclear matrix and another regulates its association with DNA. One key protein that AKAP95 interacts with is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. AKAP95 binds to PKA through a PKA RII regulatory subunit, an interaction that requires PKA phosphorylation by Cdk1. PKA activity and cAMP are reduced during entry into mitosis, but PKA recruited by AKAP",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "Pathogenic Salmonella enter cells such as those of the intestinal epithelium by altering cellular cytoskeletal structure and inducing membrane ruffling of the infected cell. Salmonella is able to alter the cytoskeleton and membrane through the action of secreted bacterial Sip proteins, SopE, SopB, and SptP that are inserted into the cytosol of the infected cell. Sip proteins encoded by Salmonella are required for the action of SopE and for the invasion of epithelial cells. SipA stabilizes actin filaments, inducing membrane ruffling and perhaps focusing membrane changes where bacteria are localized to allow their entry. SipC produces a similar effect on actin filaments and cytoskeletal structure. SopE acts as an exchange factor on Rac1 and Cdc42, two GTPases in the Rho family that regulate actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 by Salmonella SopE induces changes in cytoskeleton structure that allow bacterial entry into the cell. SopB is another salmonella protein that acts as an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and also stimulates Cdc42 and Rac1. One of the cellular targets of both Cdc42 and Rac1 that affects actin structure is the Arp2 / 3 complex. Cdc",
  "Interleukin-3 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells through binding to its receptor.

Signaling is believed to be primarily through Stat5 and the MAPK pathways.",
  "p53 activation is induced by a number of stress signals, including DNA damage, oxidative stress and activated oncogenes. The p53 protein is employed as a transcriptional activator of p53-regulated genes. This results in three major outputs; cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence or apoptosis. Other p53-regulated gene functions communicate with adjacent cells, repair the damaged DNA or set up positive and negative feedback loops that enhance or attenuate the functions of the p53 protein and integrate these stress responses with other signal transduction pathways.",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, members of the Ras GTPase superfamily that were initially recognized and purified because of their ability to stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the cholera toxin A subunit. We now know that they are critical components of several different vesicular trafficking pathways in all eukaryotic cells and activators of specific phospholipase Ds (PLDs) (reviewed in Refs. 13). ARF interacts with many proteins and other molecules that regulate its state of activation or are involved in its intracellular function. Arf proteins cycle between GDP-bound, inactive and GTP-bound, active forms, and the cycling is regulated by specific GEPs and GAPs. Members of the Arf GEP family can be grouped into two major subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities and functional differences. The high-molecular-weight Arf GEP subfamily includes yeast Sec7, Gea1, and Gea2, and mammalian BIG1 / p200, BIG2, and GBF1, which all consist of 1,400 2,000 amino acid residues. Many Arf",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a) is a tissue-specific coactivator that enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors and coordinates transcriptional programs important for energy metabolism and energy homeostasis. Inappropriate increases in PGC-1a activity have been linked to a number of pathological conditions including heart failure and diabetes. PGC-1a is highly expressed in metabolically active tissues including brown fat, skeletal muscle and heart. PGC-1a has been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart and increased mitochondrial respiration in brown fat. PGC-1a is a coactivator for many factors including, CBP, Scr-1, PPARa, GR (glucocorticoid receptor), THR (thyroid hormone receptor), several orphan receptors and MEF2. This pathway illustrates two of the cofactor regulatory factors MEF2 and PPARa) and an example orphan receptor feedback inhibition loop. Glut4 is used as an example of the downstream elements leading to changes in metabolism. Ichida et al discovered the ERRa repression of PGC-1a. Their results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional control wherein ERR-a can function as a specific molecular repressor of PGC-",
  "The complement system is part of the defense against invading cells and is composed of about twenty different proteins found in the plasma. When activated, complement proteins form a pathway of proteolytic reactions that culminates in the lysis of foreign cells. The complement system also stimulates phagocytosis of foreign cells and an inflammatory response. There are two different complement systems, the classical complement pathway initiated by antibody complexes on the cell surface, and an alternative complement pathway that is initiated without antibodies. The complement system proteins are named with a capital C followed by a number. A small letter after the number indicates that the protein is a smaller protein resulting from the cleavage of a larger precursor by a protease. In the classical pathway, the first step is the initiation of the pathway triggered by recognition by complement factor C1 of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface. When C1 complex interacts with aggregates of IgG with antigen on a cell's surface, two C1-associated proteases, C1r and C1s, are activated. Other factors like lipopolysaccharide also activate C1s. Once C1s is activated, it cleaves C4 to form C4b that then binds to the cell",

  "The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway is one of a handful of pleiotropic cascades used to transduce a multitude of signals for development and homeostasis in animals, from humans to flies. In mammals, the JAK / STAT pathway is the principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, STATs are activated by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. In addition to the activation of STATs, JAKs mediate the recruitment of other molecules such as the MAP kinases, PI3 kinase etc. These molecules process downstream signals via the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways which results in the activation of additional transcription factors.",
  "After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",

  "The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) encodes a protein kinase that acts as a tumor suppressor. ATM activation by ionizing radiation damage to DNA stimulates DNA repair and blocks progression through the cell cycle. Mutation of the ATM gene causes the disease ataxia telangiectasia which which involves an inherited predisposition to some cancers. To play this role ATM interacts with a broad network of proteins, including checkpoint factors (chk1, chk2), tumor suppressors (p53 and BRCA), DNA repair factors (RAD50, RAD51, GADD45), and other signaling molecules (c-Abl and NF-kB). In addition to regulating DNA repair and the cell cycle, ATM can also trigger apoptosis in radiation treated cells.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.",
  "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is associated with gamma secretase activity that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin-1 is also a component in gamma-secretase activity involved in signaling by the transmembrane protein Notch. Active gamma secretase requires PS-1 N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment and is unique in catalyzing proteolysis within the transmembrane region of proteins. Other proteins such as nicastrin may also be components of the gamma-secretase. Binding of the ligand Delta by Notch appears to trigger two proteolytic cleavages of Notch. The first step cleaves an extracellular domain and is catalyzed by a metalloprotease termed alpha-secretase or TACE. The second cleavage step appears to occur within the transmembrane domain of Notch, and releases a Notch intracellular doman (NICD). Once released, NICD moves into the nucleus where it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CSL family transcription factors (CBF1, Su (H), Lag-1) or other transcriptional regulators such as LEF-1. Presenilin is also involved in the Wnt / frizzled signaling pathway through beta-",
  "Thrombin is an extracellular protease that is involved in the clotting of blood and inflammation through its action on platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature and that plays a role in thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4. PAR1 activation may be involved in the dilation of arteries during inflammation through the action of thrombin on endothelial cells and in platelet activation by thrombin during clotting. PAR1 and PAR2 activation cause bronchodilation in airway and may protect against",
  "Ca2 + that enters the cell from the outside is a principal source of signal Ca2 +. Entry of Ca2 + is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2 + by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2 + fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2 + -entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs). The other principal source of Ca2 + for signalling is the internal stores that are located primarily in the endoplasmic / sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER / SR), in which inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RYRs) regulate the release of Ca2 +. The principal activator of these channels is Ca2 + itself and this process",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.",
  "Bladder cancer arise and progress along two distinctive pathways. The first of these is often preceded by simple and papillary hyperplasia and exhibits a tumour morphology that is low-grade, superficial and papillary. Papillary carcinoma has a tendency to recur locally, but rarely invades and metastasizes. These tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. The second tumour pathway is characterized by high-grade muscle-invasive tumours, which either originate from flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) / severe dysplasia or arise de novo. Over half of these tumours show defects in the tumour suppressors p53 and / or the retinoblastoma protein (RB) genes and pathways, and over 50% of these tumours progress to local and distant metastases. Some of the cell cycle-related molecules show evidence of epigenetic modulation through aberrant promoter hypermethylation in invasive bladder cancer. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors",
  "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine that can lead to cellular activation and proliferation. IL-2 Receptors are found on activated B-Cells, LPS treated Monocytes, and many T cells. The receptor is formed from three chains alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and gamma (CD132). Primary signaling is through the JAK / Stat pathway and MAPKs.",
  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",
  "Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes. This figure represents the possible activation routes of different protein kinases involved in Cx43 and Cx36 phosphorylation.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a14) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and / or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, members of the Ras GTPase superfamily that were initially recognized and purified because of their ability to stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the cholera toxin A subunit. We now know that they are critical components of several different vesicular trafficking pathways in all eukaryotic cells and activators of specific phospholipase Ds (PLDs) (reviewed in Refs. 13). ARF interacts with many proteins and other molecules that regulate its state of activation or are involved in its intracellular function. Arf proteins cycle between GDP-bound, inactive and GTP-bound, active forms, and the cycling is regulated by specific GEPs and GAPs. Members of the Arf GEP family can be grouped into two major subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities and functional differences. The high-molecular-weight Arf GEP subfamily includes yeast Sec7, Gea1, and Gea2, and mammalian BIG1 / p200, BIG2, and GBF1, which all consist of 1,400 2,000 amino acid residues. Many Arf",
  "Exposure to divalent cadmium ions (Cd2 +) is a known cancer risk factor, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inappropriate induction of cellular proliferation by cadmium are still being figured out. One cellular model used to study this process is macrophages grown in culture. In cultured macrophages, cadmium acts both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm to induce proliferation. At the cell surface, cadmium interacts with a pertussis-sensitive cell surface receptor, probably a Gi-coupled GPCR, to stimulate proliferation. Cadmium can enter cells through calcium ion channels and once in cells affects calcium release by the ER. In addition to changes in intracellular calcium, the proliferative effects of cadmium are mediated by the Ras / Map kinase pathway, and also NF-kB. Inhibition of phospholipase C, map kinases, or NF-kB with a variety of pharmacological inhibitors all blocked the activation of cellular proliferation by cadmium. Protein kinase C is also activated by cadmium, upstream of the Map kinase pathway. Changes in transcription induced by cadmium include induction of immediate early genes like fos, jun, and myc. In addition to inducing cellular proliferation, cadmium also is slightly genotoxic",
  "CTCF is central to signaling pathways in immature B cells elicited by cross-linking the Ig BCR and stimulation with TGF. Both stimuli result in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. BCR ligation stimulates a transient induction of MYC that leads to high level CTCF expression and feedback suppression of MYC transcription. BCR ligation also activates PTEN opposing PI3K activation of MYC. Pharmacologic inactivation of PI3K or mTOR / FRAP results in suppression of S6K resulting in activation of CTCF and suppression of MYC. CTCF activation induces transcriptional activation of p19ARF, with its downstream consequences, and of p27. Growth arrest is occasioned by co-expression of p21 and p27 and inhibition of MYC. CTCF, is bona fide multivalent DNA-sequence binder which specificity is mediated by different sets of zinc fingers (ZFs). For three different DNA target sites, particular groups of ZFs which cannot be deleted from the 11 ZF domain without loosing binding to a given site, are shown by a rainbow in the box on the left.",
  "Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting viral pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Non-self RNA appearing in a cell as a result of intracellular viral replication is recognized by a family of cytosolic RNA helicases termed RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). The RLR proteins include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 and are expressed in both immune and nonimmune cells. Upon recognition of viral nucleic acids, RLRs recruit specific intracellular adaptor proteins to initiate signaling pathways that lead to the synthesis of type I interferon and other inflammatory cytokines, which are important for eliminating viruses.",
  "The Fc Epsilon Receptor 1 signaling pathway in mast cells uses multiple core signal path to achieve its necessary ends. Through the BTK protein and PKC Mast cells are able to degranulate, through the PKC and MAPK paths the cells are able to alter cytokine expression and arachidonic acid release.",
  "Physical interactions between intergrin alpha4beta1 heterodimer expressed on B cells and counter receptors on stroma cells are key mediators of the survival of normal and malignant B cells. Recent data indicate that integrin stimulation increases FBI-1, XIAP, surviving, and CCT4 expression but inhibits Requiem, c-Fos, and caspase 3 and 7 induction.",
  "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) formation is either de novo (primary GBMs) or due to the progression of a lower grade glioma to a higher grade one through the acquisition of additional mutations (secondary GBMs). In primary GBM, disruption of the p53 pathway often occurs through loss of ARF, or less frequently through amplification of MDM2. Disruption of the RB pathway occurs through loss of INK4A. Amplification and / or mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the most frequently detected genetic defect that is associated with primary GBM. In secondary GBM, loss of p53 and activation of the growth-factorreceptor-tyrosine-kinase signalling pathway (such as through overexpression of PDGF / PDGFR) initiates tumour formation, whereas disruption of the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway contributes to the progression of tumour development. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.",

  "The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway is one of a handful of pleiotropic cascades used to transduce a multitude of signals for development and homeostasis in animals, from humans to flies. In mammals, the JAK / STAT pathway is the principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, STATs are activated by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. In addition to the activation of STATs, JAKs mediate the recruitment of other molecules such as the MAP kinases, PI3 kinase etc. These molecules process downstream signals via the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways which results in the activation of additional transcription factors.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.",
  "B cells are an important component of adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete millions of different antibody molecules, each of which recognizes a different (foreign) antigen. The B cell receptor (BCR) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta. After BCR ligation by antigen, three main protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) -the SRC-family kinase LYN, SYK and the TEC-family kinase BTK- are activated. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma 2) are important downstream effectors of BCR signalling. This signalling ultimately results in the expression of immediate early genes that further activate the expression of other genes involved in B cell proliferation, differentiation and Ig production as well as other processes.",
  "Over 1,000 papers and reviews have been written about the role of ceramide in the production of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Ceramide is a sphingosine-based lipid-signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This diagram represents some of the current understanding of the cascades that couple ceramide to specific signaling pathways. These cascades illustrate that ceramide can be a growth stimulus or proapototic signal. The ultimate ceramide action is determined within the context of other stimuli and by the subcellular topology of its production and is cell-type specific. There are 2 forms of sphingomyelinase, acid (acid-sphingomyelinase: A-SMase) and neutral (neutral-sphingomyelinase N-SMase), that can produce ceramide. TNF-alpha can stimulate either form of sphingomyelinase as can other death receptors. Different domanis of TNF-alpha stimulate the different Smases. N-SMase stimulation is enhanced by the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1). The activity of each form is dependent on the local intracellular pH. In the illustration the forms are seperated to reduce confusion however",
  "Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt / Ca2 + pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2 + signalling is mediated through",
  "Many different peptides act as signaling molecules, including the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin, the protease enzyme thrombin, and the blood pressure regulating peptide angiotensin. While these three proteins are distinct in their sequence and physiology, and act through different cell surface receptors, they share in a common class of cell surface receptors called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other polypeptide ligands of GPCRs include vasopressin, oxytocin, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, GnRH, leutinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, orexins, urotensin II, endorphins, enkephalins, and many others. GPCRs are a broad and diverse gene family that respond not only to peptide ligands but also small molecule neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline), light, odorants, taste, lipids, nucleotides, and ions. The main signaling mechanism used by GPCRs is to interact with G-protein GTPase proteins coupled to downstream second messenger systems including intracellular calcium release and cAMP production. The intracellular signaling systems used by peptide GPCRs are similar to those used by all GPCRs, and are typically classified according to the G-protein they interact with and the second",
  "The activation of T cells requires a co-stimulatory signal with T cell receptor activation, provided in many cases by activation of CD28 in resting T cells. 4-1BB (CD137) is a member of the TNF receptor gene family that provides another T cell co-stimulatory signal. 4-1BB is expressed by activated cytotoxic and helper T cells and its expression is induced by a variety of T cell stimuli, including activation of the T cell receptor or stimulation with mitogens. The ligand for 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is induced on activated antigen-presenting cells including macrophages, activating T cells expressing 4-1BB. Mice lacking 4-1BB survive and have an altered though functional immune response. T cells of mice lacking 4-1BB proliferate more rapidly than normal T cells, but have reduced cytokine secretion. The costimulatory signal provided by 4-1BB may act in combination with CD28 activation to prolong the T cell response, and may also act independently of CD28. Stimulation of T cells with the 4-1BB ligand may provide a therapeutic immune response in the treatment of cancer or",
  "Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2 + signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NR2B / NR1 NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2 + handling. As a result, stimulation of glutamate receptors leads to supranormal Ca2 + responses in HD MSN and mitochondrial Ca2 + overload. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions, though they are not primarily responsible for toxicity. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference",
  "Axon guidance represents a key stage in the formation of neuronal network. Axons are guided by a variety of guidance factors, such as netrins, ephrins, Slits, and semaphorins. These guidance cues are read by growth cone receptors, and signal transduction pathways downstream of these receptors converge onto the Rho GTPases to elicit changes in cytoskeletal organization that determine which way the growth cone will turn.",
  "IL-7 is a key cytokine in the immune system, essential for normal development of B cells and T cells. Mice with the IL-7 receptor deleted lack B and T cells. Some humans with SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency disease) also have mutation of their IL-7 receptor gene leading to an absence of T cells and greatly impaired B cell production. The IL-7 receptor includes two polypeptides, a gamma chain and an alpha chain. The alpha-chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor while several other cytokines use the same gamma receptor chain as IL-7, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. Binding of IL-7 to the alpha chain leads to dimerization of the alpha and gamma chains. JAK3 associated with the gamma chain tyrosine phosphorylates the alpha chain after dimerization. The importance of JAK3 in IL-7 signaling is supported by the similarity of the immune defects in JAK3 knockout mice and IL-7 knockout mice. The phosphorylated alpha chain serves as the site for recruiting other signaling molecules to the complex to be phosphorylated and activated",
  "Glycolysis is the process of converting glucose into pyruvate and generating small amounts of ATP (energy) and NADH (reducing power). It is a central pathway that produces important precursor metabolites: six-carbon compounds of glucose-6P and fructose-6P and three-carbon compounds of glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate. Acetyl-CoA, another important precursor metabolite, is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. When the enzyme genes of this pathway are examined in completely sequenced genomes, the reaction steps of three-carbon compounds from glycerone-P to pyruvate form a conserved core module, which is found in almost all organisms and which often corresponds to operon structures in bacterial genomes. Gluconeogenesis is a synthesis pathway of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors. It is essentially a reversal of glycolysis with minor variations of alternative paths.",
  "Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor / X receptor (SXR / PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and",
  "T cell activation is initiated by recognition of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of Class II MHC on an antigen-presenting cell. The T cell receptor contains multiple subunits and interacts with several factors to transduce antigen-stimulated T cell activation. One of the key steps that initiates receptor activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR subunits by the src family protein kinases Lck and Fyn. T cell receptor phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn recruits the ZAP-70 protein kinase to the receptor complex, which becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways like the Map kinase cascade. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase activates Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating these proteins and is required for TCR activation. Association of the CD4 coreceptor with Lck may also be involved in Lck activation.",
  "Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors involved in differentiation and survival of neural cells. The neurotrophin family consists of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4). Neurotrophins exert their functions through engagement of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors or p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Neurotrophin / Trk signaling is regulated by connecting a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, which include MAPK pathway, PI-3 kinase pathway, and PLC pathway, transmitting positive signals like enhanced survival and growth. On the other hand, p75NTR transmits both positive and nagative signals. These signals play an important role for neural development and additional higher-order activities such as learning and memory.",

  "BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified genetically as breast cancer susceptibility genes when a single copy of the gene is mutated and are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, including blocking cell cycle progression and inducing DNA repair to preserve the integrity of the genome during cell division. BRCA1 and BRCA2 induce double-stranded repair of breaks using homologous recombination, in part through activation of RAD51. BRCA1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase targeting the protein FancD2 that activates checkpoint control, integrating the ATM response to ionizing radiation and the FA response to cross-linking agents like mitomycin C. Mutation of one of the several components of the FA complex involved in maintaining integrity of the genome leads to the condition Fanconi anemia. One member of the FA complex was recently identified as BRCA2, which leads to Fanconi anemia when both copies of the gene are mutated. Another related factor involved in the response of cells to DNA damage is the kinase ATM. ATM is mutated in patients with AT, a condition with many similar traits to Fanconi anemia. Like ATM, ATR serves as a checkpoint kinase that halts cell cycle progression and induces DNA repair when DNA is damaged. Loss",
  "The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes that catalyze conjunction of glutathione with harmful, electrophilic molecules, thereby protecting cells from carcinogenic factors. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by such carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. After therapeutic reduction in the levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer has been associated with mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) that permit receptor activation by other ligands, increased expression of androgen receptors accompanying AR amplification, and ligand-independent androgen-receptor activation.",
  "Map kinases transduce responses to extracellular signals by a variety of routes, and communicate with other pathways through extensive crosstalk networks. A closely studied Map kinase cascade originates with tyrosine kinase activation, and activation of Ras. Ras activates Raf, Raf activates the Map kinase kinases Mek1 and Mek2 and these kinases activate downstream Map kinases like Erk1 and Erk2. Erk1 and Erk2 in turn activate transgenes like p35 through the Map kinase activated transcription factor EGR-1. Mek1 plays a central role in many different Map kinase pathways. Factors that activate Mek1 include growth factors like NGF, cytokines, chemokines, and phorbol ester, resulting in cellular proliferation and survival. Mek1 activation may also play a role in differentiation in neuronal tissues. In cultured neuronal PC-12 cells, NGF induces neurite outgrowth via Mek1 and the map kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of Mek1 can transform cells and may play a role in cancer. The crucial role of Mek1 in a variety of pathways including cellular transformation suggests that the cell must tightly regulate its activity. Cdk5 is a kinase that regulates the activity of Mek1. Although Cdk5",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc-gamma-R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.",
  "The G2 / M DNA damage checkpoint prevents the cell from entering mitosis (M phase) if the genome is damaged. The Cdc2-cyclin B kinase is pivotal in regulating this transition. During G2 phase, Cdc2 is maintained in an inactive state by the kinases Wee1 and Mt1. As cells approach M phase, the phosphatase Cdc25 is activated, perhaps by the polo-kinase Pik1. Cdc25 then activates Cdc2, establishing a feedback amplification loop that efficiently drives the cell into mitosis. DNA damage activates the DNA-PK / ATM / ATR kinases, initiating two parallel cascades that inactivate Cdc2-cyclin B. The first cascade rapidly inhibits progression into mitosis: the CHK kinases phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc25, which can no longer activate Cdc2. The second cascade is slower. Phosphorylation of p53 dissociates it from MDM2, activating its DNA binding activity. Acetylation by p300 / PCAF further activates its transcriptional activity. The genes that are turned on by p53 constitute effectors of this second cascade. They include 14-3-3s, which binds to the phosphorylated Cdc2-cyclin B kinase",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an example of lipid messengers with both intracellular and extracellular functions. Intracellularly S1P regulates proliferation and survival; extracellularly S1P is a ligand for EDG1 (also known as S1P1). Activation of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, increases cellular levels of S1P. Inhibitors of SPHK block formation of S1P and inhibit cellular proliferation induced by a variety of factors, including as an example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PMA. In a study using endothelial cells it was demonstrated that S1P induces activation of alpha-v and B3 integrins via RhoA. S1P also activates Akt via Gi and PI3K. The activated Akt phosphorlyates the Edg1 receptor on threonine 236 leading to the activation of Rac1 and subsequent signals leading to actin assembly, chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation. Edg1 stimulation also leads to the activation of the ERK signaling cascade resulting in anti-apoptotic reversal, proliferation and cell survival.",
  "Cell adhesion molecules are (glyco) proteins expressed on the cell surface and play a critical role in a wide array of biologic processes that include hemostasis, the immune response, inflammation, embryogenesis, and development of neuronal tissue. There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. Membrane proteins that mediate immune cellcell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions are important for brain morphology and highly coordinated brain functions such as memory and learning. During early development of the nervous system, neurons elongate their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of cell-cell adhesions. Cell-cell adhesions also underpin axon-axon contacts and link neurons with supporting schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.",
  "To replicate in the host cell, viruses commandeer cellular signaling pathways. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus with that is widespread in the population but usually causes disease only in immunocompromised individuals and is also a viral cause of birth defects. One of the actions of CMV in the host cell is to stimulate MAP kinase pathways. Both p38 and ERK kinases are activated by CMV infection through activation map kinase kinases and inhibition of phosphatases. One result of Map kinase activation by CMV is activation of transcription of viral genes, increasing the production of viral gene products. Both p38 and ERK kinases contribute to the activation of viral genes by cellular transcription factors acting through the viral UL4 promoter at upstream and basal transcription elements. Another target of prolonged p38 activation during infection is Rb, contributing to viral replication. Activation of MKK1 and MKK2 leads to Erk1 and Erk2 activation, and phosphorylation of downstream targets. The MEKK1 kinase regulates the immediate early promoter indirectly through downstream kinase signaling and perhaps more directly through activation of NF-kB. Map kinase pathways activated by CMV converge on increased transcription of viral genes and increased replication of",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.",
  "Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The intrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to the blood or exposure of blood to collagen in a traumatized vessel wall. This usually also results in damage to fragile platelets. The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes 1 to 6 minutes. This cascade begins with the activation of factor XII and the release of platelet factor 3 (PF3) from damaged platelets. Activated factor XII cleaves and actives factor XI and prekallikrein (PK). Factor XII is also activated by activated prekallikrein (aPK) in an internal amplification loop. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for the initial three steps. The prothrombin activator in the intrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the extrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. The GnRHR is coupled to Gq / 11 proteins to activate phospholipase C which transmits its signal to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates the intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and IP3 stimulates release of intracellular calcium. In addition to the classical Gq / 11, coupling of Gs is occasionally observed in a cell-specific fashion. Signaling downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Active MAPKs translocate to the nucleus, resulting in activation of transcription factors and rapid induction of early genes.",
  "Role of -arrestins in the desensitization, sequestration and intracellular trafficking of GPCRs. Homologous desensitization of GPCRs (1) results from the binding of -arrestins (-arr) to agonist -occupied receptors following phosphorylation of the receptor by GRKs. -arrestin binding sterically precludes coupling between the receptor and heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to termination of signaling by G proteins effectors. Receptor-bound -arrestins also act as adapter proteins, binding to components of the clathrin endocytic machinery including clathrin, 2-adaptin (AP-2). Receptor sequestration (2) reflects the dynamin (Dyn) -dependent endocytosis of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits. Once internalized, GPCRs exhibit two distinct patterns of -arrestin interaction. `Class A 'GPCRs, for example the 2 adrenergic receptor, rapidly dissociate from -arrestin upon internalization. These receptors are trafficked to an acidified endosomal compartment, wherein the ligand is dissociated and the receptor dephosphorylated by a GPCR-specific protein phosphatase PP2A isoform, and are subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane (3). `Class B' receptors, for example the angiotensin II AT1a receptor, form stable receptor--arrestin",
  "The mammalian calpain gene family currently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. (An excellent introduction to the calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http: / / ag.arizona.edu / calpains / index.html) One of the most carefully studied functions of the calpains is the regulation of integrin-mediated cell migration. Calpains digests the links between the actin cytoskeleton and several focal adhesion complex proteins; talin, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. The release from the focal adhesion complex facilitates migration. Calpestatin is an inhibitor expressed in most cells. Calpestatin binds the four inhibitory domains of calpain. Release from calpestatin does not activate calpain. Activation requires additional signaling, coactivators and an appropriate calcium concentration. During cell migration calpain1 (mu-calpain) acts at the leading edge as a response to integrin signals or calcium fluxuations due to the stretch activated calcium channels. Calpain1 cleaves the target proteins, talin, exzrin, paxillin and the cytoplasmic tail of the",
  "Myocarditis is a cardiac disease associated with inflammation and injury of the myocardium. It results from various etiologies, both noninfectious and infectious, but coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is still considered the dominant etiological agent. Myocarditis may be caused by direct cytopathic effects of virus, a pathologic immune response to persistent virus, or autoimmunity triggered by the viral infection. The virus enters the myocyte through internalization of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) and its coreceptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Viral proteases cleave various proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to apoptosis. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells. CVB",
  "Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells",
  "Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would",
  "PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene. Recombinant PTEN is capable of dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, the product of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. Many of the cancer-related mutations have been mapped to the phosphatase catalytic domain, it has been suggested that the phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for its tumor suppressor function. The activation of PKB / AKT is regulated in a complex manner via phosphorylation of AKT on Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and ILK (integrin-linked kinase) respectively. Inactivation of PTEN will constitutively activate PKB / AKT pathway. In addition to its role in regulating the PI 3-K / AKT cell survival pathway, PTEN also inhibits growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation and suppresses the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. PTEN also interact with FAK, a key molecule implicated in integrin signaling pathways, and it directly dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK. PTEN down-regulation of p130CAS through FAK results in inhibition of cell migration and spreading.",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved biological pathway that plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations from becoming permanent in dividing cells. MMR also suppresses homologous recombination and was recently shown to play a role in DNA damage signaling. Defects in MMR are associated with genome-wide instability, predisposition to certain types of cancer including HNPCC, resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, and abnormalities in meiosis and sterility in mammalian systems. The Escherichia coli MMR pathway has been extensively studied and is well characterized. In E. coli, the mismatch-activated MutS-MutL-ATP complex licenses MutH to incise the nearest unmethylated GATC sequence. UvrD and an exonuclease generate a gap. This gap is filled by pol III and DNA ligase. The GATC sites are then methylated by Dam. Several human MMR proteins have been identified based on their homology to E. coli MMR proteins. These include human homologs of MutS and MutL. Although E. coli MutS and MutL proteins are homodimers, human MutS and MutL homologs are heterodimers. The role of hemim",
  "Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cell surface receptors like FAS, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death domain like FAS. The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets. Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis have been suggested.",
  "The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of three sites (ser 112,136 and 155). Phosphorylation at these sites results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. While ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with the activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. BAD Ser 155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors.",
  "The mammalian calpain gene family curently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. (An excellent introduction to the Calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http: / / ag.arizona.edu / calpains / index.html) Spreading cells display newly transiently formed integrin adhesion clusters containing Calpain1 (mu-Calpain), cleaved Talin, B3-Integrin and SPTAN1 (Spectrin). Recruitment of Rac to these clusters leads to the activation of Rac and the formation of Rac-induced Focal clusters. The Calpain1 in the integrin clusters initially inactivates RhoA allowing for the formation of lamellipodia. The subsequent activation of newly synthesized RhoA transforms these clusters into Focal Adhesion Complexes and the formation of contractile actin-myosin stress fibers. These mature adhesions do not contain calpain.",
  "The role of Hemophilus influenzae in ear infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes the induction of an inflammatory response through activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. In addition to activation of inflammatory cytokine genes like IL-1 and TNF, H. influenzae activates TLR2 expression and genes involved in mucus production. Hemophilus influenzae activates NF-kB by multiple mechanisms, starting with activation of the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by the p16 protein in the H. influenzae outer membrane. TLR2 plays a key role in innate immune responses and is expressed in high levels in lymphoid cells as well as low levels in epithelial cells. The role of TLR2 was supported by blocking NF-kB activation with a dominant negative TLR2 and increasing it with transfection of a normal TLR2 gene. TLR2 in turn activates TAK1, which activates two divergent signaling pathways. One of these pathways leads to IkB kinase activation, IkB phosphorylation and degradation, releasing the NF-kB heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. In the alternate pathway, TAK1 also activates NF-kB through a Map kinase pathway, activating p38 and NF",
  "The activation of T cells requires a co-stimulatory signal with T cell receptor activation, provided in many cases by activation of CD28 in resting T cells. 4-1BB (CD137) is a member of the TNF receptor gene family that provides another T cell co-stimulatory signal. 4-1BB is expressed by activated cytotoxic and helper T cells and its expression is induced by a variety of T cell stimuli, including activation of the T cell receptor or stimulation with mitogens. The ligand for 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is induced on activated antigen-presenting cells including macrophages, activating T cells expressing 4-1BB. Mice lacking 4-1BB survive and have an altered though functional immune response. T cells of mice lacking 4-1BB proliferate more rapidly than normal T cells, but have reduced cytokine secretion. The costimulatory signal provided by 4-1BB may act in combination with CD28 activation to prolong the T cell response, and may also act independently of CD28. Stimulation of T cells with the 4-1BB ligand may provide a therapeutic immune response in the treatment of cancer or",
  "Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK",
  "Many different peptides act as signaling molecules, including the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin, the protease enzyme thrombin, and the blood pressure regulating peptide angiotensin. While these three proteins are distinct in their sequence and physiology, and act through different cell surface receptors, they share in a common class of cell surface receptors called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other polypeptide ligands of GPCRs include vasopressin, oxytocin, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, GnRH, leutinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, orexins, urotensin II, endorphins, enkephalins, and many others. GPCRs are a broad and diverse gene family that respond not only to peptide ligands but also small molecule neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline), light, odorants, taste, lipids, nucleotides, and ions. The main signaling mechanism used by GPCRs is to interact with G-protein GTPase proteins coupled to downstream second messenger systems including intracellular calcium release and cAMP production. The intracellular signaling systems used by peptide GPCRs are similar to those used by all GPCRs, and are typically classified according to the G-protein they interact with and the second",
  "Bladder cancer arise and progress along two distinctive pathways. The first of these is often preceded by simple and papillary hyperplasia and exhibits a tumour morphology that is low-grade, superficial and papillary. Papillary carcinoma has a tendency to recur locally, but rarely invades and metastasizes. These tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. The second tumour pathway is characterized by high-grade muscle-invasive tumours, which either originate from flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) / severe dysplasia or arise de novo. Over half of these tumours show defects in the tumour suppressors p53 and / or the retinoblastoma protein (RB) genes and pathways, and over 50% of these tumours progress to local and distant metastases. Some of the cell cycle-related molecules show evidence of epigenetic modulation through aberrant promoter hypermethylation in invasive bladder cancer. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors",
  "Interaction of T cell receptor with specific antigen in the context of MHC II activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to T cell activation. In the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the src family kinases Lck and Fyn are activated to phosphorylate proteins in the T cell receptor complex which recruit and activate the ZAP70 kinase. The activation of ZAP70 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate MAP kinase pathways and cause T cell activation. The CD45 phosphorylase also plays a role in T cell receptor signaling, dephosphorylated Lck and Fyn to activate them. Other factors modulate T cell receptor activation. Csk (COOH-terminal Srk kinase) phosphorylates Lck and deactivates it, opposing the action of CD45. The phosphorylation of Lck by Csk inhibits T cell receptor signaling and inhibits T cell activation. Csk activity is regulated in T cells by PKA, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated by the second messenger cAMP. The activity of Csk also appears to depend on other factors such as CBP, which recruits Csk to the plasma membrane in lipid rafts where other signaling factors such the T cell receptor complex are localized. CBP also directly activates Csk.",

  "Growth hormone plays a major role in regulating growth during childhood and adolescence and also regulates metabolism. Defects in growth hormone signaling can result in dwarfism and decreases in growth hormone levels with age have been suggested to play a role in the reduced function of some physiological systems. Growth hormone signals a response in cells through the growth hormone receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Growth hormone causes the receptor to dimerize, activating the JAK2 protein kinase. The activity of JAK2 mediates many of the downstream responses to growth hormone through phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, MAP kinases, other kinase cascades and molecules involved in metabolism like IRS-1. Factors like SOCS and SHP-1 appear to play a role in the down regulation of signaling by growth hormone and cytokines.",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting various pathogens and generating innate immune responses. The intracellular NOD-like receptor (NLR) family contains more than 20 members in mammals and plays a pivotal role in the recognition of intracellular ligands. NOD1 and NOD2, two prototypic NLRs, sense the cytosolic presence of the bacterial peptidoglycan fragments that escaped from endosomal compartments, driving the activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, cytokine production and apoptosis. On the other hand, a different set of NLRs induces caspase-1 activation through the assembly of multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. These NLRs include NALP1, NALP3 and Ipaf. The inflammasomes are critical for generating mature proinflammatory cytokines in concert with Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.",
  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",
  "The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle",
  "The drug Gleevec (also known as imatinib mesylate or STI-571) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of CML, chronic myeloid leukemia. While traditional cytotoxic cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy kill all dividing cells, Gleevec acts on a molecular target by a mechanism that is more specific to cancer cells. Traditional cytotoxic cancer agents have serious side effects such as nausea, weight loss, hair loss and severe fatigue that result from their lack of specificity in killing cells. Gleevec was designed as an inhibitor of a specific receptor associated with CML, and so produces less severe side effects than other cancer agents. CML is associated in most cases with a specific chromosomal defect, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation occurs at the site in the genome of a protein tyrosine kinase called abl, creating the abnormal bcr-abl protein, a fusion of the abl gene with another gene called bcr. The kinase activity of abl in the bcr-abl fusion is activated and unregulated, driving the uncontrolled cell growth observed in CML. White",
  "A key part of the immune system is the production of immunoglobulins (antibodies) by B cells to bind and inactivate specific foreign antigens. The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4 + T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD4",

  "The cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. This transition is regulated by the checkpoint kinase cdk2 that activates the G1 to S transition when it is associated with cyclin E. Cdk2 / Cyclin E causes the G1 to S transition through phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor Rb, releasing the transcription factor E2F-1. Other pathways acting through Rac, Ras and Rho also regulate the G1 to S transition. Ras regulates cyclin D1 expression to affect the G1 to S transition. Transforming forms of Ras or Raf induce cyclin D1 expression and cause early entry into S phase. Signaling from Ras to Raf to MEK to ERKs induces Cyclin D1 expression, allowing Cyclin D1 to complex with Cdk4 and Cdk6 and phosphorylate Rb. Rac-1 and PAK appear to induce Cyclin D1 expression and induce the G1 to S transition primarily through activation of NF-kB to activate the Cyclin D1 promoter. Rho activates cdk2 and also inhibits p21 and p27 to induce cyclin D1 and stimulate the G1 to S transition. Rho represses p21 expression to block p21 induction by Ras and to allow Ras induced progression",

  "Hypertrophy associated with both hypertension and obstruction to ventricular outflow leads to pathologic cardiac growth and it is associated with increase morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic ventricular disease takes a growing toll on the health of nations. As other cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infraction are in decline as causes of mortality, the heart failure problem becomes increasingly urgent. Congenital heart defects occur in 1% of live births and fetal heart malformations are implicated in many pregnancies that end in still-birth or spontaneous abortion. The current paradigm suggests that the heart adapts to excess of hemodynamic loading by compensatory hypertrophy, which under condition of persistent stress, over time evolves into dysfunction and myocardial failure. There is considerable evidence that direct effects of increased mechanical stress are sensed within the ventricular wall and that signals critical for the generation of growth responses. Despite compelling statistics we still do not understand biochemically why heart defects are so prevalent. A single transcriptional regulator initially associated with the activation of the T-cells",
  "Several forms of post-translational modification regulate protein activities. Recently, protein methylation by CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) has been observed to play a key role in transcriptional regulation. CARM1 associates with the p160 class of transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by steroid hormone family receptors. CARM1 also interacts with CBP / p300 transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by a large variety of transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors and CEBP. One target of CARM1 is the core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets of the histone acetylase activity of CBP / p300 coactivators. Recruitment of CARM1 to the promoter region by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and makes promoter regions more accessible for transcription. Another target of CARM1 methylation is a coactivator it interacts with, CBP. Methylation of CBP by CARM1 blocks CBP from acting as a coactivator for CREB and redirects the limited CBP pool in the cell to be available for steroid hormone receptors. Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known.",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mechanism to recognize and repair bulky DNA damage caused by compounds, environmental carcinogens, and exposure to UV-light. In humans hereditary defects in the NER pathway are linked to at least three diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The repair of damaged DNA involves at least 30 polypeptides within two different sub-pathways of NER known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR-NER) and global genome repair (GGR-NER). TCR refers to the expedited repair of lesions located in the actively transcribed strand of genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). In GGR-NER the first step of damage recognition involves XPC-hHR23B complex together with XPE complex (in prokaryotes, uvrAB complex). The following steps of GGR-NER and TCR-NER are similar.",
  "About 2-5% of type II diabetic patients suffer from a monogenic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. This monogenic form of type II diabetes is called maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We now know that MODY is caused by heterozygous mutations in at least five genes encoding transcription factors: HNF4alpha (MODY1), HNF1alpha (MODY3), PDX1 (MODY4), HNF1beta (MODY5) and NEUROD1 (MODY6). MODY2, which is so far the only subtype not related to a transcription factor, is caused by mutations in the glucokinase gene. Mutations of MODY transcription factor genes lead to abnormal expression of genes involved in pancreatic islet development and metabolism.",
  "The Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway involving eight enzymes essential for energy production through aerobic respiration, and, like glycolysis, arose early in evolution. This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is most commonly known as the cytokine secreted by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production and is used as a drug for the treatment of anemias. Epo is also secreted in the brain in response to hypoxia, such as ischemic stroke. Epo production in the brain is stimulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Administration of Epo to the brain in rodents before hypoxic stress or other neuronal stresses is neuroprotective, preventing neuronal apoptosis. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is known to associate with JAK kinases that phosphorylate and activate the STAT family of transcription factors. The neuroprotection by Epo involves cross-talk between Epo receptor and anti-apoptotic pathways through activation of NF-kB by the JAK2 kinase. Epo stimulates JAK2 phosphorylation of I-kB, releasing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of neuroprotective genes. Neuroprotective genes activated by NF-kB include the anti-oxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase and calbindin-D (28k). The erythropoietin receptor is also essential for proper brain development in mice. The absence of EpoR causes high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the developing",
  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs triggers the assembly of a MAP kinase activation complex using -arrestin as a scaffold, with subsequent activation of a -arrestin-bound pool of ERK1 / 2. The receptor-arrestinERK complexes are localized to endosomal vesicles, and their formation does not result in nuclear translocation of activated ERK1 / 2 or stimulation of cell proliferation. The function of -arrestin-bound ERK1 / 2 is presently unknown. Activation of ERK1 / 2 by -arrestin scaffolds may favor the phosphorylation of plasma membrane, cytosolic, or cytoskeletal ERK1 / 2 substrates, or it may lead to transcriptional activation through the ERK-dependent activation of other kinases. The model depicts -arrestin scaffolding of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade, based upon data obtained with the protease-activated PAR2 and angiotensin AT1a receptors. A similar mechanism has been proposed for regulation of the JNK3 MAP kinase cascade by AT1a receptors.",
  "The transcription factor CREB binds the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and activates transcription in response to a variety of extracellular signals including neurotransmitters, hormones, membrane depolarization, and growth and neurotrophic factors. Protein kinase A and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CaMKII stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, a key regulatory site controlling transcriptional activity. Growth and neurotrophic factors also stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133. Phosphorylation occurs at Ser133 via p44 / 42 MAP Kinase and p90RSK and also via p38 MAP Kinase and MSK1. CREB exhibit deficiencies in spatial learning tasks, while flies overexpressing or lacking CREB show enhanced or diminished learning, respectively.",
  "This group of genes does not group into a meaningful cluster.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that stimulates neuronal survival and growth through TrkA, a member of the trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors that also includes TrkB and TrkC. Some NGF responses are also mediated or modified by p75LNTR, a low affinity neurotrophin receptor. Binding of NGF to TrkA stimulates neuronal survival, and also proliferation. Pathways coupled to these responses are linked to TrkA through association of signaling factors with specific amino acids in the TrkA cytoplasmic domain. Cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis is signaled through activation of PI3-kinase and AKT. Ras-mediated signaling and phospholipase C both activate the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate proliferation.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), a multi-functional kinase, and its neuron-specific activator p35 are required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Proteolytic cleavage of p35 produces p25, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conversion of p35 to p25 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5 and the hyperphosphorylates tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments and promotes apoptosis. In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress and calcium influx induce the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates, addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific inhibitors of calpain1, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In vitro, calpain1 directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative molecular mass 25,000. Application of the amyloid beta-peptide A beta induces the conversion of p35 to p25 in primary cortical neurons. Inhibition of cdk5 or calpain activity reduces cell death in A beta-treated cortical",
  "Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the",
  "One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",
  "IGF-1R, the type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor, mediates cell survival and growth in response to its ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. This tyrosine kinase receptor is widely expressed in many cell types and is a key mediator of growth. Overexpression or activation of IGF-1R may be involved in the proliferation of transformed cells, making inhibition of IGF-1R signaling a strategy for the development of cancer drugs. IGF-1R activates three signaling pathways that converge to phosphorylate BAD protein and block apoptosis. The first pathway activated by IGF-1R stimulates PI3-kinase and the AKT pathway to phosphorylate BAD and block apoptosis. A second pathway activated by IGF-1R involves ras mediated activation of the map kinase pathway to block apoptosis. A third pathway involves interaction of raf with mitochondria in response to IGF-1R activation. The convergence of these pathways to block apoptosis may enhance the IGF-1R response.",
  "IL-5 is an inflammatory signaling molecule that primarily stimulates eosinophil proliferation, maturation and activation. Eosinophils are leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses that defend against parasites and cause some aspects of asthma, allergic reactions, and perhaps autoimmune disorders. The action of IL-5 begins with an immune response in tissues, such as activation of macrophages and T cells that secrete IL-1, IL-4 and IL-6. The immune response can lead to IL-5 secretion by T cells, eosinophils and mast cells. Secreted IL-5 stimulates production and maturation of eosinophils in bone marrow that migrate to tissues in response to eotaxin and release factors that damage tissues, causing some of the undesirable consequences of inflammation. The receptor for IL-5 is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit that is required for IL-5 selective binding and a beta subunit that is also part of the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors. Binding of IL-5 to the IL-5 receptor at the cell surface activates JAK / STAT signaling pathways that regulate transcription, proliferation, and differentiation.",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specifically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.",
  "Growth hormone plays a major role in regulating growth during childhood and adolescence and also regulates metabolism. Defects in growth hormone signaling can result in dwarfism and decreases in growth hormone levels with age have been suggested to play a role in the reduced function of some physiological systems. Growth hormone signals a response in cells through the growth hormone receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Growth hormone causes the receptor to dimerize, activating the JAK2 protein kinase. The activity of JAK2 mediates many of the downstream responses to growth hormone through phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, MAP kinases, other kinase cascades and molecules involved in metabolism like IRS-1. Factors like SOCS and SHP-1 appear to play a role in the down regulation of signaling by growth hormone and cytokines.",
  "Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2 / TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP) / TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) / TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to",
  "Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas-ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas-mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling is also involved in immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of FAS to oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 are first activated, to then cleave and activate downstream caspases, and a variety of cellular substrates that lead to cell death. Caspases cleave nuclear lamins, causing the nucleus to break down and lose its normal structure and another caspase substrate is DFF, inducing cleavage and degradation of the genome. Other caspase substrates are involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways. Activation of JNK",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.",
  "Proposed model for b2-AR- and prostanoid-receptor-mediated PLC and calcium signalling. Receptors coupling to Gs stimulate AC, resulting in elevated cAMP levels and activation of Epac1. Epac1 then catalyses GTP-loading on Rap2B, which leads to PLC-e activation. The proposed pathway may involve additional signalling components to attain PLC stimulation. The action of cAMP seems to be independent of PKA; Instead, the cAMP-activated Rap-GEF Epac seems to serve as a cAMP effector, inducing GTP loading and, hence, activation of Rap2B, which then leads to specific activation of PLC-e, which has been shown to interact with Rap GTPases. It is an attractive hypothesis, therefore, that the Rap-dependent PLC and calcium signalling pathway reported here is not restricted to Gs-and AC-coupled receptors, such as the b2-AR and the prostanoid receptor, but could be used by other receptors as well.",
  "Insulin binding to its receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (INSR). This allows association of IRSs with the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which activates Akt, a serine kinase. Akt in turn deactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), leading to activation of glycogen synthase (GYS) and thus glycogen synthesis. Activation of Akt also results in the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles from their intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, where they allow uptake of glucose into the cell. Akt also leads to mTOR-mediated activation of protein synthesis by eIF4 and p70S6K. The translocation of GLUT4 protein is also elicited through the CAP / Cbl / TC10 pathway, once Cbl is phosphorylated by INSR. Other signal transduction proteins interact with IRS including GRB2. GRB2 is part of the cascade including SOS, RAS, RAF and MEK that leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitogenic responses in the form of",
  "This diagram is a compilation of Pyk2 effort cascades. In specific cell types the receptor and effoectors will vary. Binding of a transmembrane receptor triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1. In turn, Rac1 initiatates the JNK cascade, starting with PAK follwed by MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK. JNK activation causes induction of c-Jun gene binding. Pyk2 stimulation has also been shown to activate MKK3 leading to activation of p38. The other major mitogen activated kinase cascade for ERK1 / 2 is stimulated via RAS, RAF and MEKK1 / 2.",
  "The citrate cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle) is an important aerobic pathway for the final steps of the oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids. The cycle starts with acetyl-CoA, the activated form of acetate, derived from glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation for carbohydrates and from beta oxidation of fatty acids. The two-carbon acetyl group in acetyl-CoA is transferred to the four-carbon compound of oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon compound of citrate. In a series of reactions two carbons in citrate are oxidized to CO2 and the reaction pathway supplies NADH for use in the oxidative phosphorylation and other metabolic processes. The pathway also supplies important precursor metabolites including 2-oxoglutarate. At the end of the cycle the remaining four-carbon part is transformed back to oxaloacetate. According to the genome sequence data, many organisms seem to lack genes for the full cycle, but contain genes for specific segments.",
  "Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in eukaryotic cellular processes. It mainly functions as a signal for 26S proteasome dependent protein degradation. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins being degraded is performed by a reaction cascade consisting of three enzymes, named E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). Each E3 has specificity to its substrate, or proteins to be targeted by ubiquitination. Many E3s are discovered in eukaryotes and they are classified into four types: HECT type, U-box type, single RING-finger type, and multi-subunit RING-finger type. Multi-subunit RING-finger E3s are exemplified by cullin-Rbx E3s and APC / C. They consist of a RING-finger-containing subunit (RBX1 or RBX2) that functions to bind E2s, a scaffold-like cullin molecule, adaptor proteins, and a target recognizing subunit that binds substrates.",
  "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units and form proteglycans by covalently attaching to their core proteins. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan with the disaccharide unit GalNAc (b1-4) GlcA (b1-3), modified with ester-linked sulfate at certain positions. Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a modified form of CS, in which a portion of D-glucuronate residues is epimerized to L-iduronates. CS and DS are linked to serine residues in core proteins via a linkage tetrasaccharide formed by the transfer of xylose and three more residues. The assembly process of CS is initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The polymerization step is catalyzed by bifunctional enzymes (chondroitin synthases) that have both b13 glucuronosyltransferase and b14 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activities. Chondroitin polymerization also requires the action of the chondroitin polymerizing factor. Sulfation of chondroitin in vertebrates is a complex process, with multiple sulfotransferases involved in 4-O sulfation and 6-O sulfation of N-",
  "Cell adhesion molecules are (glyco) proteins expressed on the cell surface and play a critical role in a wide array of biologic processes that include hemostasis, the immune response, inflammation, embryogenesis, and development of neuronal tissue. There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. Membrane proteins that mediate immune cellcell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions are important for brain morphology and highly coordinated brain functions such as memory and learning. During early development of the nervous system, neurons elongate their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of cell-cell adhesions. Cell-cell adhesions also underpin axon-axon contacts and link neurons with supporting schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.",
  "Thrombin is an extracellular protease that is involved in the clotting of blood and inflammation through its action on platelets and endothelial cells in the vasculature and that plays a role in thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cellular targets of thrombin signaling and members of the G-protein coupled receptor gene family. Both of these receptors are cleaved in their N-terminus by thrombin, unmasking a portion of the receptor sequence that acts itself as a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered ligand that activates PAR1 is SFLLRN and the tethered ligand that activates PAR4 is GYPGQV. Other members of the family include PAR2 which is activated by trypsin rather than thrombin and PAR3 which seems to play a role in the activation of other PARs but does not itself transduce a signal directly. Addition of peptide agonist exogenously in solution can also activate PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4. PAR1 activation may be involved in the dilation of arteries during inflammation through the action of thrombin on endothelial cells and in platelet activation by thrombin during clotting. PAR1 and PAR2 activation cause bronchodilation in airway and may protect against",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The extrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to vascular walls or extravascular tissues. The damaged tissue releases tissue thromboplastin also known as tissue factor (TF). The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes as little as 15 seconds. This cascade is initiated by the activation of factor X by TF and factor VII. Activated factor X combined with factor V, factor VII and TF constitutes the prothrombin activator. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for each of these steps. The prothrombin activator in the extrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the intrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also the step leading to the activation of factor X. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin. Protein",
  "Nitric oxide (NO) has a number of important physiological actions in the cardiovascular system. In the heart, NO plays role in keeping the vessels patent via vasodilation and prevention of platelet aggregation. It also plays an important role in regulating the force and rate of contraction. In vivo NO is released by shear stress of ligands that increase intracellular Ca2 + in endothelial cells. The increase intracellular Ca2 + activates nitric oxide synthase III (NOSIII) by promoting the binding of Ca / Calmodulin to the enzyme. NOSIII, which is resident in the Golgi complex, is transported together with caveolin-1 to the caveolae at the plasma membrane via vesicles. Shear stress signals via a potassium channel and the cytoskeleton, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequently in activation of Akt kinase. Akt activation by shear stress but also by VEGF activates NOSIII by serine phosphorylation, which increases the affinity of NOSIII for calmodulin. After agonist binding at the plasma membrane, NOSIII-activating receptors translocate to caveolae. VEGF receptor signals via its tyrosine kinase domain. Furthermore, agonist",
  "Leukocyte migaration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation. During this diapedesis of leukocytes, the leukocytes bind to endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM) and then migrate across the vascular endothelium. A leukocyte adherent to CAMs on the endothelial cells moves forward by leading-edge protrusion and retraction of its tail. In this process, alphaL / beta2 integrin activates through Vav1, RhoA, which subsequently activates the kinase p160ROCK. ROCK activation leads to MLC phosphorylation, resulting in retraction of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Leukocytes activate endothelial cell signals that stimulate endothelial cell retraction during localized dissociation of the endothelial cell junctions. ICAM-1-mediated signals activate an endothelial cell calcium flux and PKC, which are required for ICAM-1 dependent leukocyte migration. VCAM-1 is involved in the opening of the endothelial passage through which leukocytes can extravasate. In this regard, VCAM-1 ligation induces NADPH oxidase activation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a Rac-mediated manner, with subsequent activation of matrix metallopoteinases and loss of VE-cadherin-mediated",
  "A key part of the immune system is the production of immunoglobulins (antibodies) by B cells to bind and inactivate specific foreign antigens. The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4 + T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD4",
  "The scanning translation initiation model suggests that 40S ribosomal subunit preloaded with factors bind to the 5 end of the mRNA near the cap. The 48S subunit moves along the mRNA until it finds the initiation triplet and in complex with tRNA and 60S subunit formed the first peptide bond. Translation control is mostly regulated at the protein initiation step through translation initiation factors such as eIF2 or eIF4.",
  "Pathogenic Salmonella enter cells such as those of the intestinal epithelium by altering cellular cytoskeletal structure and inducing membrane ruffling of the infected cell. Salmonella is able to alter the cytoskeleton and membrane through the action of secreted bacterial Sip proteins, SopE, SopB, and SptP that are inserted into the cytosol of the infected cell. Sip proteins encoded by Salmonella are required for the action of SopE and for the invasion of epithelial cells. SipA stabilizes actin filaments, inducing membrane ruffling and perhaps focusing membrane changes where bacteria are localized to allow their entry. SipC produces a similar effect on actin filaments and cytoskeletal structure. SopE acts as an exchange factor on Rac1 and Cdc42, two GTPases in the Rho family that regulate actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 by Salmonella SopE induces changes in cytoskeleton structure that allow bacterial entry into the cell. SopB is another salmonella protein that acts as an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and also stimulates Cdc42 and Rac1. One of the cellular targets of both Cdc42 and Rac1 that affects actin structure is the Arp2 / 3 complex. Cdc",
  "Hypoxia (or low O2 levels) affects various pathologies. First, tissue ischemia, a variation in O2 tension caused by hypoxia / reoxygenation, can lead to endothelial cell changes. For example, long periods of ischemia result in endothelial changes, such as vascular leakage, resulting in varicose veins. In more severe situations, ischemia can lead to myocardial or cerebral infarction and retinal vessel occlusion. Of interest, HIF-1 is stabilized prior to induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression during acute ischemia in the human heart. Second, pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic respiratory disorders results from persistent vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. Third, hypoxic gradients created in enlarging solid tumors trigger expression of genes containing hypoxia response element (HRE) s such as those involved in angiogenesis. This allows subsequent delivery of O2, nutrients, and further tumor growth. Vascular remodeling is an important component to tumorigenesis; without proper blood supply, delivery of oxygen may occur by diffusion, but becomes inefficient in tumors greater than 1 mm in diameter. Short-term hypoxia can also elevate platelet numbers, while prolonged exposure may cause some degree of thrombocytopenia in response to increased levels of erythropo",
  "Myocardial infraction (MI) is the condition of irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle that results from prolonged ischemia. Nearly 1.5 million people in US sustain an MI each year, and this event proves fatal in approximately one third of patients. Approximately 90% of MI result from formation of an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The thrombus transforms a region of plaque narrowing to one of complete vessel occlusion (top right in pink). The responsible thrombus appears to be generated by interactions between the atherosclerotic plaque, the coronary endothelium, circulating platelets, and dynamic vasomotor tone of the vessel wall, all of which overwhelm natural protective mechanisms. The endogenous protective mechanisms against thrombosis include: 1. Inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III (ATIII), the effectiveness of which is enhanced by binding of ATIII to heparin sulafate. The antithrombin binding region of commercial heparin consists of sulfated disaccharide units (bottom panel). 2. Inactivation of clotting factors Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (protein C *), an action that is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombomodulin (TM)",
  "Initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is a highly conserved, multi-step process (replication licensing) designed to restrict initiation events to once per replication origin per S phase. Its control has been uncovered by the discovery of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) as master regulators of the cell cycle and the initiator proteins of DNA replication, such as the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 / 18, Cdt1 and the mini-chromosome maintenance complex (Mcm). The proteins and the sequence of events involved in this process are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. First, the ORC comprised of six proteins binds to replication origins in the chromosomal DNA. At the end of mitosis, ORC, Cdc6 / 18 and Cdt1 assist the binding of Mcm proteins 27 to chromatin, and chromatin becomes licensed for replication. The activated Mcm complex functions as a replicating helicase and moves along with the replication fork to bring the origins to the unlicensed state. The cycling of CDK activity in the cell cycle regulates the two states of replication origins, the licensed state in G1-phase and the unlicensed state for the rest of the",
  "Interaction of T cell receptor with specific antigen in the context of MHC II activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to T cell activation. In the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the src family kinases Lck and Fyn are activated to phosphorylate proteins in the T cell receptor complex which recruit and activate the ZAP70 kinase. The activation of ZAP70 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate MAP kinase pathways and cause T cell activation. The CD45 phosphorylase also plays a role in T cell receptor signaling, dephosphorylated Lck and Fyn to activate them. Other factors modulate T cell receptor activation. Csk (COOH-terminal Srk kinase) phosphorylates Lck and deactivates it, opposing the action of CD45. The phosphorylation of Lck by Csk inhibits T cell receptor signaling and inhibits T cell activation. Csk activity is regulated in T cells by PKA, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated by the second messenger cAMP. The activity of Csk also appears to depend on other factors such as CBP, which recruits Csk to the plasma membrane in lipid rafts where other signaling factors such the T cell receptor complex are localized. CBP also directly activates Csk.",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) provide a potent proliferative signaling system that stimulates growth in many different cell types and blocks apoptosis. In vivo IGF-1 acts as an intermediate of many growth hormone responses, and may stimulate the growth of some types of cancer. IGF-1 also provides a mitogenic signal to act as a growth factor for many tissue culture cells. One component of IGF-1 mitogenic signaling is association of the receptor tyrosine kinase with Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1 to activate ras and the Map kinase cascade (raf, Mek, Erk). An endpoint of the Map kinase pathway is modification of transcription factor activity, such as activation of ELK transcription factors. Serum response factor (SRF) and AP-1 contribute to mitogenic signaling by many factors. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI3 kinase activation are also involved in IGF-1 signaling, similar to insulin signaling.",
  "The drug Gleevec (also known as imatinib mesylate or STI-571) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of CML, chronic myeloid leukemia. While traditional cytotoxic cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy kill all dividing cells, Gleevec acts on a molecular target by a mechanism that is more specific to cancer cells. Traditional cytotoxic cancer agents have serious side effects such as nausea, weight loss, hair loss and severe fatigue that result from their lack of specificity in killing cells. Gleevec was designed as an inhibitor of a specific receptor associated with CML, and so produces less severe side effects than other cancer agents. CML is associated in most cases with a specific chromosomal defect, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation occurs at the site in the genome of a protein tyrosine kinase called abl, creating the abnormal bcr-abl protein, a fusion of the abl gene with another gene called bcr. The kinase activity of abl in the bcr-abl fusion is activated and unregulated, driving the uncontrolled cell growth observed in CML. White",
  "Several different cell types coordinate their efforts as part of the immune system, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. Each of these cell types has a distinct role in the immune system, and communicates with other immune cells using secreted factors called cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, and the interferons. Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and are antigen-presenting cells, using cytokines to stimulate specific antigen dependent responses by B and T cells and non-specific responses by other cell types. T cells secrete a variety of factors to coordinate and stimulate immune responses to specific antigen, such as the role of helper T cells in B cell activation in response to antigen. The proliferation and activation of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils respond to cytokines as well. Cytokine communication is often local, within a tissue or between cells in close proximity. Each of the cytokines is secreted by one set of cells and provokes a response in another target set of cells, often including the cell that secretes the cytokine. Some cytokines, like IL-1, interferons and TNF, stimulate a broad inflammatory response in response to infection or injury.",
  "The epidermis, which provides a protective barrier that undergoes a constant renewal, is a multi-layered tissue with the proliferating cells located in the basal layer. As cells leave the basal layer the underog significant differentiation, biochemical and morphological remodeling. The final differentiation results in the formation of corneocytes. In vitro keratinocytes mimic this process. Several genes mark keratinocyte specific differentiation. Among the most frequently tracked markers are Transglutaminase, Cystatin and Involucrin. The keratinocyte differentiation studies have identified and provided significant detail regarding the involvement of three of the 4 major MAP kinase pathways from several diverse stimuli such as EGF, FAS, TNF and Calicium influx. The p38 cascade is represented twice since both p38alpha (p38) and p38delta (MAPK13) are involved. The keratinocyte differentiation cascased also provide for detailed study of the functions of individual PKC isoforms. It is interesting to note the contrasting functions of the PKC isoforms in this process. In recent studies it has been determined that the cPKC (conventional / classical Protein Kinase C) isoforms, which are calcium-",
  "The insulin resistance of type II diabetes appears to be caused in part by the presence of high levels of lipids in cells such as skeletal muscle where this would not normally be found. The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import",
  "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The hallmark of this disease is the selective death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as seen in some familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) cases, may be toxic because it is unstable, forming aggregates in the motor neuron cytoplasm, axoplasm and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM / TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS) via aberrant superoxide chemistry. These changes may then result in abnormal mitochondrial energy metabolism, Ca2 + handling, and release of pro-apoptotic factors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess causes neurotoxicity by increasing intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions by various means including",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, which include TGF-betas, activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are structurally related secreted cytokines found in species ranging from worms and insects to mammals. A wide spectrum of cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration are regulated by TGF-beta family members. TGF-beta family member binds to the Type II receptor and recruits Type I, whereby Type II receptor phosphorylates and activates Type I. The Type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads: Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8). Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and the heteromeric complex then translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Smad complexes activate specific genes through cooperative interactions with other DNA-binding and coactivator (or co-repressor) proteins.",
  "TACI and BCMA signal transduction pathway that enhances cell survival APRIL and BAFF (also called TALL-I and BLyS) are TNF family members that act as ligands for the BCMA and TACI receptors. Both APRIL and BAFF bind to both the BCMA and TACI receptors to activate the humoral immune response, stimulating B cell immunoglobulin production and proliferation. BAFF is found as a membrane bound form in T cells and a soluble form that is released from the cell to stimulate B cell proliferation and differentiation. As members of the TNF receptor gene family, BCMA and TACI interact with TRAF family members to transduce signals downstream to NF-kappaB activation and MAP kinase pathways. Abnormally active BAFF or APRIL signaling may play a role in autoimmune disorders such as lupus.",
  "The pentose phosphate pathway is a process of glucose turnover that produces NADPH as reducing equivalents and pentoses as essential parts of nucleotides. There are two different phases in the pathway. One is irreversible oxidative phase in which glucose-6P is converted to ribulose-5P by oxidative decarboxylation, and NADPH is generated. The other is reversible non-oxidative phase in which phosphorylated sugars are interconverted to generate xylulose-5P, ribulose-5P, and ribose-5P. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) formed from ribose-5P is an activated compound used in the biosynthesis of histidine and purine / pyrimidine nucleotides. This pathway map also shows the Entner-Doudoroff pathway where 6-P-gluconate is dehydrated and then cleaved into pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3P.",
  "Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cell surface receptors like FAS, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death domain like FAS. The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets. Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis have been suggested.",
  "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), two neuropeptides present in the lymphoid microenvironment, elicit a broad spectrum of biological functions, including the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Another important immunoregulatory function of VIP and PACAP is their inhibition effect on AICD in T cells. They inhibit the TCR-stimulated FasL expression and apoptosis of T cell through specific receptors and induction of intracellular cAMP. VIP down-regulate c-Myc synthesis, the NF-AT-dependent Egr2 and Egr3 expression, the NF-AT and NF-kB.",
  "Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy, is the molecular basis for learning and memory. Tetanic stimulation of afferents in the CA1 region of the hippocampus induces glutamate release and activation of glutamate receptors in dendritic spines. A large increase in i resulting from influx through NMDA receptors leads to constitutive activation of CaM kinase II (CaM KII). Constitutively active CaM kinase II phosphorylates AMPA receptors, resulting in potentiation of the ionic conductance of AMPA receptors. Early-phase LTP (E-LTP) expression is due, in part, to this phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized that postsynaptic Ca2 + increases generated through NMDA receptors activate several signal transduction pathways including the Erk / MAP kinase and cAMP regulatory pathways. The convergence of these pathways at the level of the CREB / CRE transcriptional pathway may increase expression of a family of genes required for late-phase LTP (L-LTP).",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "Initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is a highly conserved, multi-step process (replication licensing) designed to restrict initiation events to once per replication origin per S phase. Its control has been uncovered by the discovery of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) as master regulators of the cell cycle and the initiator proteins of DNA replication, such as the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 / 18, Cdt1 and the mini-chromosome maintenance complex (Mcm). The proteins and the sequence of events involved in this process are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. First, the ORC comprised of six proteins binds to replication origins in the chromosomal DNA. At the end of mitosis, ORC, Cdc6 / 18 and Cdt1 assist the binding of Mcm proteins 27 to chromatin, and chromatin becomes licensed for replication. The activated Mcm complex functions as a replicating helicase and moves along with the replication fork to bring the origins to the unlicensed state. The cycling of CDK activity in the cell cycle regulates the two states of replication origins, the licensed state in G1-phase and the unlicensed state for the rest of the",
  "Map kinases transduce responses to extracellular signals by a variety of routes, and communicate with other pathways through extensive crosstalk networks. A closely studied Map kinase cascade originates with tyrosine kinase activation, and activation of Ras. Ras activates Raf, Raf activates the Map kinase kinases Mek1 and Mek2 and these kinases activate downstream Map kinases like Erk1 and Erk2. Erk1 and Erk2 in turn activate transgenes like p35 through the Map kinase activated transcription factor EGR-1. Mek1 plays a central role in many different Map kinase pathways. Factors that activate Mek1 include growth factors like NGF, cytokines, chemokines, and phorbol ester, resulting in cellular proliferation and survival. Mek1 activation may also play a role in differentiation in neuronal tissues. In cultured neuronal PC-12 cells, NGF induces neurite outgrowth via Mek1 and the map kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of Mek1 can transform cells and may play a role in cancer. The crucial role of Mek1 in a variety of pathways including cellular transformation suggests that the cell must tightly regulate its activity. Cdk5 is a kinase that regulates the activity of Mek1. Although Cdk5",
  "The molecular events that lead to the perception of pain are a key research field in medicine and drug discovery. The opioid receptors modulate pain signaling in response to endogenous peptide ligands and opiate drugs such as morphine. The kappa opioid receptor plays a key role in the profound analgesia of opiates and is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand dynorphin, encoded by the prodynorphin gene. Production of prodynorphin is transcriptionally regulated by a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the prodynorphin gene. A transcription factor called DREAM (DRE antagonistic modulator) binds to the DRE and represses prodynorphin transcription when bound. DREAM binds calcium with 4 EF-hand motifs and the binding of DREAM to DNA is repressed in the presence of calcium. Many transcription factors are regulated by calcium indirectly through calcium sensitive kinases and phosphatases, but DREAM is unique to date in being a transcription factor that directly binds calcium and is regulated by calcium binding. DREAM may also regulate other genes such as c-fos. DREAM is expressed in spinal cord neurons in regions involved in pain signaling. The regulation of prodynorphin expression by DREAM also leads to the hypothesis that DREAM is involved in pain signaling",
  "Many transcription factors play essential roles in normal development by determining the proliferation and differentiation of cells. The coordinated transcriptional control of proliferation in specific developmental cell types is crucial in multiple developmental settings. One of a family of three bicoid-related transcription factors, Pitx2 acts downstream of the extracellular signaling protein Wnt to drive proliferation of cells with specific developmental fates, including cells in the pituitary, cardiac outflow region, and muscle. Wnt binds to Frizzled, a G-protein coupled receptor, activating homologs of the Drosophila Disheveled protein. Activation of Frizzled and Disheveled inhibits the kinase GSK-3 beta, part of a protein complex in the absence of Wnt signaling, causing beta-catenin protein to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Beta-catenin is known to alter the function of transcription factors like TCF / Lef. One result of Wnt signaling is activation of the transcription factor Lef by beta-catenin, inducing Pitx2 expression. Wnt activation also changes Pitx2 from a repressor to an activator by causing transcriptional corepressors like histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) bound to Pitx2 to be exchanged for coactivators. With coactivators bound",
  "Attachment of the ubiquitin peptide to proteins targets them for proteolytic degradation by a complex cellular structure, the proteasome. The regulated proteolysis of proteins by proteasomes removes denatured, damaged or improperly translated proteins from cells and regulates the level of proteins like cyclins or some transcription factors. E1 and E2 enzymes prepare ubiquitin chains that are then attached to proteins by the E3 enzyme. The sequence of ubiquitin and the basic structure and function of the proteasome are highly conserved. The core proteasome in man (20S proteasome) consists of four rings each with 14 subunits stacked on top of each other that are responsible for the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. The PA700 regulatory complex is stacked on the ends of the cylindrical core to form a 26S proteasome. Proteins that are tagged with ubiquitin are recognized and bound by the regulatory subunits, then unfolded in an ATP-dependent manner, and inserted into the core particle, where proteases degrade the protein, releasing small peptides and releasing the ubiquitin intact. The PA28 regulatory complex is alternative regulatory complex that appears to play a role in antigen processing for presentation of peptides to immune cells in the",
  "Cell cycle checkpoint controls at the G1 to S transition and the G2 to M transition prevent the cell cycle from progressing when DNA is damaged. The ATM protein kinase detects DNA damage and in response to this activates DNA repair factors and inhibits cell cycle progression. Two of the proteins that ATM phosphorylates in response to DNA damage are the tumor suppressor p53 and the checkpoint kinase chk1. In turn, the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with p21 to block the activity of cdk2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2) preventing passage from G1 to S phase and harmful replication of damaged DNA. One of the targets of cdk2 is the Rb gene product, another tumor suppressor. When dephosphorylated, Rb interacts with E2F transcription factors and prevents transcription of genes required for progression through the cell cycle. When phosphorylated by cell cycle dependent kinases like cdk2 and cdk4, Rb no longer interacts with E2F and the cell cycle proceeds through the G1-S checkpoint. DNA damage also regulates the G2-M phase transition by acting on the cell cycle regulator cdc2.",
  "Protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIIalpha (PKA-RIIa) is tightly bound to centrosomal structures during interphase through interaction with the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP350 (also known as AKAP450 and CGNAP), MAP2 and Pericentrin. This diagram illustrates these three PKA-RII binding complexes. The cyclin B-p34 (cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate PKA-RIIa on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of PKA-RIIa at the on set of mitosis. It has been demonstrated that PKA-RIIa dissociates and redistributes from centrosomes at mitosis. The focal point of this illustration is the AKAP350 complex. In addition to binding PKA-RIIa, AKAP350 binds PKN (Takahashi et al 1999) and the phosphatases PP1 and PPA2 (Takahashi et al 1999). PKN is a serine / threonine protein kinase, having a catalytic domain homologous to the PKC family in the C-terminal region and a unique",
  "Terminal differentiation of cells is often accompanied by repression of cellular proliferation, suggesting that there is a mechanism by which these cellular functions are coordinated. Macrophage differentiation is one model system in which this occurs; as macrophages differentiate, they also stop proliferating. Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in cell cycle progression as well as many differentiation processes. Ras stimulates cell cycle progression in part through Ets transcription factors that bind to cell cycle regulatory genes to activate their expression. Ets transcription factors also help to induce early macrophage differentiation. The activation of Ras signaling by M-CSF activates transcription of genes involved in differentiation through the coordinate expression of both Ets factors and AP-1. Other genes involved in cell cycle regulation involved the coordinate action of E2F-1 and Ets transcription factors. Mets is a factor related in sequence to Ets2 that is upregulated during macrophage differentiation. Increased expression of the Mets protein during macrophage differentiation allows the creation of heterodimers with DP103 to act as transcriptional repressors of cell cycle progression genes, recruiting corepressor to promoters they interact with. DP103 is a gene previously identified as an RNA helicase involved in RNA",
  "The calcium / calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are involved in a large number of cellular responses induced by hormones, neurotransmitters and other signalling. Elevation of calcium functions as a major second messenger, where the intracellular concentration of calcium can be maintained at extremely low levels and susequently increased following specific calcium-mobilizing stimuli. There are many buffers to the calcium fluxuations including membrane pumps and calcium-binding proteins that create discrete spatial control of its effectors and their targets. The current family of multifunctional calcium / calmodulin (CaM) -dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) consists of CaMKI, CaMKII and CaMKIV. These kinases translate and co-ordinate the calcium fluxuations into the appropriate cellular responses via phosphorylation. These kinases are partially regulated by the intracellular calcium receptor calmodulin (CaM), have common as well as unique features in their structure, regulation and activation. CaMKII, CaMKI and CaMKIV, have an autoregulatory domain that restricts or inhibits enzymic activity in the absence of calcium / CaM. Calcium / CaM binding alone produces maximal activity of CaMKII, whereas CaMKI and CaMKIV have an activation loop",

  "Helper T cells are found in two distinct cell types, Th1 and Th2, distinguished by the cytokines they produce and respond to and the immune responses they are involved in. Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-g, TNF-b and IL-2, while Th2 cells produce the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. The cytokines produced by Th1 cells stimulate the phagocytosis and destruction of microbial pathogens while Th2 cytokines like IL-4 generally stimulate the production of antibodies directed toward large extracellular parasites. IL-5 stimulates eosinophil responses, also part of the immune response toward large extracellular parasites Th1 and Th2 are produced by differentiation from a non-antigen exposed precursor cell type, Thp. Exposure of Thp cells to antigen by antigen-presenting cells may result in their differentiation to Th0 cells, not yet committed to become either Th1 or Th2 cells, although the existence of Th0 cells is controversial. Cells committed as either Th1 and Th2 cells are called polarized, whether they are effector cells actively secreting cytokines or are memory cells. The stimulation of Thp cells",
  "Many cell-surface receptors induce production of second messengers like PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, that convey signals to the cytoplasm from the cell surface. PIP3 signals activates the kinase PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, which in turn activates the kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B. Proteins phosphorylated by activated AKT promote cell survival. Phosphorylation of Ikappa-B kinase leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-kB to oppose apoptosis. Bad is a protein in the Bcl-2 gene family that opposes Bcl-2 to induce apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Bad by AKT blocks anti-apoptotic activity to promote cell survival. Similarly, phosphorylation of the protease caspase 9 or forkhead transcription factors by AKT block the induction of apoptosis by these factors. AKT promotes cell survival and opposes apoptosis by a variety of routes.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled mechanisms of cell death involved in the regulation of tissue homeostasis. The 2 major pathways of apoptosis are the extrinsic (Fas and other TNFR superfamily members and ligands) and the intrinsic (mitochondria-associated) pathways, both of which are found in the cytoplasm. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by death receptor engagement, which initiates a signaling cascade mediated by caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 both feeds directly into caspase-3 activation and stimulates the release of cytochrome c by the mitochondria. Caspase-3 activation leads to the degradation of cellular proteins necessary to maintain cell survival and integrity. The intrinsic pathway occurs when various apoptotic stimuli trigger the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (independently of caspase-8 activation). Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to promote the activation of caspase-3. Recent studies point to the ER as a third subcellular compartment implicated in apoptotic execution. Alterations in Ca2 + homeostasis and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER cause ER stress. Prolonged ER stress can result in the activation of BAD and / or caspase-12, and execute apoptosis.",
  "Glutamatergic-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production occurs via the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) -neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) ternary complex. The increased intracellular Ca2 + stimulates the interaction of nNOS and calmodulin (CaM) and the translocaton of nNOS from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The dephosphorylation of nNOS by Calcineurin catalyzes the conversion of arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), which turns on guanylate cyclase and the various cGMP regulated signaling pathways.",
  "Clot formation and fibrinolysis is a balance of plasmin activation / inhibition and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity that regulates fibrin polymer formation and degradation. Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by",
  "mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appears to play a central role in signaling caused by nutrients and mitogens such as growth factors to regulate translation. The drug rapamycin acts on mammalian cells through the mTOR protein kinase, also known as FRAP. When bound to the immunophilin binding protein FKBP12, rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity and has immunosuppressant activity. Rapamycin and the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 are being tested as anti-cancer agents, acting to block mitogenic signaling. Recently, mTOR was also found to act as an ATP sensor to regulate cell growth. Upstream activation of PI 3 kinase activity that leads to oncogenic transformation can be blocked by inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. Growth factor receptors first stimulate PI 3 kinase, and through inositol phosphates activate PDK-1 and AKT (protein kinase B). AKT phosphorylates mTOR. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP by mTOR and the phosphorylation downstream of RPS6 and EIF-4B stimulate translational initiation and contribute to cell growth.",
  "Interleukin-3 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells through binding to its receptor.

  "D4-GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) is a negative regulator of the ras related Rho Family of GTPases. Since the rho GTPases promote cytoskeletal and membrane changes associated with apoptotic cell death, the removal of the D4-GDI block through its cleavage is important for inducing apoptosis. Caspase-3 cleaves the 28 kDa mature form of D4-GDI to give a 5 kDa and 23 kDa Size fragment. The 23 kDa fragment then translocates to the nucleus. The mechanisms involving cleavage of D4-GDI with apoptosis are not presently known. Activation of the Jun N-Terminal kinase, a regulator of apoptosis, may be one of the mechanisms.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a14) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and / or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.",
  "E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2 / cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2 / cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2 / cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S / G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical,",
  "Xenopus oocytes are naturally arrested at G2 of meiosis I. Exposure to either insulin / IGF-1 or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks this arrest and induces resumption of the two meiotic division cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg. This process is termed oocyte maturation. The transition is accompanied by an increase in maturation promoting factor (MPF or Cdc2 / cyclin B) which precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Most reports point towards the Mos-MEK1-ERK2 pathway and the polo-like kinase / CDC25 pathway as responsible for the activation of MPF in meiosis, most likely triggered by a decrease in cAMP.",
  "Oxidative stress is one factor that can trigger programmed cell death. Activated neutrophils responding to inflammatory stimulation produce reactive oxygen species like superoxide free radicals to kill invading bacteria, but these reactive oxygen species can also attack endothelial cells lining the vascular wall and trigger apoptosis. Endothelial cells also produce reactive oxygen species inside the cell that can contribute to oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as during reperfusion injury following ischemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts highly reactive and damaging superoxide free radicals to peroxides that are less reactive than superoxide but stimulate apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) peptide reducing agent removes toxic metabolites and repairs damage created by reactive oxygen species. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), for example, removes peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent, and glutathione reductase (GSR) regenerates reduced glutathione. Inside the endothelial cell peroxide can be converted to hydroxyl ions in the presence of iron. Peroxides and hydroxyl radicals activate NF-kB and activate expression of inflammatory genes including adhesion molecules, TNF and IL-8. The apoptotic response of endothelial cells to oxidative stress may be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",
  "Interactions between cells responsible for cell to cell adhesion also can communicate signals into the cellular interior, often involving interactions with cytoskeletal elements to produce changes in cell motility, migration, proliferation and shape. The cadherins are cell surface adhesion molecules that help form tight junctions between cells such as formation of epithelial cell layers. E-cadherin inactivation has been implicated in cancer development. In addition to mediating adhesion with other cells, cadherins transduce signals into cells through interactions with the catenins. Catenins probably affect actin cytoskeletal function through interactions with proteins like actinin and vinculin. Catenins also probably trigger changes in cell shape and motility with signals through the Rho small GTPases. Another important cell adhesion molecule is CD-31, or PECAM-1, involved in the formation of junctions between endothelial cells, cell migration, migration of lymphocytes, and regulation of lymphocyte activation. Src phosphorylates PECAM-1 on tyrosine residues causing SHP-2 association with PECAM-1. Paxillin acts as an adaptor protein between proteins involved in adhesion signaling like FAK and src and cytoskeletal elements. In addition to signals created by adhesion molecules to alter cellular responses, other signaling",
  "CTCF is central to signaling pathways in immature B cells elicited by cross-linking the Ig BCR and stimulation with TGF. Both stimuli result in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. BCR ligation stimulates a transient induction of MYC that leads to high level CTCF expression and feedback suppression of MYC transcription. BCR ligation also activates PTEN opposing PI3K activation of MYC. Pharmacologic inactivation of PI3K or mTOR / FRAP results in suppression of S6K resulting in activation of CTCF and suppression of MYC. CTCF activation induces transcriptional activation of p19ARF, with its downstream consequences, and of p27. Growth arrest is occasioned by co-expression of p21 and p27 and inhibition of MYC. CTCF, is bona fide multivalent DNA-sequence binder which specificity is mediated by different sets of zinc fingers (ZFs). For three different DNA target sites, particular groups of ZFs which cannot be deleted from the 11 ZF domain without loosing binding to a given site, are shown by a rainbow in the box on the left.",
  "HIV infection is associated with immunosuppression caused by a dramatic reduction in the helper T cell population. The loss of helper T cells may be caused by HIV-induced apoptosis of both infected and uninfected helper T cells. HIV uses the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor for macrophage cell entry and upregulates fas-ligand on these cells. CD4 on helper T cells is essential for viral cell entry and infection. Cross-linking of CD4 on the T cell surface may be involved in upregulation of Fas and sensitization of T cells to apoptosis induced by the Fas / Fas-ligand interaction.",
  "The mammalian calpain gene family currently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. (An excellent introduction to the calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http: / / ag.arizona.edu / calpains / index.html) One of the most carefully studied functions of the calpains is the regulation of integrin-mediated cell migration. Calpains digests the links between the actin cytoskeleton and several focal adhesion complex proteins; talin, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. The release from the focal adhesion complex facilitates migration. Calpestatin is an inhibitor expressed in most cells. Calpestatin binds the four inhibitory domains of calpain. Release from calpestatin does not activate calpain. Activation requires additional signaling, coactivators and an appropriate calcium concentration. During cell migration calpain1 (mu-calpain) acts at the leading edge as a response to integrin signals or calcium fluxuations due to the stretch activated calcium channels. Calpain1 cleaves the target proteins, talin, exzrin, paxillin and the cytoplasmic tail of the",
  "The chromatin packaging of the genome is dynamic, changing with the cell cycle and with transcriptional regulation. During mitosis, chromatin is condensed for segregation of chromosomes, while for transcription chromatin is more open. The nuclear matrix, or scaffold, is a protein network in the nucleus providing structure and regulating chromatin condensation. Regulated interactions of matrix proteins with each other, DNA and other factors in different phases of the cell cycle alter the structure and function of chromatin. AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein) is a nuclear matrix associated protein that also binds DNA and different proteins during different phases of the cell cycle. The interaction of AKAP95 with DNA and proteins alters the condensation and transcription of chromatin. A specific domain of AKAP95 regulates its interaction with the nuclear matrix and another regulates its association with DNA. One key protein that AKAP95 interacts with is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. AKAP95 binds to PKA through a PKA RII regulatory subunit, an interaction that requires PKA phosphorylation by Cdk1. PKA activity and cAMP are reduced during entry into mitosis, but PKA recruited by AKAP",
  "The defects in cAMP-regulated chloride channel CTFR are believed to be the major cause for cystic fibrosis. Regulation of CFTR protein by the surface receptor beta adrenergic receptor is mediated through the ezrin / radixin / moesin binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), which binds both the C-termini CFTR and b2AR through their PDZ binding motifs. In the resting state, CFTR, b2AR, and EBP50 exist as a macromolecular complex on the apical surface of epithelial cells. Upon agonist activation of the b2AR, the adenulate cyclase is stimulated through the G protein pathway, leading to an increase in cAMP. The elevated concentration of cAMP activates PKA, which is anchored near CFTR via interaction with Ezrin. The phosphorylation of CFTR by PKA disrupts the complex and leads to compartmentalized and specific signaling of the channel.",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates",
  "Apoptosis is specifically induced via signaling through a family of receptors known collectively as' death receptors' including Fas, TNFR, DR3, -4 and -5. Death receptor ligands characteristically initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascades. Apo3L recruits initiator caspase 8 via the adapter protein FADD. Caspase 8 then oligomerizes and is activated via autocatalysis. Activated caspase 8 stimulates apoptosis via two parallel cascades: it directly cleaves and activates caspase-3, and it cleaves Bid (a Bcl-2 family protein). Truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria, inducing cytochrome C release, which sequentially activates caspases 9 and 3. DR-3L can deliver pro- or anti-apoptotic signals. DR-3 promote apoptosis via the adaptor proteins TRADD / FADD and the activation of caspase 8. Alternatively, apoptosis inhibited via an adaptor protein complex including RIP which activates NF-kB and induces survival genes including IAP. Induction of apoptosis via Apo2L requires caspase activity, but the adaptor requirement is unclear.",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mechanism to recognize and repair bulky DNA damage caused by compounds, environmental carcinogens, and exposure to UV-light. In humans hereditary defects in the NER pathway are linked to at least three diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The repair of damaged DNA involves at least 30 polypeptides within two different sub-pathways of NER known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR-NER) and global genome repair (GGR-NER). TCR refers to the expedited repair of lesions located in the actively transcribed strand of genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). In GGR-NER the first step of damage recognition involves XPC-hHR23B complex together with XPE complex (in prokaryotes, uvrAB complex). The following steps of GGR-NER and TCR-NER are similar.",
  "The pentose phosphate pathway is a process of glucose turnover that produces NADPH as reducing equivalents and pentoses as essential parts of nucleotides. There are two different phases in the pathway. One is irreversible oxidative phase in which glucose-6P is converted to ribulose-5P by oxidative decarboxylation, and NADPH is generated. The other is reversible non-oxidative phase in which phosphorylated sugars are interconverted to generate xylulose-5P, ribulose-5P, and ribose-5P. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) formed from ribose-5P is an activated compound used in the biosynthesis of histidine and purine / pyrimidine nucleotides. This pathway map also shows the Entner-Doudoroff pathway where 6-P-gluconate is dehydrated and then cleaved into pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3P.",
  "Progesterone (Pg) binds to both intracellular iPR and plasma membrane- bound mPR. (Right Top) After binding to Pg, iPR is recruited to the membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase p60c- src, which induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in activation of p90Rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Myt1, which favors formation of the activated cell cycle complex cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 causes breakdown of the germinal vesicle and the initiation of oocyte maturation. (Left). In contrast, binding of Pg to mPR leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through activation of Gi or inhibition of Gs. This leads to a decrease in the cAMPdependent kinase PKA, which relieves inhibition of Cdc25C (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cyclin B-Cdc2) and also indirectly promotes the activation of MAPK signaling. PKA also regulates the initiation of oocyte maturation through other effects that are independent of PKA activity.",
  "Leukocyte migaration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation. During this diapedesis of leukocytes, the leukocytes bind to endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM) and then migrate across the vascular endothelium. A leukocyte adherent to CAMs on the endothelial cells moves forward by leading-edge protrusion and retraction of its tail. In this process, alphaL / beta2 integrin activates through Vav1, RhoA, which subsequently activates the kinase p160ROCK. ROCK activation leads to MLC phosphorylation, resulting in retraction of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Leukocytes activate endothelial cell signals that stimulate endothelial cell retraction during localized dissociation of the endothelial cell junctions. ICAM-1-mediated signals activate an endothelial cell calcium flux and PKC, which are required for ICAM-1 dependent leukocyte migration. VCAM-1 is involved in the opening of the endothelial passage through which leukocytes can extravasate. In this regard, VCAM-1 ligation induces NADPH oxidase activation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a Rac-mediated manner, with subsequent activation of matrix metallopoteinases and loss of VE-cadherin-mediated",
  "The Fc Epsilon Receptor 1 signaling pathway in mast cells uses multiple core signal path to achieve its necessary ends. Through the BTK protein and PKC Mast cells are able to degranulate, through the PKC and MAPK paths the cells are able to alter cytokine expression and arachidonic acid release.",
  "Bone density and structure is maintained through a balance of bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone deposition by osteoblasts. The combination of simultaneous resorption and deposition creates continual remodeling of bone while excess osteoclast activity leads to an imbalance and a loss of bone density, causing osteoporosis. RANK (receptor activator of NF-kB ligand) is a receptor in the TNF receptor gene family that is involved in osteoclast differentiation. RANK-ligand, also called osteoprotegerin-ligand, binds to RANK, induces receptor dimerization, and activates downstream signaling. Osteoprotegerin is a decoy receptor for RANK-ligand that suppresses osteoclast activity and bone remodeling, helping to maintain balanced bone remodeling. RANK-ligand and osteoprotegerin are produced by osteoblasts and some factors regulate osteoclast activity indirectly through their action on the expression of these factors by osteoblasts. Binding of RANK-ligand to RANK activates signaling through TRAF-6. TRAF-6 induces several downstream signaling events, including activation of NF-kB, c-Fos and the kinase JNK1. Jnk-1 activation contribute to fos activation by RANK-ligand and may be involved in the modulation of RANK-ligand by other factors such as estrogen",
  "The appropriate signaling through the insulin pathway is critical for the regulation of glucose levels and the avoidance of diabetes. Insulin forms a complex with the Insulin Receptor (IR) and b chains to form the active signaling complex. Through recruitment of adaptor molecules and the activation of RAS, the activated IR can cause transcriptional activation.",
  "Mef2 pathway.",
  "Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling pathways in mast cells are initiated by the interaction of antigen (Ag) with IgE bound to the extracellular domain of the alpha chain of Fc epsilon RI. The activation pathways are regulated both positively and negatively by the interactions of numerous signaling molecules. Mast cells that are thus activated release preformed granules which contain biogenic amines (especially histamines) and proteoglycans (especially heparin). The activation of phospholipase A2 causes the release of membrane lipids followed by development of lipid mediators such as leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) and prostaglandins (especially PDG2). There is also secretion of cytokines, the most important of which are TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5. These mediators and cytokines contribute to inflammatory responses.",
  "Significant progress has been made towards delineation of the intrinsic molecular processes that regulate B lymphocyte immune function. Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc-gamma-R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.",
  "The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in macrophages are activated by their peptide ligands and also by the HIV envelope protein GP120 during HIV infection. One mechanism of signaling by these GPCRs is through activation of Gi signaling. These chemokine receptors can also signal through a Gi-independent pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. This pathway elevates calcium influx into the cell through CRAC channels, ion channels that are activated by calcium release. Elevated calcium from CRAC is required for downstream activation of Pyk2, a focal adhesion-associated protein kinase. Non Gi signaling by these chemokine receptors also involves the Jnk and p38 Map kinase pathways leading to AP-1 activation and activation of genes such as MIP-1 and MCP-1. This pathway may be involved in the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of AIDS.",

  "Bile acids are steroid carboxylic acids derived from cholesterol in vertebrates. The primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are synthesized in the liver and conjugated with taurine or glycine before secretion via bile into the intestine. The conversion from cholesterol to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids involves four steps: 1) the initiation of synthesis by 7alpha-hydroxylation of sterol precursors, 2) further modifications to the ring structures, 3) side-chain oxidation and shortening (cleavage) by three carbons, and 4) conjugation of the bile acid with taurine or glycine.",
  "mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) appears to play a central role in signaling caused by nutrients and mitogens such as growth factors to regulate translation. The drug rapamycin acts on mammalian cells through the mTOR protein kinase, also known as FRAP. When bound to the immunophilin binding protein FKBP12, rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity and has immunosuppressant activity. Rapamycin and the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 are being tested as anti-cancer agents, acting to block mitogenic signaling. Recently, mTOR was also found to act as an ATP sensor to regulate cell growth. Upstream activation of PI 3 kinase activity that leads to oncogenic transformation can be blocked by inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. Growth factor receptors first stimulate PI 3 kinase, and through inositol phosphates activate PDK-1 and AKT (protein kinase B). AKT phosphorylates mTOR. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP by mTOR and the phosphorylation downstream of RPS6 and EIF-4B stimulate translational initiation and contribute to cell growth.",
  "Cdk5 is a cyclin dependent protein kinase involved in dopaminergic signaling in the neostriatal region of the brain. The role of cdk5 in dopamine responses occurs through phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Caseine kinase 1 (CK1) also regulates DARPP-32 phosphorylation and dopamine signaling. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by cdk5 reduced dopamine signaling. Depending on its phosphorylation state, DARPP-32 inhibits either protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or PKA. The role of mGLUR1 in this process is supported by the induction of cdk5 and CK1 activity by the mGLUR1 agonist DHPG and the subsequent phosphorylation of DARPP-32 associated with DHPG treatment of nigrostriatal neurons. CK-1 and Ckd5 inhibitors block the DHPG induced DARPP-32 phosphorylation. Dopamine exerts a positive signal that increases dopamine response by reversing phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at threonine-75. Dopamine initiates this pathway through activation of the D1 dopamine receptor, a Gs coupled GPCR, elevating cAMP and activating PKA. PKA activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which dephosphorylates DARPP-32 and increases dopamine responsiveness. This also removes",
  "Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts at synapses through binding to ligand-gated ion channels, the GABA receptors. Clustering of the GABA-A receptor chloride channel alters receptor pharmacology on the cell surface and reduced clustering of the GABA receptor is associated with anxiety. GABA-A interacts with several proteins that modulate its clustering, endocytosis, and recycling or degradation. Plic-1 is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to GABA-A receptors and causes them to accumulate at inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of GABA-A, and with microtubules, bringing receptors together in plasma microdomains. Curiously, Gephyrin appears to be a bifunctional protein, with a domain involved in molybdenum metabolism. Another protein interacting with the GABA-A receptor is GABARAP, a microtubule-associated protein. Anchoring of the GABA-A receptor to GABARAP helps to cluster the receptor at the synaptic termini and to mediate fast synaptic transmission. GABARAP may mediate interaction of gephyrin with the GABA-A receptor and gephyrin may stabilize clusters by forming multimeric structures. GABARAP and gephyrin may play more",
  "Several forms of post-translational modification regulate protein activities. Recently, protein methylation by CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) has been observed to play a key role in transcriptional regulation. CARM1 associates with the p160 class of transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by steroid hormone family receptors. CARM1 also interacts with CBP / p300 transcriptional coactivators involved in gene activation by a large variety of transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors and CEBP. One target of CARM1 is the core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets of the histone acetylase activity of CBP / p300 coactivators. Recruitment of CARM1 to the promoter region by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and makes promoter regions more accessible for transcription. Another target of CARM1 methylation is a coactivator it interacts with, CBP. Methylation of CBP by CARM1 blocks CBP from acting as a coactivator for CREB and redirects the limited CBP pool in the cell to be available for steroid hormone receptors. Other forms of post-translational protein modification such as phosphorylation are reversible in nature, but as of yet a protein demethylase is not known.",
  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. During step 1, the conditioning regimen (irradiation and / or chemotherapy) leads to damage, activation of host tissues and induction of inflammatory cytokines secretion. Increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and adhesion molecules leads to enhancement of the recognition of host MHC and / or minor histocompatibility antigens by mature donor T cells. Donor T-cell activation in step II is characterized by the predominance of Th1 cells and the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. These cytokines induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which leaks through the intestinal mucosa that was damaged during step 1, together with IFN-gamma, from step 2, further stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines and NO. During step 3, the effector",

  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) provide a potent proliferative signaling system that stimulates growth in many different cell types and blocks apoptosis. In vivo IGF-1 acts as an intermediate of many growth hormone responses, and may stimulate the growth of some types of cancer. IGF-1 also provides a mitogenic signal to act as a growth factor for many tissue culture cells. One component of IGF-1 mitogenic signaling is association of the receptor tyrosine kinase with Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1 to activate ras and the Map kinase cascade (raf, Mek, Erk). An endpoint of the Map kinase pathway is modification of transcription factor activity, such as activation of ELK transcription factors. Serum response factor (SRF) and AP-1 contribute to mitogenic signaling by many factors. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI3 kinase activation are also involved in IGF-1 signaling, similar to insulin signaling.",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of a complex mixture of structural and functional macromolecules and serves an important role in tissue and organ morphogenesis and in the maintenance of cell and tissue structure and function. Specific interactions between cells and the ECM are mediated by transmembrane molecules, mainly integrins and perhaps also proteoglycans, CD36, or other cell-surface-associated components. These interactions lead to a direct or indirect control of cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In addition, integrins function as mechanoreceptors and provide a force-transmitting physical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Integrins are a family of glycosylated, heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that consist of noncovalently bound alpha- and beta-subunits.",
  "The p44 / 42 MAP Kinase pathway consists of a protein kinase cascade linking growth and differentiation signals with transcription in the nucleus. Growth factor receptors and tyrosine kinases activate Ras which in turn activates c-Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. Activated p44 / 42 MAP Kinase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription by phosphorylation of kinases such as p90 RSK, MSK, and transcription factors such as ELK-1 and Stat3. The importance of this pathway in both growth control and development has been demonstrated via the transforming properties of various mutant forms of Ras, Raf, MEK and by their effects on development. Signal amplification and the potential for crosstalk appear to be important features of this regulatory network.",

  "Liver is the major site for carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis and glycogen synthesis) and triglyceride synthesis (lipogenesis). While insulin was long thought to be the major regulator of hepatic gene expression, emerging evidence show that nutrients, in particular, glucose and fatty acids, are also able to regulate hepatic genes. This diagram illustrates how glucose metabolite, rather than glucose itself, contributes to the coordinated regulation of carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis in liver through phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ChREBP (carbohydrate responsive element binding protein). ChREBP is a basic helix-loop helix / leucine zipper (bHLH / LZ) transcription factor, shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a glucose-responsive manner in hepatocytes. When serum glucose is elevated, glucose transporter (GLUT2) and glucokinase (GCK) allow for rapid uptake and equilibration of intracellular glucose levels. This flux of glucose promotes, via the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway (HMP Shunt), the formation of xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu-5-P), which activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to dephosphorylate ChREBP (Ser196) and promote its nuclear localization. PP2A",
  "Activation of the protease-activated GPCRs in platelets contributes to platelet activation in clotting. The protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved by the protease thrombin, releasing a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor and triggers intracellular calcium release. Platelets from mice lacking the PAR4 gene are not activated by thrombin and are impaired in clotting, supporting the importance of thrombin signaling through PAR4 in clotting. Human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, with PAR1 playing a more dominant role in clotting in humans. Calcium release induced by PARs activates PKC, modulating integrin alpha IIB beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb / IIIa) and opening integrin ligand binding sites to contribute to platelet aggregation. Intracellular calcium increases induced by thrombin activates phospholipase A2, liberating arachidonic acid, the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis. Ras / Map kinase activation by the PAR receptors also activates phospholipase A2. The activation of PAR-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by aspirin, indicating that thromboxane production induced by PAR signaling contributes to platelet activation. Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin PGG2 by the enzyme Cox-1 in platelets, and Cox-1 is",
  "A demonstrated means to increase lifespan in a wide range of organisms is through the restriction of caloric intake. Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric",
  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs triggers the assembly of a MAP kinase activation complex using -arrestin as a scaffold, with subsequent activation of a -arrestin-bound pool of ERK1 / 2. The receptor-arrestinERK complexes are localized to endosomal vesicles, and their formation does not result in nuclear translocation of activated ERK1 / 2 or stimulation of cell proliferation. The function of -arrestin-bound ERK1 / 2 is presently unknown. Activation of ERK1 / 2 by -arrestin scaffolds may favor the phosphorylation of plasma membrane, cytosolic, or cytoskeletal ERK1 / 2 substrates, or it may lead to transcriptional activation through the ERK-dependent activation of other kinases. The model depicts -arrestin scaffolding of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade, based upon data obtained with the protease-activated PAR2 and angiotensin AT1a receptors. A similar mechanism has been proposed for regulation of the JNK3 MAP kinase cascade by AT1a receptors.",
  "Skeletal muscle atrophies with disuse while with increased use and increased load skeletal muscle exhibits hypertrophy, with an increase in the size of existing muscle fibers. One signaling pathway involved in regulating skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy is the AKT / mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway activity increases in response to muscle activity during hypertrophy and decreases in activity during atrophy. Blocking this pathway genetically or with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks hypertrophy and genetic activation of the pathway induces hypertrophy. One agent that promotes muscle hypertrophy is the growth factor IGF-1. IGF-1 activates AKT, GSK-3beta and mTOR to promote hypertrophy. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway is not involved in hypertrophy and is down-regulated by agents such as IGF-1 that promote hypertrophy. Calcineurin may modulate other aspects of muscle function such as the development of slow muscle fibers through transcriptional regulation. These pathways lead to regulation of protein translation, with increased translation apparently acting as a key regulatory point in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Agents such as IGF-1 that stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy may provide treatments for muscle atrophy and wasting.",
  "The citrate cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle) is an important aerobic pathway for the final steps of the oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids. The cycle starts with acetyl-CoA, the activated form of acetate, derived from glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation for carbohydrates and from beta oxidation of fatty acids. The two-carbon acetyl group in acetyl-CoA is transferred to the four-carbon compound of oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon compound of citrate. In a series of reactions two carbons in citrate are oxidized to CO2 and the reaction pathway supplies NADH for use in the oxidative phosphorylation and other metabolic processes. The pathway also supplies important precursor metabolites including 2-oxoglutarate. At the end of the cycle the remaining four-carbon part is transformed back to oxaloacetate. According to the genome sequence data, many organisms seem to lack genes for the full cycle, but contain genes for specific segments.",
  "Myocarditis is a cardiac disease associated with inflammation and injury of the myocardium. It results from various etiologies, both noninfectious and infectious, but coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is still considered the dominant etiological agent. Myocarditis may be caused by direct cytopathic effects of virus, a pathologic immune response to persistent virus, or autoimmunity triggered by the viral infection. The virus enters the myocyte through internalization of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) and its coreceptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Viral proteases cleave various proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to apoptosis. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells. CVB",
  "The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "The differentiation of muscle cells is transcriptionally regulated, in part by the myocyte enhancer factor-2, MEF2. During myogenesis MEF2 binds to MyoD and other basic helix-loop-helix factors to activate transcription of genes involved in muscle cell differentiation. Transcriptional activation by MEF2 is blocked by interaction with HDAC5 and other histone deacetylases. In undifferentiated myoblasts, HDAC5 is present in the nucleus where it binds to MEF2 to block activation of muscle genes. When activated by IGF-1 signaling, CaM kinase phosphorylates HDAC proteins, causing them to be exported from the nucleus, releasing the block on MEF2 transcriptional activation and allowing differentiation to proceed. Transcription cofactors also interact with MEF2 to contribute to gene regulation and myogenesis. The transcriptional regulator NFAT, for example, acts as a cofactor for MEF2 when calcium and calcineurin signaling activate it. There are four members of the Mef2 gene family, Mef2a-2d. Mef2a is expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Mef2c is involved in myogenesis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mef2d is widely expressed, and may be involved in the regulation of T cell function as well as muscle",
  "Over 1,000 papers and reviews have been written about the role of ceramide in the production of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Ceramide is a sphingosine-based lipid-signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This diagram represents some of the current understanding of the cascades that couple ceramide to specific signaling pathways. These cascades illustrate that ceramide can be a growth stimulus or proapototic signal. The ultimate ceramide action is determined within the context of other stimuli and by the subcellular topology of its production and is cell-type specific. There are 2 forms of sphingomyelinase, acid (acid-sphingomyelinase: A-SMase) and neutral (neutral-sphingomyelinase N-SMase), that can produce ceramide. TNF-alpha can stimulate either form of sphingomyelinase as can other death receptors. Different domanis of TNF-alpha stimulate the different Smases. N-SMase stimulation is enhanced by the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1). The activity of each form is dependent on the local intracellular pH. In the illustration the forms are seperated to reduce confusion however",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM (familial DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of familial DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an idiopathic DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of idiopathic DCM focus on chronic viral myocarditis and / or on autoimmune abnormalities. Viral myocarditis may progress to an autoimmune phase and then to progressive cardiac dilatation. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with idiopathic DCM, may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2 +, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.",
  "The IL-2 receptor is a key component of immune signaling and is required for the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. This receptor is composed of three polypeptide chains, the alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2 receptor gamma chain is a common component for several other cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. The IL-2 receptor beta chain is essential for IL-2 signaling and is also a component of the IL-15 receptor complex. The polypeptides of the IL-2 receptor do not themselves have intrinsic catalytic activity, but interact with cytoplasmic signaling proteins to transduce signals. br > Different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor beta chain interact and couple with distinct signaling pathways and cellular responses. JAK1 associates with the beta chain, and JAK3 with the gamma chain. Binding of IL-2 induces heterodimerization of receptor subunits, and activation of JAK kinase activity. Tyrosine residues in the beta chain cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated during activation, recruiting other factors to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues through src homology 2 (SH2) domains",
  "The T Cell Receptor plays a key role in the immune system. The specificity of the receptor is governed by the binding site formed from the mature alpha and beta chains (shown here) or gamma and delta chains in gamma / delta T Cells. It is the ability of this receptor to bind a complex of foreign peptide in the groove of an MHC molecule that leads to T cell activation. Upon activation the T cell can assist in activating other cells or carry out cytolytic attacks depending on the particular T cell type. The CD3 complex and CD4 (Th cells) or CD8 (Tc cells) work to transmit the activation signal to the T cell's transcriptional machinary upon engagement of the receptor.",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a crucial role in development of diverse animal phyla, from Drosophila to humans, regulating morphogenesis of a variety of tissues and organs. Hh signaling is also involved in control of stem cell proliferation in adult tissues and aberrant activation of the Hh pathway has been linked to multiple types of human cancer. Members of the Hh family bind to patched (ptc), thus releasing smoothened (smo) to transduce a signal. Transcriptional activation occurs through the GLI family of proteins resulting in activation of target genes.",
  "Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps known as G1 and G2 phases. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage, the checkpoint kinase ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. p5",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells serving as the cell's main digestive compartment to which all sorts of macromolecules are delivered for degradation. They contain more than 40 hydrolases in an acidic environment (pH of about 5). After synthesis in the ER, lysosomal enzymes are decorated with mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network. They are packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to late endosomes. Substances for digestion are acquired by the lysosomes via a series of processes including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a broad range of cellular and physiological responses. In addition to playing a role in inflammation and hematopoiesis, IL-6 is involved in other processes such as neuronal differentiation and bone loss. To produce these effects IL-6 signals through a receptor composed of two different subunits, an alpha subunit that produces ligand specificity and gp130, a receptor subunit shared in common with other cytokines in the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT3, that move into the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing STAT3 response elements. The ras-mediated pathway, acting through Shc, Grb-2 and Sos-1 upstream and activating Map kinases downstream, activates transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-IL-6 (C / EBP-beta) that can act through their own cognate response elements in the genome. These factors and other transcription factors like AP-1 and SRF (",
  "Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF / CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF / CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the Endo",
  "Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the",
  "For a T cell to be activated by a specific antigen, the T cell receptor must recognize complexes of MHCI with the antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. T cells and the T cell receptor complex do not respond to antigen in solution, but even for the specific antigen they only respond to antigen-MHC-1 complexes on the cell surface. This interaction is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. T cell activation also requires a co-stimulatory signal involving interaction of CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 family genes) on the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 activates a signal transduction pathway acting through PI-3K, Lck and Grb-2 / ITK to provide its co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation. Another means to control T cell activation is by expressing factors that down-regulate T cell activation. Signaling by activated T cell receptors induces expression of CTLA-4, a receptor that opposes T cell activation. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity than CD28 for B7 proteins, terminating T cell activation.",
  "Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in eukaryotic cellular processes. It mainly functions as a signal for 26S proteasome dependent protein degradation. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins being degraded is performed by a reaction cascade consisting of three enzymes, named E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). Each E3 has specificity to its substrate, or proteins to be targeted by ubiquitination. Many E3s are discovered in eukaryotes and they are classified into four types: HECT type, U-box type, single RING-finger type, and multi-subunit RING-finger type. Multi-subunit RING-finger E3s are exemplified by cullin-Rbx E3s and APC / C. They consist of a RING-finger-containing subunit (RBX1 or RBX2) that functions to bind E2s, a scaffold-like cullin molecule, adaptor proteins, and a target recognizing subunit that binds substrates.",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.",
  "The vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is a highly specialized cell whose principal function is contraction. On contraction, VSMCs shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure. The principal mechanisms that regulate the contractile state of VSMCs are changes in cytosolic Ca2 + concentration (c). In response to vasoconstrictor stimuli, Ca2 + is mobilized from intracellular stores and / or the extracellular space to increase c in VSMCs. The increase in c, in turn, activates the Ca2 + -CaM-MLCK pathway and stimulates MLC20 phosphorylation, leading to myosin-actin interactions and, hence, the development of contractile force. The sensitivity of contractile myofilaments or MLC20 phosphorylation to Ca2 + can be secondarily modulated by other signaling pathways. During receptor stimulation, the contractile force is greatly enhanced by the inhibition of myosin phosphatase. Rho / Rho kinase, PKC, and arachidonic acid have been proposed to play a pivotal role in this enhancement. The signaling events that mediate relaxation include the removal of a contractile agonist (passive relaxation) and activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in the continued presence of a",
  "Interactions between cells responsible for cell to cell adhesion also can communicate signals into the cellular interior, often involving interactions with cytoskeletal elements to produce changes in cell motility, migration, proliferation and shape. The cadherins are cell surface adhesion molecules that help form tight junctions between cells such as formation of epithelial cell layers. E-cadherin inactivation has been implicated in cancer development. In addition to mediating adhesion with other cells, cadherins transduce signals into cells through interactions with the catenins. Catenins probably affect actin cytoskeletal function through interactions with proteins like actinin and vinculin. Catenins also probably trigger changes in cell shape and motility with signals through the Rho small GTPases. Another important cell adhesion molecule is CD-31, or PECAM-1, involved in the formation of junctions between endothelial cells, cell migration, migration of lymphocytes, and regulation of lymphocyte activation. Src phosphorylates PECAM-1 on tyrosine residues causing SHP-2 association with PECAM-1. Paxillin acts as an adaptor protein between proteins involved in adhesion signaling like FAK and src and cytoskeletal elements. In addition to signals created by adhesion molecules to alter cellular responses, other signaling",
  "Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells",
  "The p44 / 42 MAP Kinase pathway consists of a protein kinase cascade linking growth and differentiation signals with transcription in the nucleus. Growth factor receptors and tyrosine kinases activate Ras which in turn activates c-Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. Activated p44 / 42 MAP Kinase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription by phosphorylation of kinases such as p90 RSK, MSK, and transcription factors such as ELK-1 and Stat3. The importance of this pathway in both growth control and development has been demonstrated via the transforming properties of various mutant forms of Ras, Raf, MEK and by their effects on development. Signal amplification and the potential for crosstalk appear to be important features of this regulatory network.",
  "Her2 or ERBB2 belongs to a class of proteins having high homology with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ERBB1). It encodes a protein with the molecular weight of 185 KDa. Unlike other members of EGFR family, no ligand for Her2 has been found and it usually associates with members of ERBB1 family to form functional heterodimers. It has been shown that it can form dimers with ERBB (EGFR), ERBB3 and ERBB4 as well as gp130 subunits of IL-6 receptor. In at least some cell types, the association between gp130 and HRBB2 is essential for HRBB2-ERBB3 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP kinase signaling. Although ERBB1 can form homodimers, the signaling for ERBB1 is usually transient and the receptor undergoes internalization after ligand binding and activation. EGFR-HER2 complex increases the signaling capacity of EGFR by increasing the ligand affinity as well as the recycling of the heterodimer. Of all the ERBB heterodimers, ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimers perhaps elicit the strongest signal. Removing ERBB3 from the cell has a drastic effect on ERBB2 mediated signaling and downstream effectors.

  "The PML nuclear bodies are ring-shaped nuclear substructures associated with the regulation of transcription, transformation, cell growth, and apoptosis and are characterized by the presence of the protein PML. The activities of PML as a tumor suppressor and apoptosis inducing factor are exerted through the numerous proteins it interacts with in the PML-nuclear bodies including the tumor suppressor p53. DNA damage induced activation of p53-dependent apoptosis requires PML. PML acts as a coactivator for p53 and increases acetylation of p53 by the transcriptional coactivator CBP. This acetylation of p53 is reversed by the deacetylase SirT1, the human homolog of the yeast gene Sir2, and this deacetylation opposes the transcriptional activation of p53. The tumor suppressor Rb also interacts with the PML nuclear body, increasing transcriptional repression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, suggesting that PML may affect cellular transformation through more than one mechanism. PML interacts directly with Ubc9, which modifies PML through the attachment of the ubiquitin-like peptide Sumo-1. Sumo-1 modification of PML is not necessary for the nuclear bodies to form, but may",
  "The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) encodes a protein kinase that acts as a tumor suppressor. ATM activation by ionizing radiation damage to DNA stimulates DNA repair and blocks progression through the cell cycle. Mutation of the ATM gene causes the disease ataxia telangiectasia which which involves an inherited predisposition to some cancers. To play this role ATM interacts with a broad network of proteins, including checkpoint factors (chk1, chk2), tumor suppressors (p53 and BRCA), DNA repair factors (RAD50, RAD51, GADD45), and other signaling molecules (c-Abl and NF-kB). In addition to regulating DNA repair and the cell cycle, ATM can also trigger apoptosis in radiation treated cells.",
  "Regulation of T cell activation is a crucial component of balanced functioning of the immune system. If the T cell response is too great and activation of self-responsive cells or unstimulated cells is not suppressed, then autoimmune disorders or tissue injury can result. Unstimulated T cells are maintained in a quiescent state and the activity of self-reactive T cells is maintained in an anergic state in which IL-2 expression is repressed. IL-2 is a cytokine with a key role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The maintenance of T cells in the anergic or unstimulated state may not involve just an absence of activation, but an active repression of IL-2 expression, T cell proliferation and activation. TGF beta may play a role in suppressing T cell activation. Tob is a factor identified recently that represses T cell activation that is a member of a family of genes with anti-proliferative properties. Tob expression is highest in unstimulated and anergic T cells, and is reduced in activated T cells. Tob interacts with the TGF activated transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD4, increasing their binding to the IL-2 promoter",
  "TNFR2 is the receptor for the 171 amino acid 19 kD TNF (beta) (a.k.a. lymphotoxin). TNF (beta) is produced by activated lymphocytes and can be cytotoxic to many tumor and other cells. In neutrophils, endothelial cells and osteoclasts TNF (beta) can lead to activation while in many other cell types it can lead to increased expression of MHC and adhesion molecules.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.",
  "Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The extrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to vascular walls or extravascular tissues. The damaged tissue releases tissue thromboplastin also known as tissue factor (TF). The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes as little as 15 seconds. This cascade is initiated by the activation of factor X by TF and factor VII. Activated factor X combined with factor V, factor VII and TF constitutes the prothrombin activator. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for each of these steps. The prothrombin activator in the extrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the intrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also the step leading to the activation of factor X. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin.

  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs coincides with the recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases, including c-Src, Hck and c-Fgr (Src-TK), to the receptor-arrestin complex. Several signaling events have been reported to involve -arrestin-dependent Src recruitment. These include the regulation of clathrin-dependent 2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis by tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, Ras-dependent activation of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade and stimulation of cell proliferation by 2-adrenergic and neurokinin NK1 receptors, and stimulation of chemokine CXCR1 receptor-mediated neutrophil degranulation",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specifically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a14) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and / or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.",
  "The drug Gleevec (also known as imatinib mesylate or STI-571) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of CML, chronic myeloid leukemia. While traditional cytotoxic cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy kill all dividing cells, Gleevec acts on a molecular target by a mechanism that is more specific to cancer cells. Traditional cytotoxic cancer agents have serious side effects such as nausea, weight loss, hair loss and severe fatigue that result from their lack of specificity in killing cells. Gleevec was designed as an inhibitor of a specific receptor associated with CML, and so produces less severe side effects than other cancer agents. CML is associated in most cases with a specific chromosomal defect, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation occurs at the site in the genome of a protein tyrosine kinase called abl, creating the abnormal bcr-abl protein, a fusion of the abl gene with another gene called bcr. The kinase activity of abl in the bcr-abl fusion is activated and unregulated, driving the uncontrolled cell growth observed in CML. White",
  "The hepatocyte growth factor receptor, also called c-Met, is activated by HGF and stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes and other cell types. Mutated forms of the HGF receptor are associated with oncogenesis and metastasis, making the HGF receptor a potential therapeutic target for cancer drugs. Changes in cell motility, cell shape, adhesion, resistance to apoptosis, and anchorage independent growth all contribute to the role of c-Met in cancer. The HGF receptor is a heterodimer with tyrosine kinase activity and associates with a multiprotein complex involved in downstream signal transduction. The HGF receptor can associate with several different signaling systems, including src, Grb2 / SOS, PI3 kinase and Gab1. One of the major substrates of the activated HGF receptor tyrosine kinase is the adaptor protein Gab1. Gab1 interacts with Crk and CrkL, two proteins with SH2 and SH3 protein interaction domains that couple to signaling further downstream. The actions of HGF on paxillin, DOCK180 and Rap1 mediated through GAB1 and other members of this complex alter cell motility. Regulation of Rho, Rac1 and CDC42 pathways in response to HGF all contribute to changes in cellular motility. Another target of",
  "The scanning translation initiation model suggests that 40S ribosomal subunit preloaded with factors bind to the 5 end of the mRNA near the cap. The 48S subunit moves along the mRNA until it finds the initiation triplet and in complex with tRNA and 60S subunit formed the first peptide bond. Translation control is mostly regulated at the protein initiation step through translation initiation factors such as eIF2 or eIF4.",
  "Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells",
  "Bladder cancer arise and progress along two distinctive pathways. The first of these is often preceded by simple and papillary hyperplasia and exhibits a tumour morphology that is low-grade, superficial and papillary. Papillary carcinoma has a tendency to recur locally, but rarely invades and metastasizes. These tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. The second tumour pathway is characterized by high-grade muscle-invasive tumours, which either originate from flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) / severe dysplasia or arise de novo. Over half of these tumours show defects in the tumour suppressors p53 and / or the retinoblastoma protein (RB) genes and pathways, and over 50% of these tumours progress to local and distant metastases. Some of the cell cycle-related molecules show evidence of epigenetic modulation through aberrant promoter hypermethylation in invasive bladder cancer. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors",
  "Cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs), the most common type of intercellular adhesions, are important for maintaining tissue architecture and cell polarity and can limit cell movement and proliferation. At AJs, E-cadherin serves as an essential cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cytoplasmic tail binds beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is associated with F-actin bundles directly and indirectly. The integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of beta-catenin by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Fer, Fyn, Yes, and Src), which leads to dissociation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Integrity of this complex is positively regulated by beta -catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase II, and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Changes in the phosphorylation state of beta-catenin affect cell-cell adhesion, cell migration and the level of signaling beta-catenin. Wnt signaling acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin by inhibiting beta-catenin degradation, which stabilizes beta-catenin, and causes its accumulation. Cadherin may acts as a negative regulator",
  "The glycolytic pathway begins with the simple sugar glucose and leads to pyruvate and eventually the Kreb's cycle. Dietary carbohydrates include a variety of sugars that are funneled into glycolysis to supply energy, including other monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides like starch. Fructose is an abundant monosaccharide in fruit, and is also found along with glucose in the common disaccharide sucrose. Fructose enters glycolysis by different pathways in the liver and muscle. In muscle, fructose is a substrate of hexokinase, like glucose, and enters the pathway directly as fructose 6-phosphate. In liver, hexokinase is present in very low levels and fructose passes through a more complex pathway. Fructose is first phosphorylated to form fructose 1-phosphate, which is then split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to enter glycolysis as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The sugar mannose also enters glycolysis at this point, first being converted to mannose 6-phosphate that is then isomerized to produce fructose 6-phosphate. Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk, and is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose only differs from glucose in its stereochemistry at one position, but",
  "Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. This classification has also been justified at the molecular level with Type 1 tumours being more commonly associated with abnormalities of DNA-mismatch repair genes, K-ras, PTEN and beta-catenin, and Type 2 tumours with abnormalities of p53 and HER2 / neu.",
  "Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.",
  "The amyloid -beta peptide (Ab), a proteolytic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the major componenet of senile plaques, the hallmark of alzhemiers disease. Platelets contain both APP and Ab and probably contribute greater than 90% of circulating APP. The soluble APP is the major inhibitor of coagulation factors IXa and XIa, and platelet aggregation. Agonists such as ADP, thrombin, epinephrine and collagen activate the release of APP and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (an important regulator of coagulation) from platelet storage granules. These important molecules released from platelets are key regulators of hemostasis, the physiologic arrest of hemorrhage at site of vascular leakage.",
  "The intestine is the largest lymphoid tissue in the body. One striking feature of intestinal immunity is its ability to generate great amounts of noninflammatory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies that serve as the first line of defense against microorganisms. The basic map of IgA production includes induction of mucosal B cells in the Peyer's patches, circulation through the bloodstream and homing to intestinal mucosa of IgA-commited plasma cells, and local antibody production for export across the intestinal membranes. Multiple cytokines, including TGF- {beta}, IL-10, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6, are required to promote IgA class switching and terminal differentiation process of the B cells. Secreted IgA promotes immune exclusion by entrapping dietary antigens and microorganisms in the mucus and functions for neutralization of toxins and pathogenic microbes.",

  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a crucial role in development of diverse animal phyla, from Drosophila to humans, regulating morphogenesis of a variety of tissues and organs. Hh signaling is also involved in control of stem cell proliferation in adult tissues and aberrant activation of the Hh pathway has been linked to multiple types of human cancer. Members of the Hh family bind to patched (ptc), thus releasing smoothened (smo) to transduce a signal. Transcriptional activation occurs through the GLI family of proteins resulting in activation of target genes.",
  "Hypoxic stress, like DNA damage, induces p53 protein accumulation and p53-dependent apoptosis in oncogenically transformed cells. Unlike DNA damage, hypoxia does not induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, suggesting that p53 activity is differentially regulated by these two stresses. Hypoxia induces p53 protein accumulation, but in contrast to DNA damage, hypoxia fails to induce endogenous downstream p53 effector mRNAs and proteins, such as p21, Bax, CIP1, WAF1 etc. Hypoxia does not inhibit the induction of p53 target genes by ionizing radiation, indicating that p53-dependent transactivation requires a DNA damage-inducible signal that is lacking under hypoxic treatment alone. The phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. Mdm-2 targets the p53 tumor suppressor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome, but, in addition, the p53 transcription",
  "Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in",
  "The cellular activation of the caspase cascade resulting in cell death is triggered by chemical damage to DNA which stimulates a sequence resulting in the cleavage of Bid in a manner similar to the binding of so called death-receptors or directly initiates the permeability transition of the mitochondrial membrane. The permiability transition releases several factors including cytochrome c, AIF and other factors in to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase cascade. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death.",
  "The mammalian calpain gene family currently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. (An excellent introduction to the calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http: / / ag.arizona.edu / calpains / index.html) One of the most carefully studied functions of the calpains is the regulation of integrin-mediated cell migration. Calpains digests the links between the actin cytoskeleton and several focal adhesion complex proteins; talin, paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. The release from the focal adhesion complex facilitates migration. Calpestatin is an inhibitor expressed in most cells. Calpestatin binds the four inhibitory domains of calpain. Release from calpestatin does not activate calpain. Activation requires additional signaling, coactivators and an appropriate calcium concentration. During cell migration calpain1 (mu-calpain) acts at the leading edge as a response to integrin signals or calcium fluxuations due to the stretch activated calcium channels. Calpain1 cleaves the target proteins, talin, exzrin, paxillin and the cytoplasmic tail of the",
  "The IL-2 receptor is a key component of immune signaling and is required for the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. This receptor is composed of three polypeptide chains, the alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2 receptor gamma chain is a common component for several other cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. The IL-2 receptor beta chain is essential for IL-2 signaling and is also a component of the IL-15 receptor complex. The polypeptides of the IL-2 receptor do not themselves have intrinsic catalytic activity, but interact with cytoplasmic signaling proteins to transduce signals. br > Different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor beta chain interact and couple with distinct signaling pathways and cellular responses. JAK1 associates with the beta chain, and JAK3 with the gamma chain. Binding of IL-2 induces heterodimerization of receptor subunits, and activation of JAK kinase activity. Tyrosine residues in the beta chain cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated during activation, recruiting other factors to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues through src homology 2 (SH2) domains",
  "p38 MAPKs are members of the MAPK family that are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. Stress signals are delivered to this cascade by members of small GTPases of the Rho family (Rac, Rho, Cdc42). As with other MAPK cascades, the membrane-proximal component is a MAPKKK, typically a MEKK or a mixed lineage kinase (MLK). The MAPKKK phosphorylates and activated MKK3 / 5, the p38 MAPK kinase. MKK3 / 6 can also be activated directly by ASK1, which is stimulated by apoptotic stimuli. P38 MAK is involved in regulation of Hsp27 and MAPKAP-2 and several transcription factors including ATF2, STAT1, THE Max / Myc complex, MEF-2, ELK-1 and indirectly CREB via activation of MSK1.",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved biological pathway that plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations from becoming permanent in dividing cells. MMR also suppresses homologous recombination and was recently shown to play a role in DNA damage signaling. Defects in MMR are associated with genome-wide instability, predisposition to certain types of cancer including HNPCC, resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, and abnormalities in meiosis and sterility in mammalian systems. The Escherichia coli MMR pathway has been extensively studied and is well characterized. In E. coli, the mismatch-activated MutS-MutL-ATP complex licenses MutH to incise the nearest unmethylated GATC sequence. UvrD and an exonuclease generate a gap. This gap is filled by pol III and DNA ligase. The GATC sites are then methylated by Dam. Several human MMR proteins have been identified based on their homology to E. coli MMR proteins. These include human homologs of MutS and MutL. Although E. coli MutS and MutL proteins are homodimers, human MutS and MutL homologs are heterodimers. The role of hemim",
  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. During an inflammation or immune reaction, specialized leukocytes (eosinophilic granulocytes) adhere to and pass through the endothelium of the blood vessels and the underlying matrix. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2. Adhesion (After activation of leukocyte integrins, firm contacts are established between them and endothelium molecules of the Ig superfamily - LFA-1, Mac-1, VLA-4 etc.); 3. Flattening of the cells and diapedesis (Adhering leukocytes crawl to an intercellular junction of the endothelium and then transmigrate to or even through the intercellular matrix. This is mediated by a homophilic interactions of PECAM and CD31.",
  "The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Normally, ligand-dependent signaling by Hedgehog (Hh) homologs proceeds through binding to the Patched receptor. This binding relieves the Patched-mediated inhibition of signaling through the Smoothened (SMOH) gene product. This signaling ultimately results in the dissociation of the Gli1 transcription factor from an inhibitory complex in the cytoplasm, its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, and activation of target gene expression. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (> 50%) in sporadic BCC.",
  "Migration of cells is involved in essential functions such as development, invasiveness of cancer cells, leukocyte movement toward chemotactic signals, and fibroblast response to injury. Cells can migrate in a specific direction in response to extracellular signals through pathways that trigger changes in the cytoskeleton, particularly actin filaments, increasing lamellipodia and filopodia formation and decreasing focal adhesions. Factors like PDGF activate PI3 kinase and multiple pathways downstream to stimulate cell migration. One pathway regulating migration through the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase does not require PI3-kinase activity. In this pathway, p85 of PI3-kinase activates cdc42, which activates N-Wasp (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) to regulate ARP-2 / 3. ARP-2 / 3 is a complex of proteins localized at the leading edge of moving cells that nucleates the formation of new actin fibers and interacts with Wasp to stimulate migration. The cdc42 pathway also regulates p21-activate kinase 1 (PAK1). Another pathway by which PI3 kinase regulates migration is through the small GTPase Rac. PAK1 is a downstream target of Rac as well as",
  "Telomeres, which define the ends of chromosomes, consist of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences loosely conserved in eukaryotes. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex (we only show a few of the components in this illustration) which in vitro recognizes a single-stranded G-rich telomere primer and adds multiple telomeric repeats to its 3-prime end by using an RNA template. Telomerase may also have a role in de novo formation of telomeres. Telomerase has been identified in many cultured cell lines and actively dividing cell types. The active reverse transcriptase component has been identified in teh TERT protein. The presence of this factor determines the availability of the telomerase function. The TERT protein has a high turnover rate and its expression is regulated by factors that promote growth (c-MYC, v-k-ras, Bcl-2 and E6) and inhibiting factors (RB and p53) that promote cell death or that block cell division. It appears that the regulation of active telomerase has many levels and can be inhibited by TEP1 not releasing TERT or by TRF1 which binds the end repeats and prevents access to the chromosome ends.

  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin proteins form pores in the membranes of the attacked cell, allowing the entry of Granzyme A and Granzyme B. Granzyme B induces caspase activation and cleavage of factors like ICAD, releasing DFF40 to fragment DNA, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Granzyme A is also an abundant granzyme released by cytotoxic T cells and is important in cytotoxic T cell induced apoptosis, activating caspase independent pathways. Once in a cell, Granzyme A activates DNA nicking by the recently identified DNAse NM23-H1, a tumor suppressor gene product whose expression is reduced in transformed, metastatic cells. The previous identification of NM23-H1 as a tumor suppressor indicates that its DNAse activity plays an important role in immune surveillance to prevent cancer through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of NM23-H1 occurs indirectly, through the cleavage of proteins that inhibit NM23-H1 in the SET complex, which includes SET, Ape1, pp32 and",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in early defenses against both allogeneic (nonself) cells and autologous cells undergoing various forms of stress, such as infection with viruses, bacteria, or parasites or malignant transformation. Although NK cells do not express classical antigen receptors of the immunoglobulin gene family, such as the antibodies produced by B cells or the T cell receptor expressed by T cells, they are equipped with various receptors whose engagement allows them to discriminate between target and nontarget cells. Activating receptors bind ligands on the target cell surface and trigger NK cell activation and target cell lysis. However Inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I molecules (HLA) and inhibit killing by NK cells by overruling the actions of the activating receptors. This inhibitory signal is lost when the target cells do not express MHC class I and perhaps also in cells infected with virus, which might inhibit MHC class I exprssion or alter its conformation. The mechanism of NK cell killing is the same as that used by the cytotoxic T cells generated in an adaptive immune response; cytotoxic granules are released onto the surface of the bound",
  "Regulation of T cell activation is a crucial component of balanced functioning of the immune system. If the T cell response is too great and activation of self-responsive cells or unstimulated cells is not suppressed, then autoimmune disorders or tissue injury can result. Unstimulated T cells are maintained in a quiescent state and the activity of self-reactive T cells is maintained in an anergic state in which IL-2 expression is repressed. IL-2 is a cytokine with a key role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The maintenance of T cells in the anergic or unstimulated state may not involve just an absence of activation, but an active repression of IL-2 expression, T cell proliferation and activation. TGF beta may play a role in suppressing T cell activation. Tob is a factor identified recently that represses T cell activation that is a member of a family of genes with anti-proliferative properties. Tob expression is highest in unstimulated and anergic T cells, and is reduced in activated T cells. Tob interacts with the TGF activated transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD4, increasing their binding to the IL-2 promoter",
  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",
  "Clot formation and fibrinolysis is a balance of plasmin activation / inhibition and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity that regulates fibrin polymer formation and degradation. Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by",
  "p27 / Kip1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase cdk2 / cyclin E and blocking cell cycle progression through the G1-S transition. Cancer cells in some cases have reduced levels of p27, supporting the importance of p27 in cell cycle regulation. The activity of p27 is regulated by phosphorylation, synthesis and degradation. Phosphorylation of p27 at threonine-187 by cdk2 causes p27 to associate with an SCF complex that targets p27 for proteolytic degradation. The F box protein Skp2 binds specifically to threonine-187 phosphorylated p27, recruiting it to the SCF complex for degradation. Other components of the p27 ubiquitin ligase complex include Skp1, Cul1, and Roc1 / Rbx-1. Cks-1 has also been identified in a reconstituted system as an essential component for recruitment of p27 for degradation by the SCF complex. Signaling by cytokines may modulate cell survival, proliferation, or apoptosis through modulation of p27 expression. Cytokine and AKT signaling pathways activate forkhead transcription factors that induce p27 expression at the transcriptional",
  "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has affected thousands of individuals, causing fever, and pneumonia with a mortality rate estimated at 10-18%. A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause agent and its genome has been sequenced. Human coronaviruses cause mild respiratory illness and accounts for about a third of all cases of the common cold. The enveloped SARS virus contains a large + strand RNA genome, approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Examination of the SARS coronavirus sequences reveals that rep gene covers over 20,000 nucleotides and encodes two overlapping polyproteins cleaved by viral proteases into smaller protein products. Translation of the longer polyprotein encoded by the rep gene requires a ribosomal frameshift. Other viral genes are predicted to encode the transmembrane spike protein S involved in viral fusion with host cells, the envelope protein E, the membrane protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N that binds to the RNA genome as well as several additional open reading frames with unknown functions. Viral entry into the cell is followed by translation of the viral rep gene, which codes for a viral protease within the polyprotein, Mpro or 3CL",
  "Reliable neurotransmitter release requires the presence of sufficent numbers of synaptic vesicles. The process of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) is coordinated by a group of proteins called dephosphins. The current set of seven known dephosphins are nerve treminal proteins with little or no structural hoimology but satisfy two essential criteria: they are essential for SVE and they are rapidly and coordinately dephosphorlyated in response to a calcium influx through voltage-dependent calicium channels. The calicium signal is mediated by calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin. Each dephosphin plays an essential role in overlapping phases or segments of the cycle. The four phases of SVE are nucleation, invagination, fission and uncoating. In this diagram the internalization of the vesicle is the uncoating step. In order to illustrate the complexity of this process the initial display of the protein is labelled with a name and a number. This number is then used at the decloaking or uncoating step to show the release and seperation of the various factors. Each step in the process has a different set of complex components. The",
  "E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2 / cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2 / cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2 / cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S / G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical,",
  "Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps known as G1 and G2 phases. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage, the checkpoint kinase ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. p5",
  "Pathogenic Salmonella enter cells such as those of the intestinal epithelium by altering cellular cytoskeletal structure and inducing membrane ruffling of the infected cell. Salmonella is able to alter the cytoskeleton and membrane through the action of secreted bacterial Sip proteins, SopE, SopB, and SptP that are inserted into the cytosol of the infected cell. Sip proteins encoded by Salmonella are required for the action of SopE and for the invasion of epithelial cells. SipA stabilizes actin filaments, inducing membrane ruffling and perhaps focusing membrane changes where bacteria are localized to allow their entry. SipC produces a similar effect on actin filaments and cytoskeletal structure. SopE acts as an exchange factor on Rac1 and Cdc42, two GTPases in the Rho family that regulate actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 by Salmonella SopE induces changes in cytoskeleton structure that allow bacterial entry into the cell. SopB is another salmonella protein that acts as an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and also stimulates Cdc42 and Rac1. One of the cellular targets of both Cdc42 and Rac1 that affects actin structure is the Arp2 / 3 complex. Cdc",

The neurotrophin family consists of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4). Neurotrophins exert their functions through engagement of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors or p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Neurotrophin / Trk signaling is regulated by connecting a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, which include MAPK pathway, PI-3 kinase pathway, and PLC pathway, transmitting positive signals like enhanced survival and growth. On the other hand, p75NTR transmits both positive and nagative signals. These signals play an important role for neural development and additional higher-order activities such as learning and memory.",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The intrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to the blood or exposure of blood to collagen in a traumatized vessel wall. This usually also results in damage to fragile platelets. The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes 1 to 6 minutes. This cascade begins with the activation of factor XII and the release of platelet factor 3 (PF3) from damaged platelets. Activated factor XII cleaves and actives factor XI and prekallikrein (PK). Factor XII is also activated by activated prekallikrein (aPK) in an internal amplification loop. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for the initial three steps. The prothrombin activator in the intrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the extrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also",
  "The G2 / M DNA damage checkpoint prevents the cell from entering mitosis (M phase) if the genome is damaged. The Cdc2-cyclin B kinase is pivotal in regulating this transition. During G2 phase, Cdc2 is maintained in an inactive state by the kinases Wee1 and Mt1. As cells approach M phase, the phosphatase Cdc25 is activated, perhaps by the polo-kinase Pik1. Cdc25 then activates Cdc2, establishing a feedback amplification loop that efficiently drives the cell into mitosis. DNA damage activates the DNA-PK / ATM / ATR kinases, initiating two parallel cascades that inactivate Cdc2-cyclin B. The first cascade rapidly inhibits progression into mitosis: the CHK kinases phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc25, which can no longer activate Cdc2. The second cascade is slower. Phosphorylation of p53 dissociates it from MDM2, activating its DNA binding activity. Acetylation by p300 / PCAF further activates its transcriptional activity. The genes that are turned on by p53 constitute effectors of this second cascade. They include 14-3-3s, which binds to the phosphorylated Cdc2-cyclin B kinase",
  "Hypoxic stress, like DNA damage, induces p53 protein accumulation and p53-dependent apoptosis in oncogenically transformed cells. Unlike DNA damage, hypoxia does not induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, suggesting that p53 activity is differentially regulated by these two stresses. Hypoxia induces p53 protein accumulation, but in contrast to DNA damage, hypoxia fails to induce endogenous downstream p53 effector mRNAs and proteins, such as p21, Bax, CIP1, WAF1 etc. Hypoxia does not inhibit the induction of p53 target genes by ionizing radiation, indicating that p53-dependent transactivation requires a DNA damage-inducible signal that is lacking under hypoxic treatment alone. The phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. Mdm-2 targets the p53 tumor suppressor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome, but, in addition, the p53 transcription",
  "Progesterone (Pg) binds to both intracellular iPR and plasma membrane- bound mPR. (Right Top) After binding to Pg, iPR is recruited to the membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase p60c- src, which induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in activation of p90Rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Myt1, which favors formation of the activated cell cycle complex cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 causes breakdown of the germinal vesicle and the initiation of oocyte maturation. (Left). In contrast, binding of Pg to mPR leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through activation of Gi or inhibition of Gs. This leads to a decrease in the cAMPdependent kinase PKA, which relieves inhibition of Cdc25C (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cyclin B-Cdc2) and also indirectly promotes the activation of MAPK signaling. PKA also regulates the initiation of oocyte maturation through other effects that are independent of PKA activity.",
  "G-aS-coupled receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC), which synthesizes cAMP from ATP. In contrast Gai-coupled receptors inhibit AC and so reduce cAMP formation. The bg subunits from Gai and other G proteins are able to activate the MAP kinase pathways and PLCb. GPCRs coupled to the Gaq family of G proteins stimulate PLCb, which cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce IP3, which mobilizes intracellular calcium, and DAG, which activates PKC. Second messenger pathways then activate a range of effector systems to change cell behaviour; in many cases this includes the regulation of gene transcription. Dotted line shows a more indirect pathway.",
  "B cells must communicate with their environment to participate in the immune system as the source of antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates activation of B cells and T cells through dephosphorylation of signaling factors. CD32 is",
  "The appropriate signaling through the insulin pathway is critical for the regulation of glucose levels and the avoidance of diabetes. Insulin forms a complex with the Insulin Receptor (IR) and b chains to form the active signaling complex. Through recruitment of adaptor molecules and the activation of RAS, the activated IR can cause transcriptional activation.",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates",
  "Significant progress has been made towards delineation of the intrinsic molecular processes that regulate B lymphocyte immune function. Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of",
  "To replicate in the host cell, viruses commandeer cellular signaling pathways. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus with that is widespread in the population but usually causes disease only in immunocompromised individuals and is also a viral cause of birth defects. One of the actions of CMV in the host cell is to stimulate MAP kinase pathways. Both p38 and ERK kinases are activated by CMV infection through activation map kinase kinases and inhibition of phosphatases. One result of Map kinase activation by CMV is activation of transcription of viral genes, increasing the production of viral gene products. Both p38 and ERK kinases contribute to the activation of viral genes by cellular transcription factors acting through the viral UL4 promoter at upstream and basal transcription elements. Another target of prolonged p38 activation during infection is Rb, contributing to viral replication. Activation of MKK1 and MKK2 leads to Erk1 and Erk2 activation, and phosphorylation of downstream targets. The MEKK1 kinase regulates the immediate early promoter indirectly through downstream kinase signaling and perhaps more directly through activation of NF-kB. Map kinase pathways activated by CMV converge on increased transcription of viral genes and increased replication of",
  "Map kinases transduce responses to extracellular signals by a variety of routes, and communicate with other pathways through extensive crosstalk networks. A closely studied Map kinase cascade originates with tyrosine kinase activation, and activation of Ras. Ras activates Raf, Raf activates the Map kinase kinases Mek1 and Mek2 and these kinases activate downstream Map kinases like Erk1 and Erk2. Erk1 and Erk2 in turn activate transgenes like p35 through the Map kinase activated transcription factor EGR-1. Mek1 plays a central role in many different Map kinase pathways. Factors that activate Mek1 include growth factors like NGF, cytokines, chemokines, and phorbol ester, resulting in cellular proliferation and survival. Mek1 activation may also play a role in differentiation in neuronal tissues. In cultured neuronal PC-12 cells, NGF induces neurite outgrowth via Mek1 and the map kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of Mek1 can transform cells and may play a role in cancer. The crucial role of Mek1 in a variety of pathways including cellular transformation suggests that the cell must tightly regulate its activity. Cdk5 is a kinase that regulates the activity of Mek1. Although Cdk5",
  "Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite of macrophages that causes visceral, mucosal, and cutaneous diseases. The parasite is transmitted to humans by sandflies, where they survive and proliferate intracellularly by deactivating the macrophage. Successful infection of Leishmania is achieved by alteration of signaling events in the host cell, leading to enhanced production of the autoinhibitory molecules like TGF-beta and decreased induction of cytokines such as IL12 for protective immunity. Nitric oxide production is also inhibited. In addition, defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes silences subsequent T cell activation mediated by macrophages, resulting in abnormal immune responses.",
  "Heart formation is cued by a combination of positive and negative signals from surrounding tissues. Inhibitory signals that block heart formation in anterior paraxial mesoderm include Wnt family members expressed in dorsal neural tube and anti-BMPs expressed in the axial tissues (i.e., noggin in the notochord). Wnt signalling pathway, which is essential for setting up the entire body pattern during embryonic development involves glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK3 is active and phosphorylates b-catenin resulting in its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits GSK3, thereby preventing phosphorylation of b-catenin, which is then able to move to the nucleus. There it associates with members of the LEF-1 / TCF family of transcription factors, which activate the transcription of genes like cyclin-D1, myc, and MMPs. The Wnt signaling pathway is blocked by a family of secreted proteins such as crescent and Dkk-1 sufficient for induction of heart formation in posterior mesoderm. BMP signaling can also be blocked by the BMP antagonists noggin and chordin, which are secreted from the notochord and cooperate",
  "Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. This classification has also been justified at the molecular level with Type 1 tumours being more commonly associated with abnormalities of DNA-mismatch repair genes, K-ras, PTEN and beta-catenin, and Type 2 tumours with abnormalities of p53 and HER2 / neu.",
  "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are essential for neuromuscular signaling and are also expressed in non-neuronal tissues, where their function is less clear. Although nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are primarily known for their action as ligand-gated ion channels transducing action potentials across synapses, they may have other actions. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in neurons alter apoptotic signaling, protecting against cell death in some settings, and this action may in some cases be directed through alternative signaling pathways. In neurons the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor activates PI3 kinase through a src-family kinase, activating the anti-apoptotic kinase AKT. One pathway involved in AKT signaling involves phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, causing its retention in the cytoplasm associated with 14-3-3, and blocking expression of the apoptotic fas protein. The PI3 kinase / AKT pathway protects a broad range of neurons against apoptotic cell death and may block apoptosis triggered by beta-amyloid fragments that contributes to the progression of Alzheimers disease. If so, nicotinic agents may prove useful in the treatment of this and other neurodegenerative conditions. There are several proteins that modulate the response of nicotinic acetylcholine",

  "Myocardial infarction damages heart tissue both during the initial ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion of tissues with oxygen. Corticosteroids can protect cardiac tissue from damage following a heart attack, but the mechanisms by which corticosteroids are cardioprotective have not been clear and negative side effects such as reduced wound healing may result from their use. Corticosteroids exert a variety of actions through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. GR acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, but some of the cardioprotective effects mediated by GR-bound corticosteroids are non-transcriptional in nature. Glucocorticoids are commonly used as anti-inflammatory drugs in a variety of conditions, and some of their effects in the heart result from inhibition of the inflammatory response of heart tissue to ischemia and reperfusion. NF-kB is a transcription factor involved in signaling by inflammatory factors such as TNF, and is repressed by glucocorticoids. Annexin-1 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein whose expression is induced by corticosteroids and inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into tissue, blocking reperfusion-induced inflammatory heart damage. A non-transcriptional cardioprotective effect of glucocorticoids is activation of",

  "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage biological macromolecules and are detrimental to cellular health. Electrophilic compounds, xenobiotics and antioxidants are sources of reactive oxygen species, creating oxidative stress that can harm cells. Enzymes are involved in the Phase II detoxification of xenobiotics to reduce cellular stress include glutathione transferases, quinone reductase, epoxide hydrolase, heme oxygenase, UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Expression of these genes protects cells from oxidative damage and can prevent mutagenesis and cancer. Transcription of these enzymes is coordinately regulated through antioxidant response elements (AREs). Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) and Nrf1 are transcription factors that bind to AREs and activate these genes. Inactive Nrf2 is retained in the cytosol by association a complex with the cytoskeletal protein Keap1. Cytosolic Nrf2 is phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to protein kinase C activation and Map kinase pathways. In the nucleus, Nrf2 activate genes through AREs by interacting with transcription factors in the bZIP family, including CREB, ATF4 and fos or jun. Nrf2 activation of genes is opposed by small maf proteins, including MafG and MafK,",
  "Migration of cells is involved in essential functions such as development, invasiveness of cancer cells, leukocyte movement toward chemotactic signals, and fibroblast response to injury. Cells can migrate in a specific direction in response to extracellular signals through pathways that trigger changes in the cytoskeleton, particularly actin filaments, increasing lamellipodia and filopodia formation and decreasing focal adhesions. Factors like PDGF activate PI3 kinase and multiple pathways downstream to stimulate cell migration. One pathway regulating migration through the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase does not require PI3-kinase activity. In this pathway, p85 of PI3-kinase activates cdc42, which activates N-Wasp (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) to regulate ARP-2 / 3. ARP-2 / 3 is a complex of proteins localized at the leading edge of moving cells that nucleates the formation of new actin fibers and interacts with Wasp to stimulate migration. The cdc42 pathway also regulates p21-activate kinase 1 (PAK1). Another pathway by which PI3 kinase regulates migration is through the small GTPase Rac. PAK1 is a downstream target of Rac as well as",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, which include TGF-betas, activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are structurally related secreted cytokines found in species ranging from worms and insects to mammals. A wide spectrum of cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration are regulated by TGF-beta family members. TGF-beta family member binds to the Type II receptor and recruits Type I, whereby Type II receptor phosphorylates and activates Type I. The Type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads: Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8). Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and the heteromeric complex then translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Smad complexes activate specific genes through cooperative interactions with other DNA-binding and coactivator (or co-repressor) proteins.",
  "The complement cascade of proteolytic factors involved in cellular lysis can be initiated by several different factors, including antibody-dependent and antibody-independent recognition of infectious organisms. In the lectin-induced complement cascade, carbohydrates on the surface of microbial cells activate the complement cascade by binding to mannan-binding lectin (also called the mannan-binding protein, Mbl / Mbp). Mbp is an acute phase serum protein whose expression is induced by microbial infection. The binding of Mbl to microbial ligands activates the Mbl associated serine proteases Masp1 and Masp2, triggering the cleavage of C2 and C4 to create C4bC2a, a C3 convertase that cleaves large numbers of C3. Masp1 and Masp2 are similar to the C1 protease in the classical complement pathway. Once formed the C3 convertase cleaves and activates the remaining complement factors leading ultimately to formation of a pore in the bacterial membrane by the membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses the bacterial cell. The lectin-induced pathway also appears to play an important role of the activation of phagocytotic cells by infection. Although the initiating event activating the",
  "The Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway involving eight enzymes essential for energy production through aerobic respiration, and, like glycolysis, arose early in evolution. This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl",
  "Contraction of the heart is a complex process initiated by the electrical excitation of cardiac myocytes (excitation-contraction coupling, ECC). In cardiac myocytes, Ca2 + influx induced by activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (DHP receptors) upon membrane depolarization triggers the release of Ca2 + via Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through a Ca2 + -induced Ca release (CICR) mechanism. Ca2 + ions released via the CICR mechanism diffuse through the cytosolic space to contractile proteins to bind to troponinC resulting in the release of inhibition induced by troponinI. The Ca2 + binding to troponinC thereby triggers the sliding of thin and thick filaments, that is, the activation of a crossbridge and subsequent cardiac force development and / or cell shortening. Recovery occurs as Ca2 + is pumped out of the cell by the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) or is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by sarco (endo) plasmic Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) pumps on the non-junctional region of the SR.",
  "Insulin resistance is strongly associated with type II diabetes. Diabetogenic factors including FFA, TNFalpha and cellular stress induce insulin resistance through inhibition of IRS1 functions. Serine / threonine phosphorylation, interaction with SOCS, regulation of the expression, modification of the cellular localization, and degradation represent the molecular mechanisms stimulated by them. Various kinases (ERK, JNK, IKKbeta, PKCzeta, PKCtheta and mTOR) are involved in this process. The development of type II diabetes requires impaired beta-cell function. Chronic hyperglycemia has been shown to induce multiple defects in beta-cells. Hyperglycemia has been proposed to lead to large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beta-cells, with subsequent damage to cellular components including PDX-1. Loss of PDX-1, a critical regulator of insulin promoter activity, has also been proposed as an important mechanism leading to beta-cell dysfunction. Although there is little doubt as to the importance of genetic factors in type II diabetes, genetic analysis is difficult due to complex interaction among multiple susceptibility genes and between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have therefore given very diverse results. Kir6.2",

  "Within the compact cilia of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) a cascade of enzymatic activity transduces the binding of an odorant molecule to a receptor into an electrical signal that can be transmitted to the brain. Odorant molecules bind to a receptor protein (R) coupled to an olfactory specific Gs-protein (G) and activate a type III adenylyl cyclase (AC), increasing intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP targets an olfactory-specific cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNG), allowing cations, particularly Na and Ca, to flow down their electrochemical gradients into the cell, depolarizing the ORN. Furthermore, the Ca entering the cell is able to activate a Ca-activated Cl channel, which would allow Cl to flow out of the cell, thus further increasing the depolarization. Elevated intracellular Ca causes adaptation by at least two different molecular steps: inhibition of the activity of adenylyl cyclase via CAMKII-dependent phosphorylation and down-regulation of the affinity of the CNG channel to cAMP.Longer exposure to odorants can stimulate particulate guanylyl cyclase in cilia to produce cGMP and activate PKG, leading to a further increase in",
  "Many transcription factors play essential roles in normal development by determining the proliferation and differentiation of cells. The coordinated transcriptional control of proliferation in specific developmental cell types is crucial in multiple developmental settings. One of a family of three bicoid-related transcription factors, Pitx2 acts downstream of the extracellular signaling protein Wnt to drive proliferation of cells with specific developmental fates, including cells in the pituitary, cardiac outflow region, and muscle. Wnt binds to Frizzled, a G-protein coupled receptor, activating homologs of the Drosophila Disheveled protein. Activation of Frizzled and Disheveled inhibits the kinase GSK-3 beta, part of a protein complex in the absence of Wnt signaling, causing beta-catenin protein to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Beta-catenin is known to alter the function of transcription factors like TCF / Lef. One result of Wnt signaling is activation of the transcription factor Lef by beta-catenin, inducing Pitx2 expression. Wnt activation also changes Pitx2 from a repressor to an activator by causing transcriptional corepressors like histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) bound to Pitx2 to be exchanged for coactivators. With coactivators bound",
  "Clot formation and fibrinolysis is a balance of plasmin activation / inhibition and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity that regulates fibrin polymer formation and degradation. Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by",
  "The amyloid -beta peptide (Ab), a proteolytic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the major componenet of senile plaques, the hallmark of alzhemiers disease. Platelets contain both APP and Ab and probably contribute greater than 90% of circulating APP. The soluble APP is the major inhibitor of coagulation factors IXa and XIa, and platelet aggregation. Agonists such as ADP, thrombin, epinephrine and collagen activate the release of APP and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (an important regulator of coagulation) from platelet storage granules. These important molecules released from platelets are key regulators of hemostasis, the physiologic arrest of hemorrhage at site of vascular leakage.",
  "Blood-cell development progresses from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), which can undergo either self-renewal or differentiation into a multilineage committed progenitor cell: a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) or a common myeloid progenitor (CMP). A CLP gives rise to the lymphoid lineage of white blood cells or leukocytes-the natural killer (NK) cells and the T and B lymphocytes. A CMP gives rise to the myeloid lineage, which comprises the rest of the leukocytes, the erythrocytes (red blood cells), and the megakaryocytes that produce platelets important in blood clotting. Cells undergoing these differentiation process express a stage- and lineage-specific set of surface markers. Therefore cellular stages are identified by the specific expression patterns of these genes.",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates",
  "CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor in the GPCR gene family, and is expressed by cells in the immune system and the central nervous system. In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role",
  "Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes.

  "The p44 / 42 MAP Kinase pathway consists of a protein kinase cascade linking growth and differentiation signals with transcription in the nucleus. Growth factor receptors and tyrosine kinases activate Ras which in turn activates c-Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. Activated p44 / 42 MAP Kinase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription by phosphorylation of kinases such as p90 RSK, MSK, and transcription factors such as ELK-1 and Stat3. The importance of this pathway in both growth control and development has been demonstrated via the transforming properties of various mutant forms of Ras, Raf, MEK and by their effects on development. Signal amplification and the potential for crosstalk appear to be important features of this regulatory network.",
  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVD / C. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt / beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger",
  "Eenteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are closely related pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. The hallmark of EPEC / EHEC infections is induction of attaching and effacing (A / E) lesions that damage intestinal epithelial cells. The capacity to form A / E lesions is encoded mainly by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Tir, Map, EspF, EspG are known LEE-encoded effector proteins secreted via the type III secretion system, which is also LEE-encoded, into the host cell. EPEC and EHEC Tir's link the extracellular bacterium to the cell cytoskeleton. Map and EspF are involved in mitochondrion membrane permeabilization. EspG interacts with tubulins and stimulates microtubule destabilization. LEE-encoded adhesin or intimin (Eae) is exported via the general secretory pathway to the periplasm, where it is inserted into the outer membrane. In addition to Tir, two potential host cell-carried intimin receptors, beta1 integrin (ITGB1) and nucleolin (NCL), have so far been identified. The",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK.",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",
  "Xenopus oocytes are naturally arrested at G2 of meiosis I. Exposure to either insulin / IGF-1 or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks this arrest and induces resumption of the two meiotic division cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg. This process is termed oocyte maturation. The transition is accompanied by an increase in maturation promoting factor (MPF or Cdc2 / cyclin B) which precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Most reports point towards the Mos-MEK1-ERK2 pathway and the polo-like kinase / CDC25 pathway as responsible for the activation of MPF in meiosis, most likely triggered by a decrease in cAMP.",
  "Thrombopoietin (TPO) binds to its receptor inducing aggregation and activation. TPO signals its growth regulating effects to the cell through several major pathways including MAPK (ERK and JNK), Protein Kinase C, and JAK / Stat.",
  "CD4 + helper T cells differentiate into distinct subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells. Th2 cells are involved in the response to extracellular helminthe parasites and allergic responses and secrete a distinct set of cytokines including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. The development and differentiation of T cells is influenced by many factors, including transcription factors such as GATA-3, a transcription factor associated with induction of Th2 cells. Factors that increase cAMP levels in Th2 cells activate p38 kinase, which phosphorylates and activates GATA-3 independently of PKA. Cells expressing GATA-3 develop the profile of Th2 cells, secreting IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. These cytokines are found in a gene cluster together and are regulated coordinately by GATA-3. Binding of GATA-3 in the regulatory regions of these genes alters chromatin structure, increasing accessibility to other transcription factors. Activation of the T cell receptor through interaction with antigen on antigen presenting cells activates NFAT and other transcription factors that cooperate with GATA-3 in inducing Th2 cell differentiation. Dominant negative GATA-3 can repress the secretion of these cytokines and block",
  "All taste pathways are proposed to converge on common elements that mediate a rise in intracellular Ca2 + followed by neurotransmitter release. Na + salt depolarizes taste cells by passive influx of Na + through the amiloride-sensitive Na + channel (ENaC). Acids depolarize taste cells by a variety of mechanisms, including influx of protons (H +) through ENaC and a proton-gated cation channel (MDEG). Two putative umami receptors have been identified: a truncated variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 and the heterodimer, T1R1 + T1R3. Umami receptors are coupled to a signaling pathway involving activation of PLCbeta2, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activation of a transient receptor potential channel, TRPM5. Bitter compounds, such as denatonium and PROP, activate particular T2R / TRB isoforms, which activate gustducin heterotrimers. Activated alpha-gustducin stimulates PDE to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas betagamma subunits activate PLCbeta2 to generate IP3, which leads to release of Ca2 + from internal stores. Artificial sweeteners activate GPCRs (",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) -1 / 2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1 / 2 / 3), p38 proteins (p38alpha / beta / gamma / delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1 / 2 for ERK1 / 2, MKK3 / 6 for the p38, MKK4 / 7 (JNKK1 / 2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1 / 2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1 / 2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.",
  "p53 is a transcription factor who's activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The function is p53 is to keep the cell from progressing through the cell cycle if there is damage to DNA present. It may do this in multiple ways from holding the cell at a checkpoint until repairs can be made to causing the cell to enter apoptosis if the damage cannot be repaired. The critical role of p53 is evidenced by the fact that it is mutated in a very large fraction of tumors from nearly all sources.",
  "Four different members of the Sprouty protein family block the cellular proliferation and differentiation induced by several different growth factors, including EGF and FGF. One mechanism by which Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling is through binding to Grb-2, a signaling intermediary between the tyrosine kinase growth factors and the Ras / map kinase pathway. Binding of Sprouty to Grb-2 prevents Grb-2 and Sos-1 from interacting with downstream signaling factors that activate Ras and map kinases, including Ras, Raf-1, Mek1, Erk1 / 2 and downstream transcription factors. The action of Sprouty as an inhibitor of this pathway requires Sprouty phosphorylation and membrane localization, at the site of the factors it interacts with. The inhibition of growth factor signaling by Sprouty is specific to the Ras pathway since the PI3 Kinase pathway responsible for cell survival signals from growth factor receptors is not inhibited by Sprouty. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is also not affected. The mechanism by which Sprouty inhibits Ras activation may be by blocking the nucleotide exchange activity of Sos. Sprouty",
  "TNFR2 is the receptor for the 171 amino acid 19 kD TNF (beta) (a.k.a. lymphotoxin). TNF (beta) is produced by activated lymphocytes and can be cytotoxic to many tumor and other cells. In neutrophils, endothelial cells and osteoclasts TNF (beta) can lead to activation while in many other cell types it can lead to increased expression of MHC and adhesion molecules.",
  "Attachment of the ubiquitin peptide to proteins targets them for proteolytic degradation by a complex cellular structure, the proteasome. The regulated proteolysis of proteins by proteasomes removes denatured, damaged or improperly translated proteins from cells and regulates the level of proteins like cyclins or some transcription factors. E1 and E2 enzymes prepare ubiquitin chains that are then attached to proteins by the E3 enzyme. The sequence of ubiquitin and the basic structure and function of the proteasome are highly conserved. The core proteasome in man (20S proteasome) consists of four rings each with 14 subunits stacked on top of each other that are responsible for the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. The PA700 regulatory complex is stacked on the ends of the cylindrical core to form a 26S proteasome. Proteins that are tagged with ubiquitin are recognized and bound by the regulatory subunits, then unfolded in an ATP-dependent manner, and inserted into the core particle, where proteases degrade the protein, releasing small peptides and releasing the ubiquitin intact. The PA28 regulatory complex is alternative regulatory complex that appears to play a role in antigen processing for presentation of peptides to immune cells in the",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "Cysteine and methionine are sulfur-containing amino acids. Cysteine is synthesized from serine through different pathways in different organism groups. In bacteria and plants, cysteine is converted from serine (via acetylserine) by transfer of hydrogen sulfide. In animals, methionine-derived homocysteine is used as sulfur source and its condensation product with serine (cystathionine) is converted to cysteine. Cysteine is metabolized to pyruvate in multiple routes. Methionine is an essential amino acid, which animals cannot synthesize. In bacteria and plants, methionine is synthesized from aspartate. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), synthesized from methionine and ATP, is a methyl group donor in many important transfer reactions including DNA methylation for regulation of gene expression. SAM may also be used to regenerate methionine in the methionine salvage pathway.",
  "After transcription, eukaryotic mRNA precursors contain protein-coding exons and noncoding introns. In the following splicing, introns are excised and exons are joined by a macromolecular complex, the spliceosome. The standard spliceosome is made up of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, and several spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs). Spliceosomes are not a simple stable complex, but a dynamic family of particles that assemble on the mRNA precursor and help fold it into a conformation that allows transesterification to proceed. Various spliceosome forms (e.g. A-, B- and C-complexes) have been identified.",
  "Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would",

  "Signaling by interferon-gamma stimulates anti-viral responses and tumor suppression through the heterodimeric interferon-gamma receptor. Signaling is initiated by binding of interferon-gamma to its receptor, activating the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate STAT transcription factors that activate interferon responsive genes. Molecular chaperones that modulate or alter protein folding interact with different components of the interferon signaling pathway. One chaperone that modulates interferon signaling is hTid-1, a member of the DnaJ family of chaperones and a cochaperone for the heat shock protein Hsp70, another molecular chaperone. hTid-1 was found in a two-hybrid screen to bind to JAK2 and also to interact with the interferon-gamma receptor. In addition, hTid-1 and JAK2 also interact with Hsp70. Overexpression of hTid-1 represses transcriptional activation by interferon-gamma and Hsp70 dissociates from these proteins when interferon is added to cells, suggesting that Hsp70 holds Jak2 in an inactive conformation prior to ligand activation, and is released in the presence of agonist to allow the activation of Jak-2 and downstream pathway",
  "Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "HIV infection leads to drastic declines in CD4 T helper cells, in part through apoptosis of uninfected cells. Apoptosis of uninfected cells may be induced through the expression of Fas ligand on the surface of HIV-infected cells, stimulating the Fas-dependent apoptotic pathway in cells that come in contact with infected cells. The NEF protein expressed by HIV may play induce the expression of Fas-ligand by infected cells. If this is the case, then a question that arises is how infected cells themselves escape Fas-mediated apoptosis. The NEF protein appears to play a role in this process as well. NEF interacts with the ASK1 kinase (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase) involved in apoptotic signaling by TNF and Fas-ligand. Interaction of NEF with ASK1 prevents phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases and JNK kinases involved in apoptotic signaling.",
  "Hypertrophy associated with both hypertension and obstruction to ventricular outflow leads to pathologic cardiac growth and it is associated with increase morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic ventricular disease takes a growing toll on the health of nations. As other cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infraction are in decline as causes of mortality, the heart failure problem becomes increasingly urgent. Congenital heart defects occur in 1% of live births and fetal heart malformations are implicated in many pregnancies that end in still-birth or spontaneous abortion. The current paradigm suggests that the heart adapts to excess of hemodynamic loading by compensatory hypertrophy, which under condition of persistent stress, over time evolves into dysfunction and myocardial failure. There is considerable evidence that direct effects of increased mechanical stress are sensed within the ventricular wall and that signals critical for the generation of growth responses. Despite compelling statistics we still do not understand biochemically why heart defects are so prevalent. A single transcriptional regulator initially associated with the activation of the T-cells",
  "The appropriate signaling through the insulin pathway is critical for the regulation of glucose levels and the avoidance of diabetes. Insulin forms a complex with the Insulin Receptor (IR) and b chains to form the active signaling complex.

  "Inflammation has several distinct components, including the localized response at the site of tissue injury or infection. Tissue injury stimulates the release of inflammatory signaling molecules such as bradykinin. Bacterial infection stimulates an immune response in several ways. Bacteria that are phagocytosed can activate macrophages, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. Bacteria can also activate the complement cascade through either the antibody-mediated pathway (classical pathway) or the alternative complement pathway. In extravascular tissues, cells that respond to infection or injury include macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages and other immune cells secrete chemokines that recruit leukocytes from the circulation to the site of inflammation. Mast cells release histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes that act as chemokines, increase vascular permeability, and act on the vascular endothelium to increase tissue recruitment of leukocytes. Chemokines can recruit leukocytes or lymphocytes out of the blood stream into tissues and make blood vessels more permeable. Leukocytes are activated by inflammatory signals to express adhesion molecules that cause them to interact with the vascular endothelium, penetrate the endothelial wall and migrate into the extracellular space of tissues. The combined response of immune",

  "Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes.

  "Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD), thought to be a molecular and cellular basis for cerebellar learning, is a process involving a decrease in the synaptic strength between parallel fiber (PF) and Purkinje cells (PCs) induced by the conjunctive activation of PFs and climbing fiber (CF). Multiple signal transduction pathways have been shown to be involved in this process. Activation of PFs terminating on spines in dendritic branchlets leads to glutamate release and activation of both AMPA and mGluRs. Activation of CFs, which make multiple synaptic contacts on proximal dendrites, also via AMPA receptors, opens voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and causes a generalized influx of calcium. These cellular signals, generated from two different synaptic origins, trigger a cascade of events culminating in a phosphorylation-dependent, long-term reduction in AMPA receptor sensitivity at the PF-PC synapse. This may take place either through receptor internalization and / or through receptor desensitization.",
  "TNFR1 (a.k.a. p55, CD120a) is the receptor for TNF (alpha) and also will bind TNF (beta). Upon binding TNF (alpha) a TNFR1 + cell is triggered to undergo apoptosis.

  "The PML nuclear bodies are ring-shaped nuclear substructures associated with the regulation of transcription, transformation, cell growth, and apoptosis and are characterized by the presence of the protein PML. The activities of PML as a tumor suppressor and apoptosis inducing factor are exerted through the numerous proteins it interacts with in the PML-nuclear bodies including the tumor suppressor p53. DNA damage induced activation of p53-dependent apoptosis requires PML. PML acts as a coactivator for p53 and increases acetylation of p53 by the transcriptional coactivator CBP. This acetylation of p53 is reversed by the deacetylase SirT1, the human homolog of the yeast gene Sir2, and this deacetylation opposes the transcriptional activation of p53. The tumor suppressor Rb also interacts with the PML nuclear body, increasing transcriptional repression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, suggesting that PML may affect cellular transformation through more than one mechanism. PML interacts directly with Ubc9, which modifies PML through the attachment of the ubiquitin-like peptide Sumo-1. Sumo-1 modification of PML is not necessary for the nuclear bodies to form, but may",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc-gamma-R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.",
  "Mitochondria participate in apoptotic signaling pathways through the release of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase pathway. Smac / DIABLO is released from mitochondria and inhibits IAP proteins that normally interact with caspase-9 to inhibit apoptosis. Apoptosis regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins occurs as family members form complexes that enter the mitochondrial membrane, regulating the release of cytochrome c and other proteins. TNF family receptor that cause apoptosis directly activate the caspase cascade, but can also activate Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, which activates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Bax, another Bcl-2 family member, is activated by this pathway to localize to the mitochondrial membrane and increase its permeability, releasing cytochre c and other mitochondrial proteins. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent pore formation, blocking apoptosis. AIF (Apoptosis inducing factor) is another mitochondrial factor that is released into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis. AIF-induced",
  "During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation, called meiosis I and meiosis II. At meiosis I, homologous chromosomes recombine and then segregate to opposite poles, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In vertebrates, immature oocytes are arrested at the PI (prophase of meiosis I). The resumption of meiosis is stimulated by progesterone, which carries the oocyte through two consecutive M-phases (MI and MII) to a second arrest at MII. The key activity driving meiotic progression is the MPF (maturation-promoting factor), a heterodimer of CDC2 (cell division cycle 2 kinase) and cyclin B. In PI-arrested oocytes, MPF is initially inactive and is activated by the dual-specificity CDC25C phosphatase as the result of new synthesis of Mos induced by progesterone. MPF activation mediates the transition from the PI arrest to MI. The subsequent decrease in MPF levels, required to exit from MI into interkinesis, is induced by a negative feedback loop, where CDC2 brings about the activation of the APC (anaphase-promoting complex), which mediates",
  "The epidermis, which provides a protective barrier that undergoes a constant renewal, is a multi-layered tissue with the proliferating cells located in the basal layer. As cells leave the basal layer the underog significant differentiation, biochemical and morphological remodeling. The final differentiation results in the formation of corneocytes. In vitro keratinocytes mimic this process. Several genes mark keratinocyte specific differentiation. Among the most frequently tracked markers are Transglutaminase, Cystatin and Involucrin. The keratinocyte differentiation studies have identified and provided significant detail regarding the involvement of three of the 4 major MAP kinase pathways from several diverse stimuli such as EGF, FAS, TNF and Calicium influx. The p38 cascade is represented twice since both p38alpha (p38) and p38delta (MAPK13) are involved. The keratinocyte differentiation cascased also provide for detailed study of the functions of individual PKC isoforms. It is interesting to note the contrasting functions of the PKC isoforms in this process. In recent studies it has been determined that the cPKC (conventional / classical Protein Kinase C) isoforms, which are calcium-",
  "The complement system is part of the defense against invading cells and is composed of about twenty different proteins found in the plasma. When activated, complement proteins form a pathway of proteolytic reactions that culminates in the lysis of foreign cells. The complement system also stimulates phagocytosis of foreign cells and an inflammatory response. There are two different complement systems, the classical complement pathway initiated by antibody complexes on the cell surface, and an alternative complement pathway that is initiated without antibodies. The complement system proteins are named with a capital C followed by a number. A small letter after the number indicates that the protein is a smaller protein resulting from the cleavage of a larger precursor by a protease. In the classical pathway, the first step is the initiation of the pathway triggered by recognition by complement factor C1 of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface. When C1 complex interacts with aggregates of IgG with antigen on a cell's surface, two C1-associated proteases, C1r and C1s, are activated. Other factors like lipopolysaccharide also activate C1s. Once C1s is activated, it cleaves C4 to form C4b that then binds to the cell",
  "Significant progress has been made towards delineation of the intrinsic molecular processes that regulate B lymphocyte immune function. Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of",
  "Maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract despite the continual presence of microbial flora and injurious agents is essential. Epithelial repair requires restitution and regeneration. During restitution, epithelial cells spread and migrate across the basement membrane to re-establish surface-cell continuity, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Epithelial continuity depends on a family of small abundant secreted proteins, the trefoil factors (TFFs). The trefoil factor (TFF) family comprises the gastric peptides pS2 / TFF1 and spasmolytic peptide (SP) / TFF2, and the intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) / TFF3. Their fundamental action is to promote epithelial-cell restitution within the gastrointestinal tract. TFFs are abundantly secreted onto the mucosal surface by mucus-secreting cells. Their expression is rapidly and coordinately upregulated at the margins of mucosal injury. Secreted TFF acts on adjacent mucosal cell populations either extracellularly (augmenting barrier function) or intracellularly (transcriptional and signalling events). TFF response elements in TFF gene promoters allow increases in TFF expression through auto-induction and cross-induction of other TFFs, in addition to",
  "T cell activation is initiated by recognition of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of Class II MHC on an antigen-presenting cell. The T cell receptor contains multiple subunits and interacts with several factors to transduce antigen-stimulated T cell activation. One of the key steps that initiates receptor activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR subunits by the src family protein kinases Lck and Fyn. T cell receptor phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn recruits the ZAP-70 protein kinase to the receptor complex, which becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways like the Map kinase cascade. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase activates Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating these proteins and is required for TCR activation. Association of the CD4 coreceptor with Lck may also be involved in Lck activation.",
  "The classification of autoimmune throid disease (AITD) includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and its variants, Graves' disease (GD) and autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis or primary myxedema. HT is characterized by the presence of goitre, thyroid autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in serum and varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. During HT, self-reactive CD4 + T lymphocytes (Th) recruit B cells and CD8 + T cells (CTL) into the thyroid. Disease progression leads to the death of thyroid cells and hypothyroidism. Both autoantibodies and thyroid-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been proposed to be responsible for autoimmune thyrocyte depletion. In GD, the TSH-R is the most important autoantigen. Antibodies directed against it mimic the effects of the hormone on thyroid cells, TSH, stimulating autonomous production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine and causing hyperthyroidism. The presence of TSH-R-blocking antibodies that bind the TSH receptor in a similar fashion to the antibodies in patients with Graves' disease but that block rather than activate the receptor explains some cases of atrophic hypothyroidism.",
  "O-glycans are a class of glycans that modify serine or threonine residues of proteins. Biosynthesis of O-glycans starts from the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine. The first GalNAc may be extended with sugars including galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, or sialic acid, but not mannose, glucose, or xylose. Depending on the sugars added, there are four common O-glycan core structures, cores 1 through 4, and an additional four, cores 5 though 8. Mucins are highly O-glycosylated glycoproteins ubiquitous in mucous secretions on cell surfaces and in body fluids. Mucin O-glycans can be branched, and many sugars or groups of sugars are antigenic. Important modifications of mucin O-glycans include O-acetylation of sialic acid and O-sulfation of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine.",
  "Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.",
  "Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) are composed of at least three types of transmembrane protein -occludin, claudin and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) - and a cytoplasmic 'plaque' consisting of many different proteins that form large complexes. The transmembrane proteins mediate cell adhesion and are thought to constitute the intramembrane and paracellular diffusion barriers. The cytoplasmic 'plaque' contains three major multi-protein complexes consisting largely of scaffolding proteins, the ZO protein complex, the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ complex and the PAR-3-aPKC-PAR-6 complex. The ZO protein complex appears to organize the transmembrane proteins and couple them to other cytoplasmic proteins and to actin microfilaments. Two evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, the CRB3 and PAR complexes are involved in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. Besides these three protein complexes which seem to be constitutively associated at TJs, a number of proteins with different functions has been identified at TJs. These include additional scaffolding proteins like MUPP1 and MAGI-1, adaptor proteins, transcription regulators and RNA processing factors, regulatory proteins like small GTPases and G-proteins, kinases",
  "G-aS-coupled receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC), which synthesizes cAMP from ATP. In contrast Gai-coupled receptors inhibit AC and so reduce cAMP formation. The bg subunits from Gai and other G proteins are able to activate the MAP kinase pathways and PLCb. GPCRs coupled to the Gaq family of G proteins stimulate PLCb, which cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce IP3, which mobilizes intracellular calcium, and DAG, which activates PKC. Second messenger pathways then activate a range of effector systems to change cell behaviour; in many cases this includes the regulation of gene transcription. Dotted line shows a more indirect pathway.",
  "Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. This classification has also been justified at the molecular level with Type 1 tumours being more commonly associated with abnormalities of DNA-mismatch repair genes, K-ras, PTEN and beta-catenin, and Type 2 tumours with abnormalities of p53 and HER2 / neu.",
  "Inflammatory immune response requires the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation upon foreign insult. Chemokines are small chemoattractant peptides that provide directional cues for the cell trafficking and thus are vital for protective host response. In addition, chemokines regulate plethora of biological processes of hematopoietic cells to lead cellular activation, differentiation and survival. The chemokine signal is transduced by chemokine receptors (G-protein coupled receptors) expressed on the immune cells. After receptor activation, the alpha- and beta-gamma-subunits of G protein dissociate to activate diverse downstream pathways resulting in cellular polarization and actin reorganization. Various members of small GTPases are involved in this process. Induction of nitric oxide and production of reactive oxygen species are as well regulated by chemokine signal via calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol production.",
  "B cells must communicate with their environment to participate in the immune system as the source of antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates activation of B cells and T cells through dephosphorylation of signaling factors. CD32 is",
  "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine that can lead to cellular activation and proliferation. IL-2 Receptors are found on activated B-Cells, LPS treated Monocytes, and many T cells. The receptor is formed from three chains alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and gamma (CD132). Primary signaling is through the JAK / Stat pathway and MAPKs.",
  "The heparan sulphate proteoglycan agrin is well known as the key assembly factor of postsynaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), but recent data suggest it also plays a direct role in the organization of the cytoskeleton in the skeletal muscle. Signaling through muscle-specific proteins such as muscle specific kinase (MuSK) and or acetylcholine receptor (AchRs) / rapsyn, agrin can activate ubiquitously expressed Rac, Cdc42, and p21-activated kinase (PAK) that are involved in actin polymerization. Agrin also engages signaling pathways of several potent oncogenes (i.e., SFK, ErbB receptors, and cortactin).",
  "Activation of the protease-activated GPCRs in platelets contributes to platelet activation in clotting. The protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved by the protease thrombin, releasing a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor and triggers intracellular calcium release. Platelets from mice lacking the PAR4 gene are not activated by thrombin and are impaired in clotting, supporting the importance of thrombin signaling through PAR4 in clotting. Human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, with PAR1 playing a more dominant role in clotting in humans. Calcium release induced by PARs activates PKC, modulating integrin alpha IIB beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb / IIIa) and opening integrin ligand binding sites to contribute to platelet aggregation. Intracellular calcium increases induced by thrombin activates phospholipase A2, liberating arachidonic acid, the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis. Ras / Map kinase activation by the PAR receptors also activates phospholipase A2. The activation of PAR-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by aspirin, indicating that thromboxane production induced by PAR signaling contributes to platelet activation. Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin PGG2 by the enzyme Cox-1 in platelets, and Cox-1 is",
  "Type I diabetes mellitus is a disease that results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. Certain beta-cell proteins act as autoantigens after being processed by antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and presented in a complex with MHC-II molecules on the surface of the APC. Then immunogenic signals from APC activate CD4 + T cells, predominantly of the Th1 subset. Antigen-activated Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFNgamma. They activate macrophages and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, and these effector cells may kill islet beta-cells by one or both of two types of mechanisms: (1) direct interactions of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells with a beta-cell autoantigen-MHC-I complex on the beta-cell, and (2) non-specific inflammatory mediators, such as free radicals / oxidants and cytokines (IL-1, TNFalpha, TNFbeta, IFNgamma). Type I diabetes is a polygenic disease. One of the principle determining genetic factors in diabetes incidence is the inheritance of mutant MHC-II alleles. Another plausible candidate gene is the insulin gene.",
  "Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cell surface receptors like FAS, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death domain like FAS. The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets. Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis have been suggested.",

  "RXR and RAR are nuclear receptors that bind either all trans retinoic (tRA) or 9cis retinoic acid (9cisRA). In the absence of ligand corepressors with histone deacetylase activity are bound to the RAR / RXR hetrodimer and suppress transcription. Once they bind retinoic acid a conformational change in the receptors cause the dissociation of the corepressors and the binding of coactivators with histone acetylase activity (1). Following ligand binding by the hetrodimer the receptors and proteins in the basal transcription machinery (like TBP and TAF135) are degraded by the proteasome (2).",
  "The role of Hemophilus influenzae in ear infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes the induction of an inflammatory response through activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. In addition to activation of inflammatory cytokine genes like IL-1 and TNF, H. influenzae activates TLR2 expression and genes involved in mucus production. Hemophilus influenzae activates NF-kB by multiple mechanisms, starting with activation of the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by the p16 protein in the H. influenzae outer membrane. TLR2 plays a key role in innate immune responses and is expressed in high levels in lymphoid cells as well as low levels in epithelial cells. The role of TLR2 was supported by blocking NF-kB activation with a dominant negative TLR2 and increasing it with transfection of a normal TLR2 gene. TLR2 in turn activates TAK1, which activates two divergent signaling pathways. One of these pathways leads to IkB kinase activation, IkB phosphorylation and degradation, releasing the NF-kB heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. In the alternate pathway, TAK1 also activates NF-kB through a Map kinase pathway, activating p38 and NF",
  "Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the control of translation by eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). eIF-2 binds GTP and Met-tRNAi and transfers the Met-tRNA to the 40S subunit, to form the 43S preinitiation complex. Later in the cycle, prior to elongation, the bound GTP is hydrolyzed, releasing eIF-2-GDP. For eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, GDP must be exchanged for GTP, a reaction catalyzed by eIF-2B. Kinases activated by viral infection (PKR), endoplasmic reticulum stress (PERK / PEK), amino acid deprivation (GCN2), and hemin deficiency (HRI) can phosphorylate the a subunit of eIF-2. This phosphorylation stabilizes the eIF-2-GDP-eIF-2B complex, inhibiting the turnover of eIF-2B. eIF-2B is also inhibited by GSK-3b phosphorylation. These events result in a shut-down of cellular protein synthesis and can lead to apoptosis.",
  "eIF-4F and p70 S6 kinase play critical roles in translational regulation. eIF-4F is a complex whose functions include the recognition of the mRNA 5 'cap structure (eIF-4E), delivery of an RNA helicase to the 5' region (eIF-4A), bridging of the mRNA and the ribosome (eIF-4G), and circularization of the mRNA via interaction between eIF-4G and the poly (A) binding protein (PABP). Several stimuli, including growth factors and cytokines, regulate the eIF-4 complex and p70 S6 kinase by initiating a phosphorylation cascade involving the sequential activation of PI3-K, PDK1 / 2, Akt / PKB, and FRAP / mTOR kinase. FRAP / mTOR, together with an unidentified kinase, phosphorylates 4E-BP, leading to its dissociation from and activation of eIF-4E. MNK1 / 2, activated by ERK and p38 MAPK, phosphorylates and activates eIF-4E. Both processes contribute to the association of eIF-4E and eIF-4G to form the active eIF-4F complex, a necessary component of the 48S initiation",
  "Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved biological pathway that plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations from becoming permanent in dividing cells. MMR also suppresses homologous recombination and was recently shown to play a role in DNA damage signaling. Defects in MMR are associated with genome-wide instability, predisposition to certain types of cancer including HNPCC, resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, and abnormalities in meiosis and sterility in mammalian systems. The Escherichia coli MMR pathway has been extensively studied and is well characterized. In E. coli, the mismatch-activated MutS-MutL-ATP complex licenses MutH to incise the nearest unmethylated GATC sequence. UvrD and an exonuclease generate a gap. This gap is filled by pol III and DNA ligase. The GATC sites are then methylated by Dam. Several human MMR proteins have been identified based on their homology to E. coli MMR proteins. These include human homologs of MutS and MutL. Although E. coli MutS and MutL proteins are homodimers, human MutS and MutL homologs are heterodimers. The role of hemim",
  "The Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway involving eight enzymes essential for energy production through aerobic respiration, and, like glycolysis, arose early in evolution. This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl",
  "All taste pathways are proposed to converge on common elements that mediate a rise in intracellular Ca2 + followed by neurotransmitter release. Na + salt depolarizes taste cells by passive influx of Na + through the amiloride-sensitive Na + channel (ENaC). Acids depolarize taste cells by a variety of mechanisms, including influx of protons (H +) through ENaC and a proton-gated cation channel (MDEG). Two putative umami receptors have been identified: a truncated variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 and the heterodimer, T1R1 + T1R3. Umami receptors are coupled to a signaling pathway involving activation of PLCbeta2, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activation of a transient receptor potential channel, TRPM5. Bitter compounds, such as denatonium and PROP, activate particular T2R / TRB isoforms, which activate gustducin heterotrimers. Activated alpha-gustducin stimulates PDE to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas betagamma subunits activate PLCbeta2 to generate IP3, which leads to release of Ca2 + from internal stores. Artificial sweeteners activate GPCRs (",
  "Terminal differentiation of cells is often accompanied by repression of cellular proliferation, suggesting that there is a mechanism by which these cellular functions are coordinated. Macrophage differentiation is one model system in which this occurs; as macrophages differentiate, they also stop proliferating. Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in cell cycle progression as well as many differentiation processes. Ras stimulates cell cycle progression in part through Ets transcription factors that bind to cell cycle regulatory genes to activate their expression. Ets transcription factors also help to induce early macrophage differentiation. The activation of Ras signaling by M-CSF activates transcription of genes involved in differentiation through the coordinate expression of both Ets factors and AP-1. Other genes involved in cell cycle regulation involved the coordinate action of E2F-1 and Ets transcription factors. Mets is a factor related in sequence to Ets2 that is upregulated during macrophage differentiation. Increased expression of the Mets protein during macrophage differentiation allows the creation of heterodimers with DP103 to act as transcriptional repressors of cell cycle progression genes, recruiting corepressor to promoters they interact with. DP103 is a gene previously identified as an RNA helicase involved in RNA",
  "The mammalian calpain gene family curently contains 13 distinct large subunit products most of which complex with one of two smaller 30kDa subunits. (An excellent introduction to the Calpain family can be found on a web site created by Valery Thompson http: / / ag.arizona.edu / calpains / index.html) Spreading cells display newly transiently formed integrin adhesion clusters containing Calpain1 (mu-Calpain), cleaved Talin, B3-Integrin and SPTAN1 (Spectrin). Recruitment of Rac to these clusters leads to the activation of Rac and the formation of Rac-induced Focal clusters. The Calpain1 in the integrin clusters initially inactivates RhoA allowing for the formation of lamellipodia. The subsequent activation of newly synthesized RhoA transforms these clusters into Focal Adhesion Complexes and the formation of contractile actin-myosin stress fibers. These mature adhesions do not contain calpain.",
  "There is now much evidence that VEGFR-2 is the major mediator of VEGF-driven responses in endothelial cells and it is considered to be a crucial signal transducer in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to a cascade of different signaling pathways, resulting in the up-regulation of genes involved in mediating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and promoting their survival and vascular permeability. For example, the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to dimerization of the receptor, followed by intracellular activation of the PLCgamma; PKC-Raf kinase-MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth, whereas activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway leads to increased endothelial-cell survival. Activation of PI3K, FAK, and p38 MAPK is implicated in cell migration signaling.",
  "In the kidney, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) is a critical regulator of water homeostasis by controlling the water movement from lumen to the interstitium for water reabsorption and adjusting the urinary water excretion. In normal physiology, AVP is secreted into the circulation by the posterior pituitary gland, in response to an increase in serum osmolality or a decrease in effective circulating volume. When reaching the kidney, AVP binds to V2 receptors on the basolateral surface of the collecting duct epithelium, triggering a G-protein-linked signaling cascade, which leads to water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) vesicle insertion into the apical plasma membrane. This results in higher water permeability in the collecting duct and, driven by an osmotic gradient, pro-urinary water then passes the membrane through AQP2 and leaves the cell on the basolateral side via AQP3 and AQP4 water channels, which are constitutively expressed on the basolateral side of these cells. When isotonicity is restored, reduced blood AVP levels results in AQP2 internalization, leaving the apical membrane watertight again.",
  "Contraction of the heart is a complex process initiated by the electrical excitation of cardiac myocytes (excitation-contraction coupling, ECC). In cardiac myocytes, Ca2 + influx induced by activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (DHP receptors) upon membrane depolarization triggers the release of Ca2 + via Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through a Ca2 + -induced Ca release (CICR) mechanism. Ca2 + ions released via the CICR mechanism diffuse through the cytosolic space to contractile proteins to bind to troponinC resulting in the release of inhibition induced by troponinI. The Ca2 + binding to troponinC thereby triggers the sliding of thin and thick filaments, that is, the activation of a crossbridge and subsequent cardiac force development and / or cell shortening. Recovery occurs as Ca2 + is pumped out of the cell by the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) or is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by sarco (endo) plasmic Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) pumps on the non-junctional region of the SR.",
  "The vitamin D receptor, VDR is the mediator of all genomic actions of vitamin D3 and its analogs. It belongs to a family of ligand induced transcription factors, nuclear receptors (NRs). Vitamin D3 is the main regulator of calcium homeostasis and is critical in bone formation. It is also involved in controlling cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis, which makes synthetic vitamin D3 analogues interesting for therapy of such diseases as cancer and psoriasis. NRs are comprised of: an amino-terminal activation function domain AF-1; the DNA-binding domain; a hinge region; and a carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain containing a second activation function, AF-2. VDR acts primarily as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on vitamin D response elements (VDREs). It interacts with the transcription machinery and nuclear receptor coactivators or corepressors to regulate target gene activity. NRs coregulators can be divided into 3 major classes: 1) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that are involved in the location and association of nucleosomes with DNA; 2) Enzymes that catalyze modifications of histone tails to regulate histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions",
  "Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would",
  "The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes that catalyze conjunction of glutathione with harmful, electrophilic molecules, thereby protecting cells from carcinogenic factors. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by such carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. After therapeutic reduction in the levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer has been associated with mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) that permit receptor activation by other ligands, increased expression of androgen receptors accompanying AR amplification, and ligand-independent androgen-receptor activation.",
  "Skeletal muscle atrophies with disuse while with increased use and increased load skeletal muscle exhibits hypertrophy, with an increase in the size of existing muscle fibers. One signaling pathway involved in regulating skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy is the AKT / mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway activity increases in response to muscle activity during hypertrophy and decreases in activity during atrophy. Blocking this pathway genetically or with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks hypertrophy and genetic activation of the pathway induces hypertrophy. One agent that promotes muscle hypertrophy is the growth factor IGF-1. IGF-1 activates AKT, GSK-3beta and mTOR to promote hypertrophy. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway is not involved in hypertrophy and is down-regulated by agents such as IGF-1 that promote hypertrophy. Calcineurin may modulate other aspects of muscle function such as the development of slow muscle fibers through transcriptional regulation. These pathways lead to regulation of protein translation, with increased translation apparently acting as a key regulatory point in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Agents such as IGF-1 that stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy may provide treatments for muscle atrophy and wasting.",
  "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), two neuropeptides present in the lymphoid microenvironment, elicit a broad spectrum of biological functions, including the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Another important immunoregulatory function of VIP and PACAP is their inhibition effect on AICD in T cells. They inhibit the TCR-stimulated FasL expression and apoptosis of T cell through specific receptors and induction of intracellular cAMP. VIP down-regulate c-Myc synthesis, the NF-AT-dependent Egr2 and Egr3 expression, the NF-AT and NF-kB.",
  "E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and that is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1 into S phase. Over-expression of E2F-1 can induce cellular transformation and its under-expression can repress apoptosis. Association with the tumor suppressor Rb represses E2F-1 activity, and this repression is relieved when the cdk2 / cyclin E complex at the G1 to S phase transition phosphorylates Rb. Like many cell cycle regulators, E2F-1 is regulated through phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, cdk2 / cyclin A, and by proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of E2F-1 by cdk2 / cyclin A leads to E2F-1 inactivation, blocking DNA binding. E2F-1 is also regulated through degradation in the proteosome at the S / G2 transition. The F box complex that degrades E2F-1 contains components shared with the complexes that target other cell cycle factors for degradation. The F box protein that specifically recruits E2F for ubiquitination and degradation is Skp2. Other components of the SCF complex include Skp1, Cul1, and cdc34. Skp2 expression is cyclical,",

Agrin also engages signaling pathways of several potent oncogenes (i.e., SFK, ErbB receptors, and cortactin).",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged / Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc) -co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.",
  "Activation of T lymphocytes is a key event for an efficient response of the immune system. It requires the involvement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD28. Engagement of these receptors through the interaction with a foreign antigen associated with major histocompatibility complex molecules and CD28 counter-receptors B7.1 / B7.2, respectively, results in a series of signaling cascades. These cascades comprise an array of protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, GTP-binding proteins and adaptor proteins that regulate generic and specialised functions, leading to T-cell proliferation, cytokine production and differentiation into effector cells.",
  "Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a biphasic disease, initiated by expression of the BCR / ABL fusion gene product in self-renewing, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs can differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), which then differentiate into granulocyte / macrophage progenitors (GMPs). HSCs can also differentiate into common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which are the progenitors of lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells. The initial chronic phase of CML (CML-CP) is characterized by a massive expansion of the granulocytic-cell series. Acquisition of additional genetic mutations beyond expression of BCR / ABL causes the progression of CML from chronic phase to blast phase (CML-BP), characterized by an accumulation of myeloid or lymphoid blast cells. The BCR / ABL fusion gene encodes p210BCR / ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The tyrosine kinase activity is essential for cell transformation and the cytoplasmic localization of BCR / ABL allows the assembly of phosphorylated substrates in multiprotein complexes that transmit",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, which include TGF-betas, activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are structurally related secreted cytokines found in species ranging from worms and insects to mammals. A wide spectrum of cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration are regulated by TGF-beta family members. TGF-beta family member binds to the Type II receptor and recruits Type I, whereby Type II receptor phosphorylates and activates Type I. The Type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads: Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8). Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and the heteromeric complex then translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Smad complexes activate specific genes through cooperative interactions with other DNA-binding and coactivator (or co-repressor) proteins.",
  "The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer",
  "The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily contains several members with homologous cytoplasmic domains known as death domains (DD). The intracellular DD are important in initiating apoptosis and other signaling pathways following ligand binding by the receptors.1 In the absence of ligand, DD-containing receptors are maintained in an inactive state. TNF RI contains a cytoplasmic DD required for signaling pathways associated with apoptosis and NF-kB activation.2,3 Jiang et al.4 identified a widely expressed 60 kDa protein, named SODD (silencer of death domains), associated with the DD of TNF RI and DR3. Overexpression of SODD suppresses TNF-induced cell death and NF-kB activation demonstrating its role as a negative regulatory protein for these signaling pathways. TNF-induced receptor trimerization aggregates the DD of TNF RI and recruits the adapter protein TRADD.3,5 This in turn promotes the recruitment of the DD-containing cytoplasmic proteins FADD, TRAF2 and RIP to form an active TNF RI signaling complex (Figure 1A) .6-9 In contrast, SODD acts as a silencer of TNF RI signaling and does not interact with TRADD,",
  "One of responses to increased blood pressure is cardiac hypertrophy through increased size of ventricular myocardial cells leading to increased thickness of the ventricular walls. Cardiac hypertrophy allows the heart to handle the increased stress caused by elevated blood pressure but is also a risk factor associated with heart disease. Cardiac hypertrophy results from cross-talk between G-protein coupled receptor signaling and the EGF receptor pathway. Several GPCR ligands are known to stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, including factors that regulate blood pressure such as angiotensin II and endothelin- 1. These factors stimulate phospholipase C through Gq activation, and the production of 1P3 and diacylglycerol second messengers. PKC-delta is activated by DAG and interacts with the metalloproteinase ADAM12. ADAM12 cleaves the membrane-bound HB-EGF to release soluble EGF ligand that activates EGF receptor in myocardial cells. EGF receptor activation downstream through small G proteins and the MAP kinase pathway ultimately leads to cardiac hypertrophy. Signals by GPCR ligands such as angiotensin II result in transcriptional translation of immediate early genes like fos and other genes involved in long-term remodeling of heart tissue and the physiological response to stress in the heart such as the atrial natriuretic",
  "Blood-cell development progresses from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), which can undergo either self-renewal or differentiation into a multilineage committed progenitor cell: a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) or a common myeloid progenitor (CMP). A CLP gives rise to the lymphoid lineage of white blood cells or leukocytes-the natural killer (NK) cells and the T and B lymphocytes. A CMP gives rise to the myeloid lineage, which comprises the rest of the leukocytes, the erythrocytes (red blood cells), and the megakaryocytes that produce platelets important in blood clotting. Cells undergoing these differentiation process express a stage- and lineage-specific set of surface markers. Therefore cellular stages are identified by the specific expression patterns of these genes.",
  "Oxidative stress is one factor that can trigger programmed cell death. Activated neutrophils responding to inflammatory stimulation produce reactive oxygen species like superoxide free radicals to kill invading bacteria, but these reactive oxygen species can also attack endothelial cells lining the vascular wall and trigger apoptosis. Endothelial cells also produce reactive oxygen species inside the cell that can contribute to oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as during reperfusion injury following ischemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts highly reactive and damaging superoxide free radicals to peroxides that are less reactive than superoxide but stimulate apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) peptide reducing agent removes toxic metabolites and repairs damage created by reactive oxygen species. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), for example, removes peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent, and glutathione reductase (GSR) regenerates reduced glutathione. Inside the endothelial cell peroxide can be converted to hydroxyl ions in the presence of iron. Peroxides and hydroxyl radicals activate NF-kB and activate expression of inflammatory genes including adhesion molecules, TNF and IL-8. The apoptotic response of endothelial cells to oxidative stress may be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",
  "Pathogenic Salmonella enter cells such as those of the intestinal epithelium by altering cellular cytoskeletal structure and inducing membrane ruffling of the infected cell. Salmonella is able to alter the cytoskeleton and membrane through the action of secreted bacterial Sip proteins, SopE, SopB, and SptP that are inserted into the cytosol of the infected cell. Sip proteins encoded by Salmonella are required for the action of SopE and for the invasion of epithelial cells. SipA stabilizes actin filaments, inducing membrane ruffling and perhaps focusing membrane changes where bacteria are localized to allow their entry. SipC produces a similar effect on actin filaments and cytoskeletal structure. SopE acts as an exchange factor on Rac1 and Cdc42, two GTPases in the Rho family that regulate actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 by Salmonella SopE induces changes in cytoskeleton structure that allow bacterial entry into the cell. SopB is another salmonella protein that acts as an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and also stimulates Cdc42 and Rac1. One of the cellular targets of both Cdc42 and Rac1 that affects actin structure is the Arp2 / 3 complex. Cdc",
  "The ever evolving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways consist of four major groupings and numerous related proteins which constitute interrelated signal transduction cascades activated by stimuli such as growth factors, stress, cytokines and inflammation. The four major groupings are the Erk (red), JNK or SAPK (blue), p38 (green) and the Big MAPK or ERK5 (light blue) cascades. Signals from cell surface receptors such as GPCRs and growth factor receptors are transduced, directly or via small G proteins such as ras and rac, to multiple tiers of protein kinases that amplify these signals and / or regulate each other. The diagram is organized to illustrate the cascades by the background colors and also the tiers of kinases as indicated down the left hand side and separated by the horizontal dashed lines. In some cascades the first activation tier involves the MAPKKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases or MAP4K proteins. The next tier are the serine / threonine MAPKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase or MAP3Ks such as RAF, TAK, ASK, and MEKK1. This level has the greatest amount of cross-communication cu",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM (familial DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of familial DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an idiopathic DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of idiopathic DCM focus on chronic viral myocarditis and / or on autoimmune abnormalities. Viral myocarditis may progress to an autoimmune phase and then to progressive cardiac dilatation. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with idiopathic DCM, may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2 +, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.",
  "Role of -arrestins in the desensitization, sequestration and intracellular trafficking of GPCRs. Homologous desensitization of GPCRs (1) results from the binding of -arrestins (-arr) to agonist -occupied receptors following phosphorylation of the receptor by GRKs. -arrestin binding sterically precludes coupling between the receptor and heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to termination of signaling by G proteins effectors. Receptor-bound -arrestins also act as adapter proteins, binding to components of the clathrin endocytic machinery including clathrin, 2-adaptin (AP-2). Receptor sequestration (2) reflects the dynamin (Dyn) -dependent endocytosis of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits. Once internalized, GPCRs exhibit two distinct patterns of -arrestin interaction. `Class A 'GPCRs, for example the 2 adrenergic receptor, rapidly dissociate from -arrestin upon internalization. These receptors are trafficked to an acidified endosomal compartment, wherein the ligand is dissociated and the receptor dephosphorylated by a GPCR-specific protein phosphatase PP2A isoform, and are subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane (3). `Class B' receptors, for example the angiotensin II AT1a receptor, form stable receptor--arrestin",
  "After transcription, eukaryotic mRNA precursors contain protein-coding exons and noncoding introns. In the following splicing, introns are excised and exons are joined by a macromolecular complex, the spliceosome. The standard spliceosome is made up of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, and several spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs). Spliceosomes are not a simple stable complex, but a dynamic family of particles that assemble on the mRNA precursor and help fold it into a conformation that allows transesterification to proceed. Various spliceosome forms (e.g. A-, B- and C-complexes) have been identified.",
  "The insulin resistance of type II diabetes appears to be caused in part by the presence of high levels of lipids in cells such as skeletal muscle where this would not normally be found. The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import",
  "For a T cell to be activated by a specific antigen, the T cell receptor must recognize complexes of MHCI with the antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. T cells and the T cell receptor complex do not respond to antigen in solution, but even for the specific antigen they only respond to antigen-MHC-1 complexes on the cell surface. This interaction is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. T cell activation also requires a co-stimulatory signal involving interaction of CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 family genes) on the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 activates a signal transduction pathway acting through PI-3K, Lck and Grb-2 / ITK to provide its co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation. Another means to control T cell activation is by expressing factors that down-regulate T cell activation. Signaling by activated T cell receptors induces expression of CTLA-4, a receptor that opposes T cell activation. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity than CD28 for B7 proteins, terminating T cell activation.",
  "Ras activates many signaling cascades. Here we illustrate some of the well-characterized cascades in a generic compilation of effector molecules. The effectors mediate Ras stimulation to a diverse set of cellular signals. Many of these signals are interpreted differently depending on the cell type or microenvironment receiving the stimulus. Not all of these effectors are activated in any given cell type. The primary method of activation is to promote the translocation of the molecule to the plasma membrane where additional interactions lead to the activation of the molecule. RalGDS is a Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF) for Ral but also has other independent functions. RalGDS activates RalA / B-related small GTPases. RalBP1 is a GTPase activating protein that leads to the inhibition of the Rac and CDC42 GTPases. Ral can also interact with phospholipase D1 (PLD1) that can also be activated by RhoA. Ras stimulation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3K occurs through an interaction with the p110 catalytic subunit. PI3K phosphorylates the D3 position of phosphatidylinositides. In this example Pip2 is converted to PIP3. PIP3 stimulates the AKT / PKB kinase and several of the Rac",
  "Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy, is the molecular basis for learning and memory. Tetanic stimulation of afferents in the CA1 region of the hippocampus induces glutamate release and activation of glutamate receptors in dendritic spines. A large increase in i resulting from influx through NMDA receptors leads to constitutive activation of CaM kinase II (CaM KII). Constitutively active CaM kinase II phosphorylates AMPA receptors, resulting in potentiation of the ionic conductance of AMPA receptors. Early-phase LTP (E-LTP) expression is due, in part, to this phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized that postsynaptic Ca2 + increases generated through NMDA receptors activate several signal transduction pathways including the Erk / MAP kinase and cAMP regulatory pathways. The convergence of these pathways at the level of the CREB / CRE transcriptional pathway may increase expression of a family of genes required for late-phase LTP (L-LTP).",
  "The activation of T cells requires a co-stimulatory signal with T cell receptor activation, provided in many cases by activation of CD28 in resting T cells. 4-1BB (CD137) is a member of the TNF receptor gene family that provides another T cell co-stimulatory signal. 4-1BB is expressed by activated cytotoxic and helper T cells and its expression is induced by a variety of T cell stimuli, including activation of the T cell receptor or stimulation with mitogens. The ligand for 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is induced on activated antigen-presenting cells including macrophages, activating T cells expressing 4-1BB. Mice lacking 4-1BB survive and have an altered though functional immune response. T cells of mice lacking 4-1BB proliferate more rapidly than normal T cells, but have reduced cytokine secretion. The costimulatory signal provided by 4-1BB may act in combination with CD28 activation to prolong the T cell response, and may also act independently of CD28. Stimulation of T cells with the 4-1BB ligand may provide a therapeutic immune response in the treatment of cancer or",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) provide a potent proliferative signaling system that stimulates growth in many different cell types and blocks apoptosis. In vivo IGF-1 acts as an intermediate of many growth hormone responses, and may stimulate the growth of some types of cancer. IGF-1 also provides a mitogenic signal to act as a growth factor for many tissue culture cells. One component of IGF-1 mitogenic signaling is association of the receptor tyrosine kinase with Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1 to activate ras and the Map kinase cascade (raf, Mek, Erk). An endpoint of the Map kinase pathway is modification of transcription factor activity, such as activation of ELK transcription factors. Serum response factor (SRF) and AP-1 contribute to mitogenic signaling by many factors. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI3 kinase activation are also involved in IGF-1 signaling, similar to insulin signaling.",
  "TACI and BCMA signal transduction pathway that enhances cell survival APRIL and BAFF (also called TALL-I and BLyS) are TNF family members that act as ligands for the BCMA and TACI receptors. Both APRIL and BAFF bind to both the BCMA and TACI receptors to activate the humoral immune response, stimulating B cell immunoglobulin production and proliferation. BAFF is found as a membrane bound form in T cells and a soluble form that is released from the cell to stimulate B cell proliferation and differentiation. As members of the TNF receptor gene family, BCMA and TACI interact with TRAF family members to transduce signals downstream to NF-kappaB activation and MAP kinase pathways. Abnormally active BAFF or APRIL signaling may play a role in autoimmune disorders such as lupus.",
  "As with many cell-surface receptors, activation of the EGF receptor can result in receptor internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis, desensitizing further receptor signaling. This process requires clathrin and occurs in clathrin-coated pits, which pinch off from the plasma membrane to form vesicles that move to the early endosome. From the early endosome, receptors can either be recycled back to the cell surface, or they can move through the late endosome to the lysosome for proteolytic degradation. The sorting of receptors in the early endosome for degradation requires the tyrosine kinase activity of activated growth factor receptor, and involves ubiquitination of the receptor. Targeting of receptors for degradation requires members of the Cbl gene family. Cbl proteins bind to tyrosine phosphorylated EGF receptor, and are E3 ubiquitination ligases that label receptor for degradation. Cbl also recruits Cin85 to the receptor complex, and blocking Cin85 interaction blocks receptor internalization and degradation. Endophilins are also a member of this receptor-bound protein complex. In its role as a ubiquitin ligase and docking protein, Cbl desensitizes EGF signaling and also opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF. EGF activation also appears to",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR has three subtypes (PPARalpha, beta / delta, and gamma) showing different expression patterns in vertebrates. Each of them is encoded in a separate gene and binds fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPARalpha plays a role in the clearance of circulating or cellular lipids via the regulation of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. PPARbeta / delta is involved in lipid oxidation and cell proliferation. PPARgamma promotes adipocyte differentiation to enhance blood glucose uptake.",
  "The cellular activation of the caspase cascade resulting in cell death is triggered by chemical damage to DNA which stimulates a sequence resulting in the cleavage of Bid in a manner similar to the binding of so called death-receptors or directly initiates the permeability transition of the mitochondrial membrane. The permiability transition releases several factors including cytochrome c, AIF and other factors in to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase cascade. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death.",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting various pathogens and generating innate immune responses. The intracellular NOD-like receptor (NLR) family contains more than 20 members in mammals and plays a pivotal role in the recognition of intracellular ligands. NOD1 and NOD2, two prototypic NLRs, sense the cytosolic presence of the bacterial peptidoglycan fragments that escaped from endosomal compartments, driving the activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, cytokine production and apoptosis. On the other hand, a different set of NLRs induces caspase-1 activation through the assembly of multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. These NLRs include NALP1, NALP3 and Ipaf. The inflammasomes are critical for generating mature proinflammatory cytokines in concert with Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.",
  "Migration of cells is involved in essential functions such as development, invasiveness of cancer cells, leukocyte movement toward chemotactic signals, and fibroblast response to injury. Cells can migrate in a specific direction in response to extracellular signals through pathways that trigger changes in the cytoskeleton, particularly actin filaments, increasing lamellipodia and filopodia formation and decreasing focal adhesions. Factors like PDGF activate PI3 kinase and multiple pathways downstream to stimulate cell migration. One pathway regulating migration through the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase does not require PI3-kinase activity. In this pathway, p85 of PI3-kinase activates cdc42, which activates N-Wasp (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) to regulate ARP-2 / 3. ARP-2 / 3 is a complex of proteins localized at the leading edge of moving cells that nucleates the formation of new actin fibers and interacts with Wasp to stimulate migration. The cdc42 pathway also regulates p21-activate kinase 1 (PAK1). Another pathway by which PI3 kinase regulates migration is through the small GTPase Rac. PAK1 is a downstream target of Rac as well as",
  "Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and various autoimmune diseases. The activation of NF-kB is thought to be part of a stress response as it is activated by a variety of stimuli that include growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines, UV, pharmacological agents, and stress. In its inactive form, NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the IkB family of inhibitor proteins, which include IkBa, IkBb, IkBg, and IkBe. The various stimuli that activate NF-kB cause phosphorylation of IkB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-kB subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds with a consensus sequence (5'GGGACTTTCC-3 ') of various genes and thus activates their transcription. IkB proteins are phosphorylated by IkB kinase complex",
  "Activation of the protease-activated GPCRs in platelets contributes to platelet activation in clotting. The protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved by the protease thrombin, releasing a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor and triggers intracellular calcium release. Platelets from mice lacking the PAR4 gene are not activated by thrombin and are impaired in clotting, supporting the importance of thrombin signaling through PAR4 in clotting. Human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, with PAR1 playing a more dominant role in clotting in humans. Calcium release induced by PARs activates PKC, modulating integrin alpha IIB beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb / IIIa) and opening integrin ligand binding sites to contribute to platelet aggregation. Intracellular calcium increases induced by thrombin activates phospholipase A2, liberating arachidonic acid, the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis. Ras / Map kinase activation by the PAR receptors also activates phospholipase A2. The activation of PAR-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by aspirin, indicating that thromboxane production induced by PAR signaling contributes to platelet activation. Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin PGG2 by the enzyme Cox-1 in platelets, and Cox-1 is",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. The GnRHR is coupled to Gq / 11 proteins to activate phospholipase C which transmits its signal to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates the intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and IP3 stimulates release of intracellular calcium. In addition to the classical Gq / 11, coupling of Gs is occasionally observed in a cell-specific fashion. Signaling downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Active MAPKs translocate to the nucleus, resulting in activation of transcription factors and rapid induction of early genes.",
  "Inflammation is a complex response involving many different cells and signaling molecules, including the secretion of the cytokine IL-17 by activated T cells. IL-17 secretion is restricted to specific subsets of T cells but the receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed throughout the body, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders. Fibroblasts and other cells stimulated by IL-17 are induced themselves to secrete inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). These cytokines in turn provoke a range of activities, including the stimulation of neutrophil proliferation and differentiation.",
  "Mef2 pathway.",
  "Bone density and structure is maintained through a balance of bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone deposition by osteoblasts. The combination of simultaneous resorption and deposition creates continual remodeling of bone while excess osteoclast activity leads to an imbalance and a loss of bone density, causing osteoporosis. RANK (receptor activator of NF-kB ligand) is a receptor in the TNF receptor gene family that is involved in osteoclast differentiation. RANK-ligand, also called osteoprotegerin-ligand, binds to RANK, induces receptor dimerization, and activates downstream signaling. Osteoprotegerin is a decoy receptor for RANK-ligand that suppresses osteoclast activity and bone remodeling, helping to maintain balanced bone remodeling. RANK-ligand and osteoprotegerin are produced by osteoblasts and some factors regulate osteoclast activity indirectly through their action on the expression of these factors by osteoblasts. Binding of RANK-ligand to RANK activates signaling through TRAF-6. TRAF-6 induces several downstream signaling events, including activation of NF-kB, c-Fos and the kinase JNK1. Jnk-1 activation contribute to fos activation by RANK-ligand and may be involved in the modulation of RANK-ligand by other factors such as estrogen",
  "Oxidative stress is one factor that can trigger programmed cell death. Activated neutrophils responding to inflammatory stimulation produce reactive oxygen species like superoxide free radicals to kill invading bacteria, but these reactive oxygen species can also attack endothelial cells lining the vascular wall and trigger apoptosis. Endothelial cells also produce reactive oxygen species inside the cell that can contribute to oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as during reperfusion injury following ischemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts highly reactive and damaging superoxide free radicals to peroxides that are less reactive than superoxide but stimulate apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) peptide reducing agent removes toxic metabolites and repairs damage created by reactive oxygen species. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), for example, removes peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent, and glutathione reductase (GSR) regenerates reduced glutathione. Inside the endothelial cell peroxide can be converted to hydroxyl ions in the presence of iron. Peroxides and hydroxyl radicals activate NF-kB and activate expression of inflammatory genes including adhesion molecules, TNF and IL-8. The apoptotic response of endothelial cells to oxidative stress may be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",
  "The body gets energy through the oxidation of food such as glucose and fatty acids. The chemical energy contained in these foods is extracted and converted until it reaches a common form, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable and is coupled to a variety of energetically unfavorable processes to drive them forward. How is the energy of glucose captured and converted to make ATP? Most of the energy of glucose or fatty acids is extracted through oxidation to produce the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. From there, the energy is transferred next to the electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chain includes a series of protein complexes and non-membrane cofactors that transfer the electrons from NADH and FADH2 in a series of redox reactions from carrier to carrier. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the chain, resulting in the production of water. The oxygen we breath, and which is transported by hemoglobin in the blood to all of the tissues, serves this purpose and allows electron transport to occur. As the electrons pass through the chain, they transfer their energy to",
  "Axon guidance represents a key stage in the formation of neuronal network. Axons are guided by a variety of guidance factors, such as netrins, ephrins, Slits, and semaphorins. These guidance cues are read by growth cone receptors, and signal transduction pathways downstream of these receptors converge onto the Rho GTPases to elicit changes in cytoskeletal organization that determine which way the growth cone will turn.",
  "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS and c-erbB-2, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1",
  "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) eliminates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by direct ligation. NHEJ involves binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs (MRX complex in yeast), processing of ends, and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV (LIG4) -XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation. A recent study shows that bacteria accomplish NHEJ using just two proteins (Ku and DNA ligase), whereas eukaryotes require many factors. NHEJ repairs DSBs at all stages of the cell cycle, bringing about the ligation of two DNA DSBs without the need for sequence homology, and so is error-prone.",
  "Cardiovascular diseases are predicted to be the most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The major regulator of blood pressure homeostasis is the renin-angiotensis system. Angiotensinogen is digested by renin to produce angiotensin I (AGT I). AGT I is an inactive 10 amino-acid peptide that is further degraded to produce angiotensin II by the agiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensis II is the master regulator of blood pressure increase acting on the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin II causes direct constriction of the resistance vessels and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to increase blood volume and sodium absorption. In 2000, Tipnis et al., discovered ACE 2 a second carboxypeptidase that digests angiotensin. ACE is a di-peptidase, cleaving off 2 peptides from the c-terminal end of angiotensin. ACE 2 only cleaves 1 amino acid to produce angiotensin 1-9 (AGT 1-9) which has no identified function at this time. AGT 1-9 is not converted to angiotensin II but further degraded by ACE to AGT 1-7, a vasodilator. It would",
  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is one of a family of three secreted proteins, including Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh), that play distinct and crucial roles in development. The morphogenic signal Shh provides in the developing CNS induces proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum and other tissues. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas, while activation of Shh signaling in neurons may also provide a means to induce neuronal regeneration. Mitogenic Shh signaling does not appear to involve Map kinase pathways, but may involve induction of Cyclin D1 expression to maintain Rb in the hyperphosphorylated state and allow progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Activation of myc may be one mechanism by which Shh induces cell cycle progression. Activation of Shh proliferative signaling occurs through binding to a receptor complex including Patched (Ptc-1) and Smoothened, a G-protein coupled receptor. Patched is an integral membrane protein with twelve transmembrane domains that acts as an inhibitor of Smoothened activation. Patched has been classified",
  "Pathogenic Salmonella enter cells such as those of the intestinal epithelium by altering cellular cytoskeletal structure and inducing membrane ruffling of the infected cell. Salmonella is able to alter the cytoskeleton and membrane through the action of secreted bacterial Sip proteins, SopE, SopB, and SptP that are inserted into the cytosol of the infected cell. Sip proteins encoded by Salmonella are required for the action of SopE and for the invasion of epithelial cells. SipA stabilizes actin filaments, inducing membrane ruffling and perhaps focusing membrane changes where bacteria are localized to allow their entry. SipC produces a similar effect on actin filaments and cytoskeletal structure. SopE acts as an exchange factor on Rac1 and Cdc42, two GTPases in the Rho family that regulate actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 by Salmonella SopE induces changes in cytoskeleton structure that allow bacterial entry into the cell. SopB is another salmonella protein that acts as an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and also stimulates Cdc42 and Rac1. One of the cellular targets of both Cdc42 and Rac1 that affects actin structure is the Arp2 / 3 complex. Cdc",
  "During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation, called meiosis I and meiosis II. At meiosis I, homologous chromosomes recombine and then segregate to opposite poles, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In vertebrates, immature oocytes are arrested at the PI (prophase of meiosis I). The resumption of meiosis is stimulated by progesterone, which carries the oocyte through two consecutive M-phases (MI and MII) to a second arrest at MII. The key activity driving meiotic progression is the MPF (maturation-promoting factor), a heterodimer of CDC2 (cell division cycle 2 kinase) and cyclin B. In PI-arrested oocytes, MPF is initially inactive and is activated by the dual-specificity CDC25C phosphatase as the result of new synthesis of Mos induced by progesterone. MPF activation mediates the transition from the PI arrest to MI. The subsequent decrease in MPF levels, required to exit from MI into interkinesis, is induced by a negative feedback loop, where CDC2 brings about the activation of the APC (anaphase-promoting complex), which mediates",
  "TGF-beta regulates growth and proliferation of cells, blocking growth of many cell types. The TGF-beta receptor includes type 1 and type 2 subunits that are serine-threonine kinases and that signal through the SMAD family of transcriptional regulators. Defects in TGF-beta signaling, includes mutation in SMADs, have been associated with cancer in humans. Prior to activation, receptor regulated SMADs are anchored to the cell membrane by factors like SARA (SMAD Anchor for Receptor Activation) that brings the SMADs into proximity of the TGF receptor kinases. Binding of TGF induces phosphorylation and activation of the TGF-beta R1 receptor by the TGF-beta R2 receptor. The activated TGF-beta R1 phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3, which bind to the SMAD4 mediator to move into the nucleus and form complexes that regulate transcription. SMADs regulate transcription in several ways, including binding to DNA, interacting with other transcription factors, and interacting with transcription corepressors and coactivators like p300 and CBP. SMAD-7 represses signaling by other SMADs to down-regulate the system. Other signaling pathways like the MAP kinase-ERK cascade are activated",
  "After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",
  "The complement system is part of the defense against invading cells and is composed of about twenty different proteins found in the plasma. When activated, complement proteins form a pathway of proteolytic reactions that culminates in the lysis of foreign cells. The complement system also stimulates phagocytosis of foreign cells and an inflammatory response. There are two different complement systems, the classical complement pathway initiated by antibody complexes on the cell surface, and an alternative complement pathway that is initiated without antibodies. The complement system proteins are named with a capital C followed by a number. A small letter after the number indicates that the protein is a smaller protein resulting from the cleavage of a larger precursor by a protease. In the classical pathway, the first step is the initiation of the pathway triggered by recognition by complement factor C1 of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface. When C1 complex interacts with aggregates of IgG with antigen on a cell's surface, two C1-associated proteases, C1r and C1s, are activated. Other factors like lipopolysaccharide also activate C1s. Once C1s is activated, it cleaves C4 to form C4b that then binds to the cell",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an example of lipid messengers with both intracellular and extracellular functions. Intracellularly S1P regulates proliferation and survival; extracellularly S1P is a ligand for EDG1 (also known as S1P1). Activation of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine, increases cellular levels of S1P. Inhibitors of SPHK block formation of S1P and inhibit cellular proliferation induced by a variety of factors, including as an example platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PMA. In a study using endothelial cells it was demonstrated that S1P induces activation of alpha-v and B3 integrins via RhoA. S1P also activates Akt via Gi and PI3K. The activated Akt phosphorlyates the Edg1 receptor on threonine 236 leading to the activation of Rac1 and subsequent signals leading to actin assembly, chemotaxis and lamellipodia formation. Edg1 stimulation also leads to the activation of the ERK signaling cascade resulting in anti-apoptotic reversal, proliferation and cell survival.",
  "Mammalian cells can respond to a variety of stresses such as heat, cold, oxidative stress, metabolic disturbance, and environmental toxins through necrotic or apoptotic cell death, while increased expression and phosphorylation of heat shock proteins such as Hsp27 can protect cells against cellular stress. Heat shock proteins commonly exhibit molecular chaperone activity and also interact with a wide variety of proteins to exert specific effects. The small heat shock protein Hsp27 exists as monomers, dimers, and oligomers in the cell, and each form has distinct activities. Oligomers are the main form of Hsp27 with molecular chaperone activity and are disrupted by phosphorylation of Hsp27 to form dimers and monomers. S-thiolation of Hsp27 on cysteine also dissociates oligomers and may provide another route of regulating the action of Hsp27 in stress. Map kinase cascades mediate Hsp27 phosphorylation. Heat stress activates the p38 kinase cascade and induces phosphorylation of Hsp27 by the downstream Map kinases Mapkapk2 and Mapkap3. Cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 can also induce Hsp27 phoshorylation through this Map kinase cascade, protecting",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a crucial role in development of diverse animal phyla, from Drosophila to humans, regulating morphogenesis of a variety of tissues and organs. Hh signaling is also involved in control of stem cell proliferation in adult tissues and aberrant activation of the Hh pathway has been linked to multiple types of human cancer. Members of the Hh family bind to patched (ptc), thus releasing smoothened (smo) to transduce a signal. Transcriptional activation occurs through the GLI family of proteins resulting in activation of target genes.",
  "The Fc Epsilon Receptor 1 signaling pathway in mast cells uses multiple core signal path to achieve its necessary ends. Through the BTK protein and PKC Mast cells are able to degranulate, through the PKC and MAPK paths the cells are able to alter cytokine expression and arachidonic acid release.",

  "As with many cell-surface receptors, activation of the EGF receptor can result in receptor internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis, desensitizing further receptor signaling. This process requires clathrin and occurs in clathrin-coated pits, which pinch off from the plasma membrane to form vesicles that move to the early endosome. From the early endosome, receptors can either be recycled back to the cell surface, or they can move through the late endosome to the lysosome for proteolytic degradation. The sorting of receptors in the early endosome for degradation requires the tyrosine kinase activity of activated growth factor receptor, and involves ubiquitination of the receptor. Targeting of receptors for degradation requires members of the Cbl gene family. Cbl proteins bind to tyrosine phosphorylated EGF receptor, and are E3 ubiquitination ligases that label receptor for degradation. Cbl also recruits Cin85 to the receptor complex, and blocking Cin85 interaction blocks receptor internalization and degradation. Endophilins are also a member of this receptor-bound protein complex. In its role as a ubiquitin ligase and docking protein, Cbl desensitizes EGF signaling and also opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF. EGF activation also appears to",
  "N-glycans or asparagine-linked glycans are major constituents of glycoproteins in eukaryotes. N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser / Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases, the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of human diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation.",
  "There is now much evidence that VEGFR-2 is the major mediator of VEGF-driven responses in endothelial cells and it is considered to be a crucial signal transducer in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to a cascade of different signaling pathways, resulting in the up-regulation of genes involved in mediating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and promoting their survival and vascular permeability. For example, the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to dimerization of the receptor, followed by intracellular activation of the PLCgamma; PKC-Raf kinase-MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth, whereas activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway leads to increased endothelial-cell survival. Activation of PI3K, FAK, and p38 MAPK is implicated in cell migration signaling.",
  "The phosphorylation of myosin affects its role in smooth muscle contraction, platelet formation and possibly other processes. Phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) increases myosin activity and dephosphorylation by myosin phosphatase decreases myosin activity. CPI, a factor that binds to and inhibits myosin phosphatase, is a target of phosphorylation by PKC and PKN. The inhibitory activity of CPI is regulated by its own phosphorylation state; when CPI is phosphorylated, its inhibitory activity is increased. The activation of signal transduction cascades such as GPCR pathways can lead to activation of PKC, phosphorylation of CPI, inhibition of myosin phosphatase, increased myosin phosphorylation and increased smooth muscle contraction or platelet release. The action of histamine in vasoconstriction, for example, may be mediated by activation of PKC through the histamine receptor, resulting in phosphorylation of CPI-17, increased inhibition of myosin phosphatase, and increased smooth muscle contraction.",
  "Growth hormone plays a major role in regulating growth during childhood and adolescence and also regulates metabolism. Defects in growth hormone signaling can result in dwarfism and decreases in growth hormone levels with age have been suggested to play a role in the reduced function of some physiological systems. Growth hormone signals a response in cells through the growth hormone receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Growth hormone causes the receptor to dimerize, activating the JAK2 protein kinase. The activity of JAK2 mediates many of the downstream responses to growth hormone through phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, MAP kinases, other kinase cascades and molecules involved in metabolism like IRS-1. Factors like SOCS and SHP-1 appear to play a role in the down regulation of signaling by growth hormone and cytokines.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) -1 / 2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1 / 2 / 3), p38 proteins (p38alpha / beta / gamma / delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1 / 2 for ERK1 / 2, MKK3 / 6 for the p38, MKK4 / 7 (JNKK1 / 2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1 / 2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1 / 2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.",
  "The glycolytic pathway begins with the simple sugar glucose and leads to pyruvate and eventually the Kreb's cycle. Dietary carbohydrates include a variety of sugars that are funneled into glycolysis to supply energy, including other monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides like starch. Fructose is an abundant monosaccharide in fruit, and is also found along with glucose in the common disaccharide sucrose. Fructose enters glycolysis by different pathways in the liver and muscle. In muscle, fructose is a substrate of hexokinase, like glucose, and enters the pathway directly as fructose 6-phosphate. In liver, hexokinase is present in very low levels and fructose passes through a more complex pathway. Fructose is first phosphorylated to form fructose 1-phosphate, which is then split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to enter glycolysis as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The sugar mannose also enters glycolysis at this point, first being converted to mannose 6-phosphate that is then isomerized to produce fructose 6-phosphate. Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk, and is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose only differs from glucose in its stereochemistry at one position, but",

  "Insulin resistance is strongly associated with type II diabetes. Diabetogenic factors including FFA, TNFalpha and cellular stress induce insulin resistance through inhibition of IRS1 functions. Serine / threonine phosphorylation, interaction with SOCS, regulation of the expression, modification of the cellular localization, and degradation represent the molecular mechanisms stimulated by them. Various kinases (ERK, JNK, IKKbeta, PKCzeta, PKCtheta and mTOR) are involved in this process. The development of type II diabetes requires impaired beta-cell function. Chronic hyperglycemia has been shown to induce multiple defects in beta-cells. Hyperglycemia has been proposed to lead to large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beta-cells, with subsequent damage to cellular components including PDX-1. Loss of PDX-1, a critical regulator of insulin promoter activity, has also been proposed as an important mechanism leading to beta-cell dysfunction. Although there is little doubt as to the importance of genetic factors in type II diabetes, genetic analysis is difficult due to complex interaction among multiple susceptibility genes and between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have therefore given very diverse results. Kir6.2",
  "One of the central features of mitotic cell division is the formation of the spindle that segregates chromosomes into each daughter cell. Chromosomes are not just passengers along for a ride with the spindle, but active participants in the nucleation and stabilization of spindle microtubules in their near vicinity. The ras-like GTPase Ran that regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) during interphase also regulates the formation of the mitotic spindle. Ran plays a similar role in each of these processes, regulating downstream signaling pathways in a differential manner based on whether GDP or GTP is bound. Like other GTPases, the inherent GTPase activity of Ran is regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and by exchange factors. An exchange factor that stimulates nucleotide exchange by the Ran GTPase is RCC1, which binds to chromatin in both interphase and mitosis. While RCC1 helps RAN drive transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm during interphase, the localization of RCC1 on chromatin during mitosis localizes Ran-GTP near chromosomes, localizing microtubule formation in these regions. Ran-BP1 and Ran-GAP1 stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Ran, converting it back to Ran-GDP further",
  "One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",
  "One of the major tasks of the renal proximal tubule (PT) is to secrete acid into the tubule lumen, thereby reabsorbing approximately 80% of the filtered bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)), as well as generating new HCO3 (-) for regulating blood pH. In the tubular lumen, filtered HCO3 (-) combines with H (+) in a reaction catalyzed by CA IV. The CO2 thus produced rapidly diffuses into the tubular cells and is combined with water to produce intracellular H (+) and HCO3 (-), catalyzed by soluble cytoplasmic CA II. HCO3 (-) is then cotransported with Na (+) into blood via the NBC-1. The intracellular H (+) produced by CA II is secreted into the tubular lumen predominantly via the NHE-3. The PT creates the new HCO3 (-) by taking glutamine and metabolizing it to two molecules each of NH4 (+) and HCO3 (-). The NH4 (+) is excreted into the tubular lumen, and the HCO3 (-), which is new HCO3 (-), is returned to the blood",
  "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals primarily through the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). The activities of IL-1 include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and roles in arthritis and septic shock. The inflammatory activities of IL-1 are partially derived by transcriptionally inducing expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interferons, as well as inducing the expression of other inflammation-related genes. There are two forms of IL-1 encoded by distinct genes, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta is produced as a 269 amino acid precursor that is cleaved by IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) to the active IL-1 beta form that is secreted. IL-1 signaling is opposed by the naturally occurring peptide IL-1 receptor antagonist which is a therapeutic agent for the treatment of arthritis. The type 1 IL-1 receptor protein binds IL-1 beta but requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to transduce a signal. IL-1 binding",
  "Integrins are cell surface receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix and mediate intracellular signals in response to the extracellular matrix including cellular shape, mobility, and progression through the cell cycle. Integrins do not themselves possess a kinase domain or enzymatic activity but rely on association with other signaling molecules to transmit signals. Interactions between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton commonly take place at focal adhesions on the cell surface that contain localized concentrations of integrins, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal elements. Talin forms a direct interaction with the integrin cytoplasmic domain, and interacts with cytoskeletal elements (actin) and signaling factors. Paxillin and CAS also localize in focal adhesions and may serve as a scaffold for other integrin signaling components like FAK and src. Interaction of FAK, CAS and src may be required for integrin regulation of cell cycle progression. The CrkL adaptor protein may regulate downstream integrin signaling. Growth factor signaling pathways and the caveolin receptor exhibit important cross talk with integrin receptors in cellular responses like activation of map kinase, proliferation and motility.",
  "Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes. This figure represents the possible activation routes of different protein kinases involved in Cx43 and Cx36 phosphorylation.",
  "Cell adhesion molecules are (glyco) proteins expressed on the cell surface and play a critical role in a wide array of biologic processes that include hemostasis, the immune response, inflammation, embryogenesis, and development of neuronal tissue. There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. Membrane proteins that mediate immune cellcell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions are important for brain morphology and highly coordinated brain functions such as memory and learning. During early development of the nervous system, neurons elongate their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of cell-cell adhesions. Cell-cell adhesions also underpin axon-axon contacts and link neurons with supporting schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.",
  "Increased adipocyte volume and number are positively correlated with leptin production, and negatively correlated with production of adiponectin. Leptin is an important regulator of energy intake and metabolic rate primarily by acting at hypothalamic nuclei. Leptin exerts its anorectic effects by modulating the levels of neuropeptides such as NPY, AGRP, and alpha-MSH. This leptin action is through the JAK kinase, STAT3 phosphorylation, and nuclear transcriptional effect. Adiponectin lowers plasma glucose and FFAs. These effects are partly accounted for by adiponectin-induced AMPK activation, which in turn stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake. Furthermore, activation of AMPK by adiponectin suppresses endogenous glucose production, concomitantly with inhibition of PEPCK and G6Pase expression. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha has been implicated as a link between obesity and insulin resistance. TNFalpha interferes with early steps of insulin signaling. Several data have shown that TNFalpha inhibits IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation by promoting its serine phosphorylation. Among the serine / threonine kinases activated by TNFalpha, JNK, mTOR and IKK have been shown to be involved in this phosphorylation.",

  "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), also known as killer T cells, provide a cell-mediated response to specific foreign antigens associated with cells. CTLs only respond to foreign antigen when it is presented bound to the MHC-1 expressed on the surface of all cells. CTLs do not respond to soluble antigen, but induce apoptosis in viral-infected cells and in cancer cells. When the complex of antigen bound to MHC-1 is bound to antigen-specific T cell receptor, the cytotoxic T cell induces apoptosis in the target cell primarily by two pathways, one involving perforin-mediated apoptosis and the other involving Fas / Fas-ligand interaction. When CTLs are activated by recognition of specific antigen on a cell, they release perforin proteins that integrate into the membrane of the target cell and organize to form a membrane pore. This allows the protease granzyme to enter the cell and activate the apoptotic caspase proteolytic cascade, and also allows other molecules to cross the cell membrane and trigger osmotic lysis of the membrane. The interaction of T-cell Fas ligand with the Fas receptor in the target cell can also activate the caspase cascade and other pathways involved in",
  "Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite of macrophages that causes visceral, mucosal, and cutaneous diseases. The parasite is transmitted to humans by sandflies, where they survive and proliferate intracellularly by deactivating the macrophage. Successful infection of Leishmania is achieved by alteration of signaling events in the host cell, leading to enhanced production of the autoinhibitory molecules like TGF-beta and decreased induction of cytokines such as IL12 for protective immunity. Nitric oxide production is also inhibited. In addition, defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes silences subsequent T cell activation mediated by macrophages, resulting in abnormal immune responses.",

  "Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF / CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF / CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the Endo",
  "Terminal differentiation of cells is often accompanied by repression of cellular proliferation, suggesting that there is a mechanism by which these cellular functions are coordinated. Macrophage differentiation is one model system in which this occurs; as macrophages differentiate, they also stop proliferating. Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in cell cycle progression as well as many differentiation processes. Ras stimulates cell cycle progression in part through Ets transcription factors that bind to cell cycle regulatory genes to activate their expression. Ets transcription factors also help to induce early macrophage differentiation. The activation of Ras signaling by M-CSF activates transcription of genes involved in differentiation through the coordinate expression of both Ets factors and AP-1. Other genes involved in cell cycle regulation involved the coordinate action of E2F-1 and Ets transcription factors. Mets is a factor related in sequence to Ets2 that is upregulated during macrophage differentiation. Increased expression of the Mets protein during macrophage differentiation allows the creation of heterodimers with DP103 to act as transcriptional repressors of cell cycle progression genes, recruiting corepressor to promoters they interact with. DP103 is a gene previously identified as an RNA helicase involved in RNA",
  "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has affected thousands of individuals, causing fever, and pneumonia with a mortality rate estimated at 10-18%. A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause agent and its genome has been sequenced. Human coronaviruses cause mild respiratory illness and accounts for about a third of all cases of the common cold. The enveloped SARS virus contains a large + strand RNA genome, approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Examination of the SARS coronavirus sequences reveals that rep gene covers over 20,000 nucleotides and encodes two overlapping polyproteins cleaved by viral proteases into smaller protein products. Translation of the longer polyprotein encoded by the rep gene requires a ribosomal frameshift. Other viral genes are predicted to encode the transmembrane spike protein S involved in viral fusion with host cells, the envelope protein E, the membrane protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N that binds to the RNA genome as well as several additional open reading frames with unknown functions. Viral entry into the cell is followed by translation of the viral rep gene, which codes for a viral protease within the polyprotein, Mpro or 3CL",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is most commonly known as the cytokine secreted by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production and is used as a drug for the treatment of anemias. Epo is also secreted in the brain in response to hypoxia, such as ischemic stroke. Epo production in the brain is stimulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Administration of Epo to the brain in rodents before hypoxic stress or other neuronal stresses is neuroprotective, preventing neuronal apoptosis. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is known to associate with JAK kinases that phosphorylate and activate the STAT family of transcription factors. The neuroprotection by Epo involves cross-talk between Epo receptor and anti-apoptotic pathways through activation of NF-kB by the JAK2 kinase. Epo stimulates JAK2 phosphorylation of I-kB, releasing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of neuroprotective genes. Neuroprotective genes activated by NF-kB include the anti-oxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase and calbindin-D (28k). The erythropoietin receptor is also essential for proper brain development in mice. The absence of EpoR causes high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the developing",
  "Activation of the protease-activated GPCRs in platelets contributes to platelet activation in clotting. The protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved by the protease thrombin, releasing a tethered peptide ligand that activates the receptor and triggers intracellular calcium release. Platelets from mice lacking the PAR4 gene are not activated by thrombin and are impaired in clotting, supporting the importance of thrombin signaling through PAR4 in clotting. Human platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4, with PAR1 playing a more dominant role in clotting in humans. Calcium release induced by PARs activates PKC, modulating integrin alpha IIB beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb / IIIa) and opening integrin ligand binding sites to contribute to platelet aggregation. Intracellular calcium increases induced by thrombin activates phospholipase A2, liberating arachidonic acid, the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis. Ras / Map kinase activation by the PAR receptors also activates phospholipase A2. The activation of PAR-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by aspirin, indicating that thromboxane production induced by PAR signaling contributes to platelet activation. Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin PGG2 by the enzyme Cox-1 in platelets, and Cox-1 is",

  "Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes. This figure represents the possible activation routes of different protein kinases involved in Cx43 and Cx36 phosphorylation.",
  "The chromatin packaging of the genome is dynamic, changing with the cell cycle and with transcriptional regulation. During mitosis, chromatin is condensed for segregation of chromosomes, while for transcription chromatin is more open. The nuclear matrix, or scaffold, is a protein network in the nucleus providing structure and regulating chromatin condensation. Regulated interactions of matrix proteins with each other, DNA and other factors in different phases of the cell cycle alter the structure and function of chromatin. AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein) is a nuclear matrix associated protein that also binds DNA and different proteins during different phases of the cell cycle. The interaction of AKAP95 with DNA and proteins alters the condensation and transcription of chromatin. A specific domain of AKAP95 regulates its interaction with the nuclear matrix and another regulates its association with DNA. One key protein that AKAP95 interacts with is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. AKAP95 binds to PKA through a PKA RII regulatory subunit, an interaction that requires PKA phosphorylation by Cdk1. PKA activity and cAMP are reduced during entry into mitosis, but PKA recruited by AKAP",

  "Growth hormone plays a major role in regulating growth during childhood and adolescence and also regulates metabolism. Defects in growth hormone signaling can result in dwarfism and decreases in growth hormone levels with age have been suggested to play a role in the reduced function of some physiological systems. Growth hormone signals a response in cells through the growth hormone receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Growth hormone causes the receptor to dimerize, activating the JAK2 protein kinase. The activity of JAK2 mediates many of the downstream responses to growth hormone through phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, MAP kinases, other kinase cascades and molecules involved in metabolism like IRS-1. Factors like SOCS and SHP-1 appear to play a role in the down regulation of signaling by growth hormone and cytokines.",
  "Endocytosis is a mechanism for cells to remove ligands, nutrients, and plasma membrane (PM) proteins, and lipids from the cell surface, bringing them into the cell interior. Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type.",
  "Activation of the MAPK kinase pathway has been identified as a mechanism that integrins use to regulate gene expression leading to cell shape changes during cell spreading or migration Epithelial cells respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cause integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates the surrounding proteins (paxillin, Fyn / shc, and src) and leads to signal amplification. FAK also binds PI-3 kinase and is upstream of the MAP kinase pathway. When MAPkinase or PI-3 kinase was inhibited, actin reorganization was blocked. Src phosphorylates p190RhoGAP, inactivating its GAP function that may allow RhoGTP to stay active longer, promoting further signal amplification. Activated RhoGTP binds to downstream kinases such as Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (p160ROCK) and p140 diaphanous (p140Dia) to increase actin polymerization and contraction. Actin reorganization assists integrin clustering, allowing more ECM binding that increase FAK phosphorylation and other signal transduction events.",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM (familial DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of familial DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an idiopathic DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of idiopathic DCM focus on chronic viral myocarditis and / or on autoimmune abnormalities. Viral myocarditis may progress to an autoimmune phase and then to progressive cardiac dilatation. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with idiopathic DCM, may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2 +, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.",
  "The ever evolving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways consist of four major groupings and numerous related proteins which constitute interrelated signal transduction cascades activated by stimuli such as growth factors, stress, cytokines and inflammation. The four major groupings are the Erk (red), JNK or SAPK (blue), p38 (green) and the Big MAPK or ERK5 (light blue) cascades. Signals from cell surface receptors such as GPCRs and growth factor receptors are transduced, directly or via small G proteins such as ras and rac, to multiple tiers of protein kinases that amplify these signals and / or regulate each other. The diagram is organized to illustrate the cascades by the background colors and also the tiers of kinases as indicated down the left hand side and separated by the horizontal dashed lines. In some cascades the first activation tier involves the MAPKKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases or MAP4K proteins. The next tier are the serine / threonine MAPKKKs, MAP kinase kinase kinase or MAP3Ks such as RAF, TAK, ASK, and MEKK1. This level has the greatest amount of cross-communication cu",
  "Two major types of genetic events are crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML): activating mutations of signal transduction intermediates and alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation. Both aberrant and constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules are found in about 50% of primary AML bone marrow samples, and seem to contribute to the increased proliferation and apoptosis resistance. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Specific haematopoietic transcription factors are crucial for differentiation to particular lineages during normal differentiation, but are frequently disrupted in AML. Some mechanisms of disruption involve the effect of fusion proteins that are generated by chromosomal translocations on haematopoietic transcription factors. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",
  "Map kinases transduce responses to extracellular signals by a variety of routes, and communicate with other pathways through extensive crosstalk networks. A closely studied Map kinase cascade originates with tyrosine kinase activation, and activation of Ras. Ras activates Raf, Raf activates the Map kinase kinases Mek1 and Mek2 and these kinases activate downstream Map kinases like Erk1 and Erk2. Erk1 and Erk2 in turn activate transgenes like p35 through the Map kinase activated transcription factor EGR-1. Mek1 plays a central role in many different Map kinase pathways. Factors that activate Mek1 include growth factors like NGF, cytokines, chemokines, and phorbol ester, resulting in cellular proliferation and survival. Mek1 activation may also play a role in differentiation in neuronal tissues. In cultured neuronal PC-12 cells, NGF induces neurite outgrowth via Mek1 and the map kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of Mek1 can transform cells and may play a role in cancer. The crucial role of Mek1 in a variety of pathways including cellular transformation suggests that the cell must tightly regulate its activity. Cdk5 is a kinase that regulates the activity of Mek1. Although Cdk5",
  "Her2 or ERBB2 belongs to a class of proteins having high homology with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ERBB1). It encodes a protein with the molecular weight of 185 KDa. Unlike other members of EGFR family, no ligand for Her2 has been found and it usually associates with members of ERBB1 family to form functional heterodimers. It has been shown that it can form dimers with ERBB (EGFR), ERBB3 and ERBB4 as well as gp130 subunits of IL-6 receptor. In at least some cell types, the association between gp130 and HRBB2 is essential for HRBB2-ERBB3 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP kinase signaling. Although ERBB1 can form homodimers, the signaling for ERBB1 is usually transient and the receptor undergoes internalization after ligand binding and activation. EGFR-HER2 complex increases the signaling capacity of EGFR by increasing the ligand affinity as well as the recycling of the heterodimer. Of all the ERBB heterodimers, ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimers perhaps elicit the strongest signal. Removing ERBB3 from the cell has a drastic effect on ERBB2 mediated signaling and downstream effectors.

  "The defects in cAMP-regulated chloride channel CTFR are believed to be the major cause for cystic fibrosis. Regulation of CFTR protein by the surface receptor beta adrenergic receptor is mediated through the ezrin / radixin / moesin binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), which binds both the C-termini CFTR and b2AR through their PDZ binding motifs. In the resting state, CFTR, b2AR, and EBP50 exist as a macromolecular complex on the apical surface of epithelial cells. Upon agonist activation of the b2AR, the adenulate cyclase is stimulated through the G protein pathway, leading to an increase in cAMP. The elevated concentration of cAMP activates PKA, which is anchored near CFTR via interaction with Ezrin. The phosphorylation of CFTR by PKA disrupts the complex and leads to compartmentalized and specific signaling of the channel.",
  "PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene. Recombinant PTEN is capable of dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, the product of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. Many of the cancer-related mutations have been mapped to the phosphatase catalytic domain, it has been suggested that the phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for its tumor suppressor function. The activation of PKB / AKT is regulated in a complex manner via phosphorylation of AKT on Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and ILK (integrin-linked kinase) respectively. Inactivation of PTEN will constitutively activate PKB / AKT pathway. In addition to its role in regulating the PI 3-K / AKT cell survival pathway, PTEN also inhibits growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation and suppresses the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. PTEN also interact with FAK, a key molecule implicated in integrin signaling pathways, and it directly dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK. PTEN down-regulation of p130CAS through FAK results in inhibition of cell migration and spreading.",
  "Integrins are cell surface receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix and mediate intracellular signals in response to the extracellular matrix including cellular shape, mobility, and progression through the cell cycle. Integrins do not themselves possess a kinase domain or enzymatic activity but rely on association with other signaling molecules to transmit signals. Interactions between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton commonly take place at focal adhesions on the cell surface that contain localized concentrations of integrins, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal elements. Talin forms a direct interaction with the integrin cytoplasmic domain, and interacts with cytoskeletal elements (actin) and signaling factors. Paxillin and CAS also localize in focal adhesions and may serve as a scaffold for other integrin signaling components like FAK and src. Interaction of FAK, CAS and src may be required for integrin regulation of cell cycle progression. The CrkL adaptor protein may regulate downstream integrin signaling. Growth factor signaling pathways and the caveolin receptor exhibit important cross talk with integrin receptors in cellular responses like activation of map kinase, proliferation and motility.",
  "A demonstrated means to increase lifespan in a wide range of organisms is through the restriction of caloric intake. Reducing the consumption of calories increases the lifespan of many different organisms, including mice. Although caloric restriction has not been demonstrated experimentally to increase human lifespan, short-term changes in physiological measures like insulin responsiveness have been observed. Caloric restriction not only increases lifespan, but decreases age-related deterioration of systems and physiological responses, reducing age related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric",
  "The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Normally, ligand-dependent signaling by Hedgehog (Hh) homologs proceeds through binding to the Patched receptor. This binding relieves the Patched-mediated inhibition of signaling through the Smoothened (SMOH) gene product. This signaling ultimately results in the dissociation of the Gli1 transcription factor from an inhibitory complex in the cytoplasm, its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, and activation of target gene expression. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (> 50%) in sporadic BCC.",
  "N-glycans or asparagine-linked glycans are major constituents of glycoproteins in eukaryotes. N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser / Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases, the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of human diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that stimulates neuronal survival and growth through TrkA, a member of the trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors that also includes TrkB and TrkC. Some NGF responses are also mediated or modified by p75LNTR, a low affinity neurotrophin receptor. Binding of NGF to TrkA stimulates neuronal survival, and also proliferation. Pathways coupled to these responses are linked to TrkA through association of signaling factors with specific amino acids in the TrkA cytoplasmic domain. Cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis is signaled through activation of PI3-kinase and AKT. Ras-mediated signaling and phospholipase C both activate the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate proliferation.",
  "The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of three sites (ser 112,136 and 155). Phosphorylation at these sites results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. While ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with the activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. BAD Ser 155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors.",
  "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals primarily through the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). The activities of IL-1 include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and roles in arthritis and septic shock. The inflammatory activities of IL-1 are partially derived by transcriptionally inducing expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interferons, as well as inducing the expression of other inflammation-related genes. There are two forms of IL-1 encoded by distinct genes, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta is produced as a 269 amino acid precursor that is cleaved by IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) to the active IL-1 beta form that is secreted. IL-1 signaling is opposed by the naturally occurring peptide IL-1 receptor antagonist which is a therapeutic agent for the treatment of arthritis. The type 1 IL-1 receptor protein binds IL-1 beta but requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to transduce a signal. IL-1 binding",
  "The p44 / 42 MAP Kinase pathway consists of a protein kinase cascade linking growth and differentiation signals with transcription in the nucleus. Growth factor receptors and tyrosine kinases activate Ras which in turn activates c-Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. Activated p44 / 42 MAP Kinase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription by phosphorylation of kinases such as p90 RSK, MSK, and transcription factors such as ELK-1 and Stat3. The importance of this pathway in both growth control and development has been demonstrated via the transforming properties of various mutant forms of Ras, Raf, MEK and by their effects on development. Signal amplification and the potential for crosstalk appear to be important features of this regulatory network.",
  "The vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is a highly specialized cell whose principal function is contraction. On contraction, VSMCs shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure. The principal mechanisms that regulate the contractile state of VSMCs are changes in cytosolic Ca2 + concentration (c). In response to vasoconstrictor stimuli, Ca2 + is mobilized from intracellular stores and / or the extracellular space to increase c in VSMCs. The increase in c, in turn, activates the Ca2 + -CaM-MLCK pathway and stimulates MLC20 phosphorylation, leading to myosin-actin interactions and, hence, the development of contractile force. The sensitivity of contractile myofilaments or MLC20 phosphorylation to Ca2 + can be secondarily modulated by other signaling pathways. During receptor stimulation, the contractile force is greatly enhanced by the inhibition of myosin phosphatase. Rho / Rho kinase, PKC, and arachidonic acid have been proposed to play a pivotal role in this enhancement. The signaling events that mediate relaxation include the removal of a contractile agonist (passive relaxation) and activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in the continued presence of a",

  "The binding of -arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs coincides with the recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases, including c-Src, Hck and c-Fgr (Src-TK), to the receptor-arrestin complex. Several signaling events have been reported to involve -arrestin-dependent Src recruitment. These include the regulation of clathrin-dependent 2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis by tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin, Ras-dependent activation of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinase cascade and stimulation of cell proliferation by 2-adrenergic and neurokinin NK1 receptors, and stimulation of chemokine CXCR1 receptor-mediated neutrophil degranulation",
  "Apoptosis is specifically induced via signaling through a family of receptors known collectively as' death receptors' including Fas, TNFR, DR3, -4 and -5. Death receptor ligands characteristically initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascades. Apo3L recruits initiator caspase 8 via the adapter protein FADD. Caspase 8 then oligomerizes and is activated via autocatalysis. Activated caspase 8 stimulates apoptosis via two parallel cascades: it directly cleaves and activates caspase-3, and it cleaves Bid (a Bcl-2 family protein). Truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria, inducing cytochrome C release, which sequentially activates caspases 9 and 3. DR-3L can deliver pro- or anti-apoptotic signals. DR-3 promote apoptosis via the adaptor proteins TRADD / FADD and the activation of caspase 8. Alternatively, apoptosis inhibited via an adaptor protein complex including RIP which activates NF-kB and induces survival genes including IAP. Induction of apoptosis via Apo2L requires caspase activity, but the adaptor requirement is unclear.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clot. The kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. Complement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.",

  "Progesterone (Pg) binds to both intracellular iPR and plasma membrane- bound mPR. (Right Top) After binding to Pg, iPR is recruited to the membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase p60c- src, which induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in activation of p90Rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Myt1, which favors formation of the activated cell cycle complex cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 causes breakdown of the germinal vesicle and the initiation of oocyte maturation. (Left). In contrast, binding of Pg to mPR leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through activation of Gi or inhibition of Gs. This leads to a decrease in the cAMPdependent kinase PKA, which relieves inhibition of Cdc25C (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cyclin B-Cdc2) and also indirectly promotes the activation of MAPK signaling. PKA also regulates the initiation of oocyte maturation through other effects that are independent of PKA activity.",
  "The classification of autoimmune throid disease (AITD) includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and its variants, Graves' disease (GD) and autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis or primary myxedema. HT is characterized by the presence of goitre, thyroid autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in serum and varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. During HT, self-reactive CD4 + T lymphocytes (Th) recruit B cells and CD8 + T cells (CTL) into the thyroid. Disease progression leads to the death of thyroid cells and hypothyroidism. Both autoantibodies and thyroid-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been proposed to be responsible for autoimmune thyrocyte depletion. In GD, the TSH-R is the most important autoantigen. Antibodies directed against it mimic the effects of the hormone on thyroid cells, TSH, stimulating autonomous production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine and causing hyperthyroidism. The presence of TSH-R-blocking antibodies that bind the TSH receptor in a similar fashion to the antibodies in patients with Graves' disease but that block rather than activate the receptor explains some cases of atrophic hypothyroidism.",
  "Interactions between cells responsible for cell to cell adhesion also can communicate signals into the cellular interior, often involving interactions with cytoskeletal elements to produce changes in cell motility, migration, proliferation and shape. The cadherins are cell surface adhesion molecules that help form tight junctions between cells such as formation of epithelial cell layers. E-cadherin inactivation has been implicated in cancer development. In addition to mediating adhesion with other cells, cadherins transduce signals into cells through interactions with the catenins. Catenins probably affect actin cytoskeletal function through interactions with proteins like actinin and vinculin. Catenins also probably trigger changes in cell shape and motility with signals through the Rho small GTPases. Another important cell adhesion molecule is CD-31, or PECAM-1, involved in the formation of junctions between endothelial cells, cell migration, migration of lymphocytes, and regulation of lymphocyte activation. Src phosphorylates PECAM-1 on tyrosine residues causing SHP-2 association with PECAM-1. Paxillin acts as an adaptor protein between proteins involved in adhesion signaling like FAK and src and cytoskeletal elements. In addition to signals created by adhesion molecules to alter cellular responses, other signaling",
  "Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2 / neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) show elevated expression of EGF receptors (e.g. HER2 / neu) and their ligands (e.g.TGF-alpha) consistent with the presence of this autocrine loop. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.",
  "Apoptotic cell death can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways including caspases and mitochondria. A cellular response that is characteristic of apoptosis is fragmentation of the nuclear genome to create a nucleosomal ladder. This activity is conducted by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic signaling pathways. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase-activated DNAse (CAD). DFF / CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF / CAD interacts with chromatin components such as topo II and histone H1 to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G, EndoG. EndoG is encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in apoptotic signaling in other ways as well, through the release of cytochrome c induced by Bid to activate the caspase protease cascade. These pathways are independent since the Endo",
  "The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway is one of a handful of pleiotropic cascades used to transduce a multitude of signals for development and homeostasis in animals, from humans to flies. In mammals, the JAK / STAT pathway is the principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, STATs are activated by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. In addition to the activation of STATs, JAKs mediate the recruitment of other molecules such as the MAP kinases, PI3 kinase etc. These molecules process downstream signals via the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways which results in the activation of additional transcription factors.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, which include TGF-betas, activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are structurally related secreted cytokines found in species ranging from worms and insects to mammals. A wide spectrum of cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration are regulated by TGF-beta family members. TGF-beta family member binds to the Type II receptor and recruits Type I, whereby Type II receptor phosphorylates and activates Type I. The Type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads: Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8). Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and the heteromeric complex then translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Smad complexes activate specific genes through cooperative interactions with other DNA-binding and coactivator (or co-repressor) proteins.",

Caloric restriction in animals reduces the levels of plasma glucose and insulin and reduces inflammatory responses and may reduce oxidative stress through reduced oxidative metabolism, further contributing to the health benefits of reduced calorie intake. The reduction in inflammation may be related to reduces plasma glucose and in humans could reduce an inflammation connection to cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Genetic analysis has indicated several genes that influence lifespan, particularly those that alter pituitary development, reduce growth hormone secretion, reduce food intake, and reduce apoptosis (p66 Shc). All of these appear to converge on an IGF-1 receptor pathway and to reproduce many of the effects of caloric",
  "There is now much evidence that VEGFR-2 is the major mediator of VEGF-driven responses in endothelial cells and it is considered to be a crucial signal transducer in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to a cascade of different signaling pathways, resulting in the up-regulation of genes involved in mediating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and promoting their survival and vascular permeability. For example, the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to dimerization of the receptor, followed by intracellular activation of the PLCgamma; PKC-Raf kinase-MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth, whereas activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway leads to increased endothelial-cell survival. Activation of PI3K, FAK, and p38 MAPK is implicated in cell migration signaling.",
  "Interaction of T cell receptor with specific antigen in the context of MHC II activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to T cell activation. In the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the src family kinases Lck and Fyn are activated to phosphorylate proteins in the T cell receptor complex which recruit and activate the ZAP70 kinase. The activation of ZAP70 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate MAP kinase pathways and cause T cell activation. The CD45 phosphorylase also plays a role in T cell receptor signaling, dephosphorylated Lck and Fyn to activate them. Other factors modulate T cell receptor activation. Csk (COOH-terminal Srk kinase) phosphorylates Lck and deactivates it, opposing the action of CD45. The phosphorylation of Lck by Csk inhibits T cell receptor signaling and inhibits T cell activation. Csk activity is regulated in T cells by PKA, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated by the second messenger cAMP. The activity of Csk also appears to depend on other factors such as CBP, which recruits Csk to the plasma membrane in lipid rafts where other signaling factors such the T cell receptor complex are localized. CBP also directly activates Csk.",
  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin. There are 4 major histologic subtypes of RCC: conventional (clear cell RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Multiple genes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for hereditary (von Hippel-Lindau) and sporadic variants of conventional (clear cell) RCC. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. An oncogene, MET has been found to be mutant in cases of hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), although the incidence of c-MET mutations is low in sporadic papillary RCC. Once activated, MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome (HLRCC",
  "One of the central features of mitotic cell division is the formation of the spindle that segregates chromosomes into each daughter cell. Chromosomes are not just passengers along for a ride with the spindle, but active participants in the nucleation and stabilization of spindle microtubules in their near vicinity. The ras-like GTPase Ran that regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) during interphase also regulates the formation of the mitotic spindle. Ran plays a similar role in each of these processes, regulating downstream signaling pathways in a differential manner based on whether GDP or GTP is bound. Like other GTPases, the inherent GTPase activity of Ran is regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and by exchange factors. An exchange factor that stimulates nucleotide exchange by the Ran GTPase is RCC1, which binds to chromatin in both interphase and mitosis. While RCC1 helps RAN drive transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm during interphase, the localization of RCC1 on chromatin during mitosis localizes Ran-GTP near chromosomes, localizing microtubule formation in these regions. Ran-BP1 and Ran-GAP1 stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Ran, converting it back to Ran-GDP further",
  "Wnt family members are secreted glycoproteins who bind to cell surface receptors such as Frizzled. Wnt members can play a role in the expression of many genes by interacting with multiple disparate signaling pathways. Shown is the Wnt / beta-catenin pathway.",
  "The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway is one of a handful of pleiotropic cascades used to transduce a multitude of signals for development and homeostasis in animals, from humans to flies. In mammals, the JAK / STAT pathway is the principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, STATs are activated by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. In addition to the activation of STATs, JAKs mediate the recruitment of other molecules such as the MAP kinases, PI3 kinase etc. These molecules process downstream signals via the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways which results in the activation of additional transcription factors.",
  "Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a biphasic disease, initiated by expression of the BCR / ABL fusion gene product in self-renewing, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs can differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), which then differentiate into granulocyte / macrophage progenitors (GMPs). HSCs can also differentiate into common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which are the progenitors of lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells. The initial chronic phase of CML (CML-CP) is characterized by a massive expansion of the granulocytic-cell series. Acquisition of additional genetic mutations beyond expression of BCR / ABL causes the progression of CML from chronic phase to blast phase (CML-BP), characterized by an accumulation of myeloid or lymphoid blast cells. The BCR / ABL fusion gene encodes p210BCR / ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The tyrosine kinase activity is essential for cell transformation and the cytoplasmic localization of BCR / ABL allows the assembly of phosphorylated substrates in multiprotein complexes that transmit",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting various pathogens and generating innate immune responses. The intracellular NOD-like receptor (NLR) family contains more than 20 members in mammals and plays a pivotal role in the recognition of intracellular ligands. NOD1 and NOD2, two prototypic NLRs, sense the cytosolic presence of the bacterial peptidoglycan fragments that escaped from endosomal compartments, driving the activation of NF- {kappa} B and MAPK, cytokine production and apoptosis. On the other hand, a different set of NLRs induces caspase-1 activation through the assembly of multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. These NLRs include NALP1, NALP3 and Ipaf. The inflammasomes are critical for generating mature proinflammatory cytokines in concert with Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.",

Activation of PI3K, FAK, and p38 MAPK is implicated in cell migration signaling.",
  "Ca2 + that enters the cell from the outside is a principal source of signal Ca2 +. Entry of Ca2 + is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2 + by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2 + fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2 + -entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs). The other principal source of Ca2 + for signalling is the internal stores that are located primarily in the endoplasmic / sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER / SR), in which inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RYRs) regulate the release of Ca2 +. The principal activator of these channels is Ca2 + itself and this process",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to infection by the immune system that requires communication between different classes of immune cells to coordinate their actions. Acute inflammation is an important part of the immune response, but chronic inappropriate inflammation can lead to destruction of tissues in autoimmune disorders and perhaps neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disease. Secreted cytokine proteins provide signals between immune cells to coordinate the inflammatory response. Some cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF act to broadly provoke the inflammatory response while others act on specific types of immune cells. Macrophages and other phagocytotic cells provide a front-line defense against bacterial infection. Macrophages stimulate the inflammatory responses of neutrophils, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in response infection by secreting IL-1 and TNF. IL-1 and TNF cause fever through alteration of the body temperature set-point in the hypothalamus. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to IL-1 and TNF by recruiting more immune cells to the site of inflammation. Secreted IL-8 is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils to sites of infection. Macrophages also present antigen to T helper cells that play a central role in coordinating immune responses. T helper cells induce clonal",
  "Interleukin-3 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells through binding to its receptor. The receptor for IL-3 is a heterodimer with a ligand-specific alpha chain (70 kD, CD123) and a common beta chain (shared with IL-5 and GM-CSF). Signaling is believed to be primarily through Stat5 and the MAPK pathways.",
  "The cell cycle is regulated by the interplay of many molecules. Key among these are the cyclins which are expressed and then degraded in a concerted fashion to drive the stages of the cell cycle. Cyclins combine with cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) to form activated kinases that phosphorylate targets leading to cell cycle regulation. A breakdown in the regulation of this cycle can lead to out of control growth and contribute to tumor formation. Defects in many of the molecules that regulate the cell cycle have been implicated in cancer. Key among these are p53, the cdk inhibitors (p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27), and Rb, all of which act to keep the cell cycle from progressing until all repairs to damaged DNA have been completed.",
  "T cell activation is initiated by recognition of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) in the context of Class II MHC on an antigen-presenting cell. The T cell receptor contains multiple subunits and interacts with several factors to transduce antigen-stimulated T cell activation. One of the key steps that initiates receptor activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR subunits by the src family protein kinases Lck and Fyn. T cell receptor phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn recruits the ZAP-70 protein kinase to the receptor complex, which becomes activated and stimulates downstream pathways like the Map kinase cascade. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase activates Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating these proteins and is required for TCR activation. Association of the CD4 coreceptor with Lck may also be involved in Lck activation.",
  "TACI and BCMA signal transduction pathway that enhances cell survival APRIL and BAFF (also called TALL-I and BLyS) are TNF family members that act as ligands for the BCMA and TACI receptors. Both APRIL and BAFF bind to both the BCMA and TACI receptors to activate the humoral immune response, stimulating B cell immunoglobulin production and proliferation. BAFF is found as a membrane bound form in T cells and a soluble form that is released from the cell to stimulate B cell proliferation and differentiation. As members of the TNF receptor gene family, BCMA and TACI interact with TRAF family members to transduce signals downstream to NF-kappaB activation and MAP kinase pathways. Abnormally active BAFF or APRIL signaling may play a role in autoimmune disorders such as lupus.",
  "TNF acts on several different signaling pathways through two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 to regulate apoptotic pathways, NF-kB activation of inflammation, and activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Interaction of TNFR1 with TRADD leads to activation of NF-kB and apoptosis pathways, while interaction with TRAF2 has generally been thought to be involved in stress kinase and NF-kB activation but is not required for TNF to induce apoptosis. Activation of NF-kB is mediated by TRAF2 through the NIK kinase and also by RIP but the observation that TNF activates NF-kB in mice lacking TRAF2 indicates that TRAF-2 does not play an essential role in this process. Stress-activated protein kinases, also called JNKs, are a family of map kinases activated by cellular stress and inflammatory signals. Binding of TNF to the TNFR1 receptor activates the germinal center kinase (GCK) through the TNF adaptor Traf2, activating the map kinase MEKK1. Both GCK and MEKK1 interact with Traf2, and GCK is required for MEKK1 activation by TNF, but GCK kinase activity does not appear to be required for MEKK1 activation. Instead, GCK activates",
  "TNFR1 (a.k.a. p55, CD120a) is the receptor for TNF (alpha) and also will bind TNF (beta). Upon binding TNF (alpha) a TNFR1 + cell is triggered to undergo apoptosis. This critical regulatory process is accomplished by activating the proteolytic caspase cascade that results in the degradation of many critical cellular proteins.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a) is a tissue-specific coactivator that enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors and coordinates transcriptional programs important for energy metabolism and energy homeostasis. Inappropriate increases in PGC-1a activity have been linked to a number of pathological conditions including heart failure and diabetes. PGC-1a is highly expressed in metabolically active tissues including brown fat, skeletal muscle and heart. PGC-1a has been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart and increased mitochondrial respiration in brown fat. PGC-1a is a coactivator for many factors including, CBP, Scr-1, PPARa, GR (glucocorticoid receptor), THR (thyroid hormone receptor), several orphan receptors and MEF2. This pathway illustrates two of the cofactor regulatory factors MEF2 and PPARa) and an example orphan receptor feedback inhibition loop. Glut4 is used as an example of the downstream elements leading to changes in metabolism. Ichida et al discovered the ERRa repression of PGC-1a. Their results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional control wherein ERR-a can function as a specific molecular repressor of PGC-",
  "IL-22 is an inflammatory cytokine related to IL-10 that is produced by T cells and that induces a response in cells through a heterodimeric cell surface receptor composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2C. One of the actions of IL-22 appears to be the induction of the acute phase inflammatory response in hetapocytes, acting through activation of STATs and transcriptional regulation. A gene with homology to the extracellular domain of the cell surface IL-22R1 receptor component was identified that lacked transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The protein derived from this gene was found to bind IL-22 and block its interaction with the cell surface receptor. The IL-22 soluble receptor (IL-22BP, IL-22 binding protein) also blocks some of the downstream effects of IL-22 such as STAT activation and the transcriptional induction of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. The IL-22 soluble receptor may act as an anti-inflammatory agent.",
  "Contraction of the heart is a complex process initiated by the electrical excitation of cardiac myocytes (excitation-contraction coupling, ECC). In cardiac myocytes, Ca2 + influx induced by activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (DHP receptors) upon membrane depolarization triggers the release of Ca2 + via Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through a Ca2 + -induced Ca release (CICR) mechanism. Ca2 + ions released via the CICR mechanism diffuse through the cytosolic space to contractile proteins to bind to troponinC resulting in the release of inhibition induced by troponinI. The Ca2 + binding to troponinC thereby triggers the sliding of thin and thick filaments, that is, the activation of a crossbridge and subsequent cardiac force development and / or cell shortening. Recovery occurs as Ca2 + is pumped out of the cell by the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) or is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by sarco (endo) plasmic Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) pumps on the non-junctional region of the SR.",
  "The differentiation of keratinocytes constantly replenishes the upper layers of human skin we lose each day. One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced",
  "Inflammation is a complex response involving many different cells and signaling molecules, including the secretion of the cytokine IL-17 by activated T cells. IL-17 secretion is restricted to specific subsets of T cells but the receptor for IL-17 is widely expressed throughout the body, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Inflammatory responses involving IL-17 probably contribute to arthritis, asthma, skin immune reactions and autoimmune disorders. Fibroblasts and other cells stimulated by IL-17 are induced themselves to secrete inflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). These cytokines in turn provoke a range of activities, including the stimulation of neutrophil proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The IL-2 receptor is a key component of immune signaling and is required for the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. This receptor is composed of three polypeptide chains, the alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2 receptor gamma chain is a common component for several other cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. The IL-2 receptor beta chain is essential for IL-2 signaling and is also a component of the IL-15 receptor complex. The polypeptides of the IL-2 receptor do not themselves have intrinsic catalytic activity, but interact with cytoplasmic signaling proteins to transduce signals. br > Different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor beta chain interact and couple with distinct signaling pathways and cellular responses. JAK1 associates with the beta chain, and JAK3 with the gamma chain. Binding of IL-2 induces heterodimerization of receptor subunits, and activation of JAK kinase activity. Tyrosine residues in the beta chain cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated during activation, recruiting other factors to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues through src homology 2 (SH2) domains",
  "The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of three sites (ser 112,136 and 155). Phosphorylation at these sites results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. While ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with the activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. BAD Ser 155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), a multi-functional kinase, and its neuron-specific activator p35 are required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Proteolytic cleavage of p35 produces p25, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conversion of p35 to p25 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5 and the hyperphosphorylates tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments and promotes apoptosis. In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress and calcium influx induce the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates, addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific inhibitors of calpain1, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In vitro, calpain1 directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative molecular mass 25,000. Application of the amyloid beta-peptide A beta induces the conversion of p35 to p25 in primary cortical neurons. Inhibition of cdk5 or calpain activity reduces cell death in A beta-treated cortical",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A) goes by the colloquial designation p16, which is sometimes referred to as p16 (INK4). The alpha transcript of CDKN2A has been shown to encode p16 (INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the RB protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A encodes p14 (ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14 (ARF) is shorter than the corresponding mouse protein, p19 (ARF), and the 2 proteins share only 50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53 response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A and MDM2, and resulting in a distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2 / M phases. Two unrelated proteins encoded by the INK4A-ARF locus function in tumor suppression. ARF binds to MDM2 and promotes the rapid degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the E1-beta-encoded N-terminal domain of",
  "The p44 / 42 MAP Kinase pathway consists of a protein kinase cascade linking growth and differentiation signals with transcription in the nucleus. Growth factor receptors and tyrosine kinases activate Ras which in turn activates c-Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. Activated p44 / 42 MAP Kinase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription by phosphorylation of kinases such as p90 RSK, MSK, and transcription factors such as ELK-1 and Stat3. The importance of this pathway in both growth control and development has been demonstrated via the transforming properties of various mutant forms of Ras, Raf, MEK and by their effects on development. Signal amplification and the potential for crosstalk appear to be important features of this regulatory network.",
  "The hepatocyte growth factor receptor, also called c-Met, is activated by HGF and stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes and other cell types. Mutated forms of the HGF receptor are associated with oncogenesis and metastasis, making the HGF receptor a potential therapeutic target for cancer drugs. Changes in cell motility, cell shape, adhesion, resistance to apoptosis, and anchorage independent growth all contribute to the role of c-Met in cancer. The HGF receptor is a heterodimer with tyrosine kinase activity and associates with a multiprotein complex involved in downstream signal transduction. The HGF receptor can associate with several different signaling systems, including src, Grb2 / SOS, PI3 kinase and Gab1. One of the major substrates of the activated HGF receptor tyrosine kinase is the adaptor protein Gab1. Gab1 interacts with Crk and CrkL, two proteins with SH2 and SH3 protein interaction domains that couple to signaling further downstream. The actions of HGF on paxillin, DOCK180 and Rap1 mediated through GAB1 and other members of this complex alter cell motility. Regulation of Rho, Rac1 and CDC42 pathways in response to HGF all contribute to changes in cellular motility. Another target of",

  "Neutrophils respond to bacterial infection by releasing reactive oxygen species that kill bacteria and by expressing chemokines that attract other immune cells to the site of infection. The multisubunit enzyme NADPH oxidase expressed by neutrophils produces reactive oxygen species rapidly released in what is known as the respiratory burst. Activity of the NADPH oxidase is induced by fMLP receptor ligands, formylated peptides from bacteria. The fMLP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, FPR-1, that activates Map kinase pathways and phospholipase C. Phospholipase C activation releases IP3 and calcium, activating protein kinase C and also activating the transcription factor NFAT, which contributes to activation of chemokine genes. One of the components of the NADPH oxidase is p47phox. PKC activation phosphorylates p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase activity. Activation of Map kinase cascades leads to Erk1 / Erk2 dependent p47phox phosphorylation as well as activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and chemokine gene expression. Inhibition of p38 did not affect p47phox phosphorylation, indicating that p38 is not involved in Erk1 / 2 activation of the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of p38 did inhibit",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc-gamma-R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.",
  "p53 is a transcription factor who's activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The function is p53 is to keep the cell from progressing through the cell cycle if there is damage to DNA present. It may do this in multiple ways from holding the cell at a checkpoint until repairs can be made to causing the cell to enter apoptosis if the damage cannot be repaired. The critical role of p53 is evidenced by the fact that it is mutated in a very large fraction of tumors from nearly all sources.",
  "The insulin resistance of type II diabetes appears to be caused in part by the presence of high levels of lipids in cells such as skeletal muscle where this would not normally be found. The presence of excess lipid stores in skeletal muscle cells interferes with energy metabolism, impairing glucose oxidation and insulin response. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary glucose-consuming tissues, giving it a central role in insulin resistance. The increased risk of diabetes associated with obesity may be caused by increased lipid deposits in skeletal muscle and liver, creating insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue that has been associated with many processes. One of the target tissues of leptin is the hypothalamus where it can act to regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Another leptin target is skeletal muscle. Activation of leptin signaling in skeletal muscle activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase), known to play a key role in signaling in response to nutrients throughout evolution. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. ACC catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA in turn is an inhibitor of the import",
  "Attachment of the ubiquitin peptide to proteins targets them for proteolytic degradation by a complex cellular structure, the proteasome. The regulated proteolysis of proteins by proteasomes removes denatured, damaged or improperly translated proteins from cells and regulates the level of proteins like cyclins or some transcription factors. E1 and E2 enzymes prepare ubiquitin chains that are then attached to proteins by the E3 enzyme. The sequence of ubiquitin and the basic structure and function of the proteasome are highly conserved. The core proteasome in man (20S proteasome) consists of four rings each with 14 subunits stacked on top of each other that are responsible for the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. The PA700 regulatory complex is stacked on the ends of the cylindrical core to form a 26S proteasome. Proteins that are tagged with ubiquitin are recognized and bound by the regulatory subunits, then unfolded in an ATP-dependent manner, and inserted into the core particle, where proteases degrade the protein, releasing small peptides and releasing the ubiquitin intact. The PA28 regulatory complex is alternative regulatory complex that appears to play a role in antigen processing for presentation of peptides to immune cells in the",
  "Progesterone (Pg) binds to both intracellular iPR and plasma membrane- bound mPR. (Right Top) After binding to Pg, iPR is recruited to the membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase p60c- src, which induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in activation of p90Rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Myt1, which favors formation of the activated cell cycle complex cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 causes breakdown of the germinal vesicle and the initiation of oocyte maturation. (Left). In contrast, binding of Pg to mPR leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through activation of Gi or inhibition of Gs. This leads to a decrease in the cAMPdependent kinase PKA, which relieves inhibition of Cdc25C (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cyclin B-Cdc2) and also indirectly promotes the activation of MAPK signaling. PKA also regulates the initiation of oocyte maturation through other effects that are independent of PKA activity.",
  "In the kidney, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) is a critical regulator of water homeostasis by controlling the water movement from lumen to the interstitium for water reabsorption and adjusting the urinary water excretion. In normal physiology, AVP is secreted into the circulation by the posterior pituitary gland, in response to an increase in serum osmolality or a decrease in effective circulating volume. When reaching the kidney, AVP binds to V2 receptors on the basolateral surface of the collecting duct epithelium, triggering a G-protein-linked signaling cascade, which leads to water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) vesicle insertion into the apical plasma membrane. This results in higher water permeability in the collecting duct and, driven by an osmotic gradient, pro-urinary water then passes the membrane through AQP2 and leaves the cell on the basolateral side via AQP3 and AQP4 water channels, which are constitutively expressed on the basolateral side of these cells. When isotonicity is restored, reduced blood AVP levels results in AQP2 internalization, leaving the apical membrane watertight again.",
  "Cell adhesion is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms including their defense mechanisms. In the later case in mammals, leukocytes play central role. They bind bacteria, parasites, viruses, tumor cells etc. Furthermore, their interactions with the endothelium are of special importance. Generally, lymphocyte adhesion and passage from the bloodstream to the lymphatic system occurs in the high endothelial venules of the lymphnodes. This way the lymphocytes can communicate with each other in the lymphatic system and search for foreign compounds after their recirculation to the bloodstream, this fulfilling their role in the immune system. The reaction passes through the following steps: 1. Rolling (the flow of cells is slowed down by first making contacts to the endothelium via P-, E-, and L-selectins and their receptors); 2.

  "eIF-4F and p70 S6 kinase play critical roles in translational regulation. eIF-4F is a complex whose functions include the recognition of the mRNA 5 'cap structure (eIF-4E), delivery of an RNA helicase to the 5' region (eIF-4A), bridging of the mRNA and the ribosome (eIF-4G), and circularization of the mRNA via interaction between eIF-4G and the poly (A) binding protein (PABP). Several stimuli, including growth factors and cytokines, regulate the eIF-4 complex and p70 S6 kinase by initiating a phosphorylation cascade involving the sequential activation of PI3-K, PDK1 / 2, Akt / PKB, and FRAP / mTOR kinase. FRAP / mTOR, together with an unidentified kinase, phosphorylates 4E-BP, leading to its dissociation from and activation of eIF-4E. MNK1 / 2, activated by ERK and p38 MAPK, phosphorylates and activates eIF-4E. Both processes contribute to the association of eIF-4E and eIF-4G to form the active eIF-4F complex, a necessary component of the 48S initiation",
  "Exposure to divalent cadmium ions (Cd2 +) is a known cancer risk factor, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inappropriate induction of cellular proliferation by cadmium are still being figured out. One cellular model used to study this process is macrophages grown in culture. In cultured macrophages, cadmium acts both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm to induce proliferation. At the cell surface, cadmium interacts with a pertussis-sensitive cell surface receptor, probably a Gi-coupled GPCR, to stimulate proliferation. Cadmium can enter cells through calcium ion channels and once in cells affects calcium release by the ER. In addition to changes in intracellular calcium, the proliferative effects of cadmium are mediated by the Ras / Map kinase pathway, and also NF-kB. Inhibition of phospholipase C, map kinases, or NF-kB with a variety of pharmacological inhibitors all blocked the activation of cellular proliferation by cadmium. Protein kinase C is also activated by cadmium, upstream of the Map kinase pathway. Changes in transcription induced by cadmium include induction of immediate early genes like fos, jun, and myc. In addition to inducing cellular proliferation, cadmium also is slightly genotoxic",
  "The Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway involving eight enzymes essential for energy production through aerobic respiration, and, like glycolysis, arose early in evolution. This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells serving as the cell's main digestive compartment to which all sorts of macromolecules are delivered for degradation. They contain more than 40 hydrolases in an acidic environment (pH of about 5). After synthesis in the ER, lysosomal enzymes are decorated with mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network. They are packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to late endosomes. Substances for digestion are acquired by the lysosomes via a series of processes including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "The epidermis, which provides a protective barrier that undergoes a constant renewal, is a multi-layered tissue with the proliferating cells located in the basal layer. As cells leave the basal layer the underog significant differentiation, biochemical and morphological remodeling. The final differentiation results in the formation of corneocytes. In vitro keratinocytes mimic this process. Several genes mark keratinocyte specific differentiation. Among the most frequently tracked markers are Transglutaminase, Cystatin and Involucrin. The keratinocyte differentiation studies have identified and provided significant detail regarding the involvement of three of the 4 major MAP kinase pathways from several diverse stimuli such as EGF, FAS, TNF and Calicium influx. The p38 cascade is represented twice since both p38alpha (p38) and p38delta (MAPK13) are involved. The keratinocyte differentiation cascased also provide for detailed study of the functions of individual PKC isoforms. It is interesting to note the contrasting functions of the PKC isoforms in this process. In recent studies it has been determined that the cPKC (conventional / classical Protein Kinase C) isoforms, which are calcium-",
  "Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in",
  "Physical interactions between intergrin alpha4beta1 heterodimer expressed on B cells and counter receptors on stroma cells are key mediators of the survival of normal and malignant B cells. Recent data indicate that integrin stimulation increases FBI-1, XIAP, surviving, and CCT4 expression but inhibits Requiem, c-Fos, and caspase 3 and 7 induction.",
  "Mitochondria participate in apoptotic signaling pathways through the release of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase pathway. Smac / DIABLO is released from mitochondria and inhibits IAP proteins that normally interact with caspase-9 to inhibit apoptosis. Apoptosis regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins occurs as family members form complexes that enter the mitochondrial membrane, regulating the release of cytochrome c and other proteins. TNF family receptor that cause apoptosis directly activate the caspase cascade, but can also activate Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, which activates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Bax, another Bcl-2 family member, is activated by this pathway to localize to the mitochondrial membrane and increase its permeability, releasing cytochre c and other mitochondrial proteins. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent pore formation, blocking apoptosis. AIF (Apoptosis inducing factor) is another mitochondrial factor that is released into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis. AIF-induced",
  "Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the",
  "The drug Gleevec (also known as imatinib mesylate or STI-571) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of CML, chronic myeloid leukemia. While traditional cytotoxic cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy kill all dividing cells, Gleevec acts on a molecular target by a mechanism that is more specific to cancer cells. Traditional cytotoxic cancer agents have serious side effects such as nausea, weight loss, hair loss and severe fatigue that result from their lack of specificity in killing cells. Gleevec was designed as an inhibitor of a specific receptor associated with CML, and so produces less severe side effects than other cancer agents. CML is associated in most cases with a specific chromosomal defect, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation occurs at the site in the genome of a protein tyrosine kinase called abl, creating the abnormal bcr-abl protein, a fusion of the abl gene with another gene called bcr. The kinase activity of abl in the bcr-abl fusion is activated and unregulated, driving the uncontrolled cell growth observed in CML. White",
  "As with many cell-surface receptors, activation of the EGF receptor can result in receptor internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis, desensitizing further receptor signaling. This process requires clathrin and occurs in clathrin-coated pits, which pinch off from the plasma membrane to form vesicles that move to the early endosome. From the early endosome, receptors can either be recycled back to the cell surface, or they can move through the late endosome to the lysosome for proteolytic degradation. The sorting of receptors in the early endosome for degradation requires the tyrosine kinase activity of activated growth factor receptor, and involves ubiquitination of the receptor. Targeting of receptors for degradation requires members of the Cbl gene family. Cbl proteins bind to tyrosine phosphorylated EGF receptor, and are E3 ubiquitination ligases that label receptor for degradation. Cbl also recruits Cin85 to the receptor complex, and blocking Cin85 interaction blocks receptor internalization and degradation. Endophilins are also a member of this receptor-bound protein complex. In its role as a ubiquitin ligase and docking protein, Cbl desensitizes EGF signaling and also opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF. EGF activation also appears to",
  "Insulin binding to its receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (INSR). This allows association of IRSs with the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which activates Akt, a serine kinase. Akt in turn deactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), leading to activation of glycogen synthase (GYS) and thus glycogen synthesis. Activation of Akt also results in the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles from their intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, where they allow uptake of glucose into the cell. Akt also leads to mTOR-mediated activation of protein synthesis by eIF4 and p70S6K. The translocation of GLUT4 protein is also elicited through the CAP / Cbl / TC10 pathway, once Cbl is phosphorylated by INSR. Other signal transduction proteins interact with IRS including GRB2. GRB2 is part of the cascade including SOS, RAS, RAF and MEK that leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitogenic responses in the form of",
  "Apoptosis is specifically induced via signaling through a family of receptors known collectively as' death receptors' including Fas, TNFR, DR3, -4 and -5. Death receptor ligands characteristically initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascades. Apo3L recruits initiator caspase 8 via the adapter protein FADD. Caspase 8 then oligomerizes and is activated via autocatalysis. Activated caspase 8 stimulates apoptosis via two parallel cascades: it directly cleaves and activates caspase-3, and it cleaves Bid (a Bcl-2 family protein). Truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria, inducing cytochrome C release, which sequentially activates caspases 9 and 3. DR-3L can deliver pro- or anti-apoptotic signals. DR-3 promote apoptosis via the adaptor proteins TRADD / FADD and the activation of caspase 8. Alternatively, apoptosis inhibited via an adaptor protein complex including RIP which activates NF-kB and induces survival genes including IAP. Induction of apoptosis via Apo2L requires caspase activity, but the adaptor requirement is unclear.",
  "All taste pathways are proposed to converge on common elements that mediate a rise in intracellular Ca2 + followed by neurotransmitter release. Na + salt depolarizes taste cells by passive influx of Na + through the amiloride-sensitive Na + channel (ENaC). Acids depolarize taste cells by a variety of mechanisms, including influx of protons (H +) through ENaC and a proton-gated cation channel (MDEG). Two putative umami receptors have been identified: a truncated variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 and the heterodimer, T1R1 + T1R3. Umami receptors are coupled to a signaling pathway involving activation of PLCbeta2, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activation of a transient receptor potential channel, TRPM5. Bitter compounds, such as denatonium and PROP, activate particular T2R / TRB isoforms, which activate gustducin heterotrimers. Activated alpha-gustducin stimulates PDE to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas betagamma subunits activate PLCbeta2 to generate IP3, which leads to release of Ca2 + from internal stores. Artificial sweeteners activate GPCRs (",
  "The correct processing, quality control and turnover of cellular RNA molecules are critical to many aspects in the expression of genetic information. In eukaryotes, two major pathways of mRNA decay exist and both pathways are initiated by poly (A) shortening of the mRNA. In the 5 'to 3' pathway, this is followed by decapping which then permits the 5 'to 3' exonucleolytic degradation of transcripts. In the 3 'to 5' pathway, the exosome, a large multisubunit complex, plays a key role. The exosome exists in archaeal cells, too. In bacteria, endoribonuclease E, a key enzyme involved in RNA decay and processing, organizes a protein complex called degradosome. RNase E or R interacts with the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, DEAD-box helicases, and additional factors in the RNA-degrading complex.",
  "Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.",
  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. During step 1, the conditioning regimen (irradiation and / or chemotherapy) leads to damage, activation of host tissues and induction of inflammatory cytokines secretion. Increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and adhesion molecules leads to enhancement of the recognition of host MHC and / or minor histocompatibility antigens by mature donor T cells. Donor T-cell activation in step II is characterized by the predominance of Th1 cells and the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. These cytokines induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which leaks through the intestinal mucosa that was damaged during step 1, together with IFN-gamma, from step 2, further stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines and NO. During step 3, the effector",
  "RXR and RAR are nuclear receptors that bind either all trans retinoic (tRA) or 9cis retinoic acid (9cisRA). In the absence of ligand corepressors with histone deacetylase activity are bound to the RAR / RXR hetrodimer and suppress transcription. Once they bind retinoic acid a conformational change in the receptors cause the dissociation of the corepressors and the binding of coactivators with histone acetylase activity (1). Following ligand binding by the hetrodimer the receptors and proteins in the basal transcription machinery (like TBP and TAF135) are degraded by the proteasome (2).",
  "One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",
  "One mechanism used by cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin proteins form pores in the membranes of the attacked cell, allowing the entry of Granzyme A and Granzyme B. Granzyme B induces caspase activation and cleavage of factors like ICAD, releasing DFF40 to fragment DNA, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Granzyme A is also an abundant granzyme released by cytotoxic T cells and is important in cytotoxic T cell induced apoptosis, activating caspase independent pathways. Once in a cell, Granzyme A activates DNA nicking by the recently identified DNAse NM23-H1, a tumor suppressor gene product whose expression is reduced in transformed, metastatic cells. The previous identification of NM23-H1 as a tumor suppressor indicates that its DNAse activity plays an important role in immune surveillance to prevent cancer through the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of NM23-H1 occurs indirectly, through the cleavage of proteins that inhibit NM23-H1 in the SET complex, which includes SET, Ape1, pp32 and",
  "The role of Hemophilus influenzae in ear infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes the induction of an inflammatory response through activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. In addition to activation of inflammatory cytokine genes like IL-1 and TNF, H. influenzae activates TLR2 expression and genes involved in mucus production. Hemophilus influenzae activates NF-kB by multiple mechanisms, starting with activation of the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by the p16 protein in the H. influenzae outer membrane. TLR2 plays a key role in innate immune responses and is expressed in high levels in lymphoid cells as well as low levels in epithelial cells. The role of TLR2 was supported by blocking NF-kB activation with a dominant negative TLR2 and increasing it with transfection of a normal TLR2 gene. TLR2 in turn activates TAK1, which activates two divergent signaling pathways. One of these pathways leads to IkB kinase activation, IkB phosphorylation and degradation, releasing the NF-kB heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. In the alternate pathway, TAK1 also activates NF-kB through a Map kinase pathway, activating p38 and NF",
  "Five distinct stages have been proposed in the evolution of melanoma on the basis of histological criteria: common acquired and congenital nevi without dysplastic changes; dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia; radial-growth phase (RGP) melanoma; vertical-growth phase (VGP) melanoma; and metastatic melanoma. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Moreover, melanoma development is strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a / CDK4,6 / pRb and p14ARF / HMD2 / p53 tumor suppressor pathways. The vertical-growth phase and metastatic melanoma are notable for striking changes in the control of cell adhesion. Recently, amplification of the MITF gene was demonstrated in 10% of primary melanomas and 20% of metastatic melanomas, suggesting that MITF is a melanoma oncogene.",
  "The eukaryotic cell contains compartments with distinct functions bounded by lipid bilayer membranes. The movement of membrane vesicles between these compartments allows proteins in the secretory pathway to move outward from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, trans Golgi network (TGN), secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane and to be secreted into the extracellular environment. The trafficking of membrane vesicles is also essential for endocytosis and the movement of material from the extracellular environment into the early endosome (EE), late endosome (LE) and lysosome. The movement of vesicles and their contents between these compartments and their secretion are essential for a host of cellular functions, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. The movement of membrane vesicles between all of these compartments is regulated by members of the Rab family of GTPases, part of the ras superfamily of genes, regulated through binding of GTP and hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. At least eleven yeast genes in this family have been identified as Ypts, yeast transport proteins, and over sixty mammalian Rab genes have been identified in this highly conserved gene family. The products of the Rab genes regulate specific steps in vesicle transport. Rab1",
  "Clot formation and fibrinolysis is a balance of plasmin activation / inhibition and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity that regulates fibrin polymer formation and degradation. Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cell-mediated immunity by inducing Th1 cell differentiation and activation of both T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages in peripheral tissues act as antigen presenting cells and secrete IL-12 as one component of the antigen response, Th1 differentiation. The role of IL-12 in cellular immunity is largely mediated by the STAT-4 transcription factor. STAT-4 is essential for IL-12 activity and the phenotype of mice lacking STAT-4 is very similar to the phenotype of mice lacking the IL-12 receptor or IL-12. The role of IL-12 in Th1 differentiation may not be to induce the Th1 cell fate, but to stimulate growth of cells determined for the Th1 cell fate by the T-bet transcription factor. Several signaling pathways contribute to IL-12 activation of STAT-4 to regulate cell-mediated immune responses. The JAK kinases such as JAK2 and TYK2 interact with the activated IL-12 receptor and tyrosine phosphorylate the IL-12 receptor and STAT-4. IL-12 also activates",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A) goes by the colloquial designation p16, which is sometimes referred to as p16 (INK4). The alpha transcript of CDKN2A has been shown to encode p16 (INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the RB protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A encodes p14 (ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14 (ARF) is shorter than the corresponding mouse protein, p19 (ARF), and the 2 proteins share only 50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53 response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A and MDM2, and resulting in a distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2 / M phases. Two unrelated proteins encoded by the INK4A-ARF locus function in tumor suppression. ARF binds to MDM2 and promotes the rapid degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the E1-beta-encoded N-terminal domain of",
  "G-aS-coupled receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC), which synthesizes cAMP from ATP. In contrast Gai-coupled receptors inhibit AC and so reduce cAMP formation. The bg subunits from Gai and other G proteins are able to activate the MAP kinase pathways and PLCb. GPCRs coupled to the Gaq family of G proteins stimulate PLCb, which cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce IP3, which mobilizes intracellular calcium, and DAG, which activates PKC. Second messenger pathways then activate a range of effector systems to change cell behaviour; in many cases this includes the regulation of gene transcription. Dotted line shows a more indirect pathway.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR has three subtypes (PPARalpha, beta / delta, and gamma) showing different expression patterns in vertebrates. Each of them is encoded in a separate gene and binds fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPARalpha plays a role in the clearance of circulating or cellular lipids via the regulation of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. PPARbeta / delta is involved in lipid oxidation and cell proliferation. PPARgamma promotes adipocyte differentiation to enhance blood glucose uptake.",
  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVD / C. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt / beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger",
  "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in physiological blood vessel formation and pathological angiogenesis such as tumor growth and ischemic diseases. Hypoxia is a potent inducer of VEGF in vitro. The increase in secreted biologically active VEGF protein from cells exposed to hypoxia is partly because of an increased transcription rate, mediated by binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) to a hypoxia responsive element in the 5 '-flanking region of the VEGF gene. bHLH-PAS transcription factor that interacts with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), and its predicted amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1a) product. HLF mRNA expression is closely correlated with that of VEGF mRNA.. The high expression level of HLF mRNA in the O2 delivery system of developing embryos and adult organs suggests that in a normoxic state, HLF regulates gene expression of VEGF, various glycolytic enzymes, and others driven by the HRE sequence, and may be involved in development of blood vessels and the tubular system of lung. VEGF expression is dramatically induced by hypoxia due in large part to an increase in the stability",
  "The most recognized mechanism by which peroxisome proliferators regulated gene expresssion is through a PPAR / RXR heterodimeric complex binding to a peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) (classical mechanism). However, there are the possibility of several variations on this theme: 1). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR that preexists as a DNA complex with associated corepressors proteins. The interaction with ligand causes release of the corepressor and association with a coactivator, resulting in the classical mechanism. 2). The peroxisome proliferator interacts with PPAR as a soluble member of the nucleus. The binding of ligand results in RXR heterodimerization, DNA binding and coactivator recruitment. 3). In this scenario, PPAR exists in the cytosol, perhaps complexed to heat shock protein 90 and / or other chaperones. Binding of peroxisome proliferator causes a conformational change and translocation into the nucleus. Scenarios 4 and 5 require regulation of gene expression via non-classical mechanisms: 4). PPAR is capable of interacting with, and forming DNA binding heterodimers with, several nuclear receptors including the thyroid hormone receptor. The binding site for this non-RXR heterodimer need",
  "Peroxisomes are essential organelles that play a key role in redox signalling and lipid homeostasis. They contribute to many crucial metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, biosynthesis of ether lipids and free radical detoxification. The biogenesis of peroxisomes starts with the early peroxins PEX3, PEX16 and PEX19 and proceeds via several steps. The import of membrane proteins into peroxisomes needs PEX19 for recognition, targeting and insertion via docking at PEX3. Matrix proteins in the cytosol are recognized by peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS) and transported to the docking complex at the peroxisomal membrane. Peroxisomes' deficiencies lead to severe and often fatal inherited peroxisomal disorders (PD). PDs are usually classified in two groups. The first group is disorders of peroxisome biogenesis which include Zellweger syndrome, and the second group is single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies.",
  "Macrophages and NK cells help provide innate immunity against infection by intracellular parasites and communicate with each other to regulate this process. When stimulated, macrophages secrete the cytokine IL-12 that is essential for activation of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. IL-12 stimulates this NK cell response through activation of a JAK / STAT signaling pathway. Binding of IL-12 to its receptor on NK cells causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and another JAK kinase, Tyk2. Tyk2 in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT4, which can then translocate to the nucleus to activate genes, including the expression of interferon-gamma. IFN-gamma and IL-12 induce the differentiation of TH1 helper T cells that activate macrophages through interferon-gamma. A key modulator of NK cell activation by IL-12 is nitric oxide, NO, produced from arginine by the inducible nitric oxide synthase NOS2. Inactivation of the NOS2 gene in mice impairs the initial innate response to infection, including the activation of NK cells. This phenotype is similar to that of mice lacking interferon-gamma or IL-12 and a",
  "Interaction of T cell receptor with specific antigen in the context of MHC II activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to T cell activation. In the T cell receptor signaling pathway, the src family kinases Lck and Fyn are activated to phosphorylate proteins in the T cell receptor complex which recruit and activate the ZAP70 kinase. The activation of ZAP70 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate MAP kinase pathways and cause T cell activation. The CD45 phosphorylase also plays a role in T cell receptor signaling, dephosphorylated Lck and Fyn to activate them. Other factors modulate T cell receptor activation. Csk (COOH-terminal Srk kinase) phosphorylates Lck and deactivates it, opposing the action of CD45. The phosphorylation of Lck by Csk inhibits T cell receptor signaling and inhibits T cell activation. Csk activity is regulated in T cells by PKA, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated by the second messenger cAMP. The activity of Csk also appears to depend on other factors such as CBP, which recruits Csk to the plasma membrane in lipid rafts where other signaling factors such the T cell receptor complex are localized. CBP also directly activates Csk.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), a multi-functional kinase, and its neuron-specific activator p35 are required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Proteolytic cleavage of p35 produces p25, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conversion of p35 to p25 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of cdk5 and the hyperphosphorylates tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments and promotes apoptosis. In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress and calcium influx induce the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates, addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific inhibitors of calpain1, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In vitro, calpain1 directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative molecular mass 25,000. Application of the amyloid beta-peptide A beta induces the conversion of p35 to p25 in primary cortical neurons. Inhibition of cdk5 or calpain activity reduces cell death in A beta-treated cortical",
  "Endocytosis is a mechanism for cells to remove ligands, nutrients, and plasma membrane (PM) proteins, and lipids from the cell surface, bringing them into the cell interior. Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type.",
  "Oxidative stress is one factor that can trigger programmed cell death. Activated neutrophils responding to inflammatory stimulation produce reactive oxygen species like superoxide free radicals to kill invading bacteria, but these reactive oxygen species can also attack endothelial cells lining the vascular wall and trigger apoptosis. Endothelial cells also produce reactive oxygen species inside the cell that can contribute to oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as during reperfusion injury following ischemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts highly reactive and damaging superoxide free radicals to peroxides that are less reactive than superoxide but stimulate apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) peptide reducing agent removes toxic metabolites and repairs damage created by reactive oxygen species. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), for example, removes peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent, and glutathione reductase (GSR) regenerates reduced glutathione. Inside the endothelial cell peroxide can be converted to hydroxyl ions in the presence of iron. Peroxides and hydroxyl radicals activate NF-kB and activate expression of inflammatory genes including adhesion molecules, TNF and IL-8. The apoptotic response of endothelial cells to oxidative stress may be involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",
  "Progesterone (Pg) binds to both intracellular iPR and plasma membrane- bound mPR. (Right Top) After binding to Pg, iPR is recruited to the membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase p60c- src, which induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in activation of p90Rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Myt1, which favors formation of the activated cell cycle complex cyclin B-Cdc2. Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 causes breakdown of the germinal vesicle and the initiation of oocyte maturation. (Left). In contrast, binding of Pg to mPR leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through activation of Gi or inhibition of Gs. This leads to a decrease in the cAMPdependent kinase PKA, which relieves inhibition of Cdc25C (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cyclin B-Cdc2) and also indirectly promotes the activation of MAPK signaling. PKA also regulates the initiation of oocyte maturation through other effects that are independent of PKA activity.",
  "Glutamatergic-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production occurs via the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) -neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) ternary complex. The increased intracellular Ca2 + stimulates the interaction of nNOS and calmodulin (CaM) and the translocaton of nNOS from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The dephosphorylation of nNOS by Calcineurin catalyzes the conversion of arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), which turns on guanylate cyclase and the various cGMP regulated signaling pathways.",
  "The complement cascade of proteolytic factors involved in cellular lysis can be initiated by several different factors, including antibody-dependent and antibody-independent recognition of infectious organisms. In the lectin-induced complement cascade, carbohydrates on the surface of microbial cells activate the complement cascade by binding to mannan-binding lectin (also called the mannan-binding protein, Mbl / Mbp). Mbp is an acute phase serum protein whose expression is induced by microbial infection. The binding of Mbl to microbial ligands activates the Mbl associated serine proteases Masp1 and Masp2, triggering the cleavage of C2 and C4 to create C4bC2a, a C3 convertase that cleaves large numbers of C3. Masp1 and Masp2 are similar to the C1 protease in the classical complement pathway. Once formed the C3 convertase cleaves and activates the remaining complement factors leading ultimately to formation of a pore in the bacterial membrane by the membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses the bacterial cell. The lectin-induced pathway also appears to play an important role of the activation of phagocytotic cells by infection. Although the initiating event activating the",
  "Bone density and structure is maintained through a balance of bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone deposition by osteoblasts. The combination of simultaneous resorption and deposition creates continual remodeling of bone while excess osteoclast activity leads to an imbalance and a loss of bone density, causing osteoporosis. RANK (receptor activator of NF-kB ligand) is a receptor in the TNF receptor gene family that is involved in osteoclast differentiation. RANK-ligand, also called osteoprotegerin-ligand, binds to RANK, induces receptor dimerization, and activates downstream signaling. Osteoprotegerin is a decoy receptor for RANK-ligand that suppresses osteoclast activity and bone remodeling, helping to maintain balanced bone remodeling. RANK-ligand and osteoprotegerin are produced by osteoblasts and some factors regulate osteoclast activity indirectly through their action on the expression of these factors by osteoblasts. Binding of RANK-ligand to RANK activates signaling through TRAF-6. TRAF-6 induces several downstream signaling events, including activation of NF-kB, c-Fos and the kinase JNK1. Jnk-1 activation contribute to fos activation by RANK-ligand and may be involved in the modulation of RANK-ligand by other factors such as estrogen",
  "Corepressors are coregulators that interact with transcriptional silencers in a variety of pathways such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Abnormal corepressor-silencer interactions have been implicated in a variety of human disease pathways including several types of leukemia. The regulation of the SMRT corepressor via the p38 and Mek-1 Kinase pathway is shown in this diagram. The EFG receptor represents one mechanism by which SMRT function is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. The MEKK1 and p38 pathways are activated by EGF resulting in cross-regulation of SMRT. The induction of SMRT phosphorylation by each pathway is shown, causing SMRT to unbind from the transcription factor complexes represented by RXR, RAR, T3R and PLZF.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant DNA damage repair pathway for the processing of small base lesions, derived from oxidation and alkylation damages. BER is normally defined as DNA repair initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases and completed by either of the two sub-pathways: short-patch BER where only one nucleotide is replaced and long-patch BER where 2-13 nucleotides are replaced. Each sub-pathway of BER relies on the formation of protein complexes that assemble at the site of the DNA lesion and facilitate repair in a coordinated fashion. This process of complex formation appears to provide an increase in specificity and efficiency to the BER pathway, thereby facilitating the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing the accumulation of highly toxic repair intermediates.",
  "Sodium transport across the tight epithelia of Na + reabsorbing tissues such as the distal part of the kidney nephron and colon is the major factor determining total-body Na + levels, and thus, long-term blood pressure. Aldosterone plays a major role in sodium and potassium metabolism by binding to epithelial mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the renal collecting duct cells localized in the distal nephron, promoting sodium resorption and potassium excretion. Aldosterone enters a target cell and binds MR, which translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. Activation of MR leads to increased expression of Sgk-1, which phosphorylates Nedd4-2, an ubiquitin-ligase which targets ENAC to proteosomal degradation. Phosphorylated Nedd4-2 dissociates from ENAC, increasing its apical membrane abundance. Activation of MR also leads to increased expression of Na + / K + -ATPase, thus causing a net increase in sodium uptake from the renal filtrate. The specificity of MR for aldosterone is provided by 11beta-HSD2 by the rapid conversion of cortisol to cortisone in renal cortical collecting duct cells. Recently, besides genomic effects mediated by activated MR, rapid aldosterone actions",
  "Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the control of translation by eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). eIF-2 binds GTP and Met-tRNAi and transfers the Met-tRNA to the 40S subunit, to form the 43S preinitiation complex. Later in the cycle, prior to elongation, the bound GTP is hydrolyzed, releasing eIF-2-GDP. For eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, GDP must be exchanged for GTP, a reaction catalyzed by eIF-2B. Kinases activated by viral infection (PKR), endoplasmic reticulum stress (PERK / PEK), amino acid deprivation (GCN2), and hemin deficiency (HRI) can phosphorylate the a subunit of eIF-2. This phosphorylation stabilizes the eIF-2-GDP-eIF-2B complex, inhibiting the turnover of eIF-2B. eIF-2B is also inhibited by GSK-3b phosphorylation. These events result in a shut-down of cellular protein synthesis and can lead to apoptosis.",
  "RXR and RAR are nuclear receptors that bind either all trans retinoic (tRA) or 9cis retinoic acid (9cisRA). In the absence of ligand corepressors with histone deacetylase activity are bound to the RAR / RXR hetrodimer and suppress transcription. Once they bind retinoic acid a conformational change in the receptors cause the dissociation of the corepressors and the binding of coactivators with histone acetylase activity (1). Following ligand binding by the hetrodimer the receptors and proteins in the basal transcription machinery (like TBP and TAF135) are degraded by the proteasome (2).",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that stimulates neuronal survival and growth through TrkA, a member of the trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors that also includes TrkB and TrkC. Some NGF responses are also mediated or modified by p75LNTR, a low affinity neurotrophin receptor. Binding of NGF to TrkA stimulates neuronal survival, and also proliferation. Pathways coupled to these responses are linked to TrkA through association of signaling factors with specific amino acids in the TrkA cytoplasmic domain. Cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis is signaled through activation of PI3-kinase and AKT. Ras-mediated signaling and phospholipase C both activate the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate proliferation.",

  "B cells must communicate with their environment to participate in the immune system as the source of antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates activation of B cells and T cells through dephosphorylation of signaling factors. CD32 is",
  "N-glycans or asparagine-linked glycans are major constituents of glycoproteins in eukaryotes. N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser / Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases, the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of human diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation.",
  "Macrophages and NK cells help provide innate immunity against infection by intracellular parasites and communicate with each other to regulate this process. When stimulated, macrophages secrete the cytokine IL-12 that is essential for activation of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. IL-12 stimulates this NK cell response through activation of a JAK / STAT signaling pathway. Binding of IL-12 to its receptor on NK cells causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and another JAK kinase, Tyk2. Tyk2 in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT4, which can then translocate to the nucleus to activate genes, including the expression of interferon-gamma. IFN-gamma and IL-12 induce the differentiation of TH1 helper T cells that activate macrophages through interferon-gamma. A key modulator of NK cell activation by IL-12 is nitric oxide, NO, produced from arginine by the inducible nitric oxide synthase NOS2. Inactivation of the NOS2 gene in mice impairs the initial innate response to infection, including the activation of NK cells. This phenotype is similar to that of mice lacking interferon-gamma or IL-12 and a",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. The GnRHR is coupled to Gq / 11 proteins to activate phospholipase C which transmits its signal to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates the intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and IP3 stimulates release of intracellular calcium. In addition to the classical Gq / 11, coupling of Gs is occasionally observed in a cell-specific fashion. Signaling downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Active MAPKs translocate to the nucleus, resulting in activation of transcription factors and rapid induction of early genes.",
  "Within the compact cilia of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) a cascade of enzymatic activity transduces the binding of an odorant molecule to a receptor into an electrical signal that can be transmitted to the brain. Odorant molecules bind to a receptor protein (R) coupled to an olfactory specific Gs-protein (G) and activate a type III adenylyl cyclase (AC), increasing intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP targets an olfactory-specific cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNG), allowing cations, particularly Na and Ca, to flow down their electrochemical gradients into the cell, depolarizing the ORN. Furthermore, the Ca entering the cell is able to activate a Ca-activated Cl channel, which would allow Cl to flow out of the cell, thus further increasing the depolarization. Elevated intracellular Ca causes adaptation by at least two different molecular steps: inhibition of the activity of adenylyl cyclase via CAMKII-dependent phosphorylation and down-regulation of the affinity of the CNG channel to cAMP.Longer exposure to odorants can stimulate particulate guanylyl cyclase in cilia to produce cGMP and activate PKG, leading to a further increase in",
  "Axons extend significant distances to innervate target tissues. At the site of innervation, target tissues release neurotrophins including NGF, BDNF and neurotrophin-3 that stimulate the survival of the associated neuron. Local signaling by activated Trk receptors at the synaptic terminus mediates some presynaptic neuronal responses to neurotrophins. Map kinase pathways activated by Trk receptor activate Erk1 and Erk2 at the terminus stimulating axonal growth, and PI3K activates AKT in the terminus as well. Activation of these kinases does not propagate a signal to the cell body though and does not induce a transcriptional response. This local signaling at the terminus or local signaling at the cell body appears distinct from the signaling pathway that transduces the survival signal from the target tissue. Retrograde axonal transport plays an essential role in neuronal survival induced by neurotrophins released at the target tissue. Failure of retrograde neurotrophin signaling may play a role in neurodegenerative conditions. The neuronal survival signal is initiated by binding of neurotrophins to Trk receptors in the presynaptic membrane, then travels back along the axon to the neuronal cell body. To transmit the signal back along the axon, activated Trk receptors are internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis and receptor containing",
  "Telomeres, which define the ends of chromosomes, consist of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences loosely conserved in eukaryotes. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex (we only show a few of the components in this illustration) which in vitro recognizes a single-stranded G-rich telomere primer and adds multiple telomeric repeats to its 3-prime end by using an RNA template. Telomerase may also have a role in de novo formation of telomeres. Telomerase has been identified in many cultured cell lines and actively dividing cell types. The active reverse transcriptase component has been identified in teh TERT protein. The presence of this factor determines the availability of the telomerase function. The TERT protein has a high turnover rate and its expression is regulated by factors that promote growth (c-MYC, v-k-ras, Bcl-2 and E6) and inhibiting factors (RB and p53) that promote cell death or that block cell division. It appears that the regulation of active telomerase has many levels and can be inhibited by TEP1 not releasing TERT or by TRF1 which binds the end repeats and prevents access to the chromosome ends.

  "One of responses to increased blood pressure is cardiac hypertrophy through increased size of ventricular myocardial cells leading to increased thickness of the ventricular walls. Cardiac hypertrophy allows the heart to handle the increased stress caused by elevated blood pressure but is also a risk factor associated with heart disease. Cardiac hypertrophy results from cross-talk between G-protein coupled receptor signaling and the EGF receptor pathway. Several GPCR ligands are known to stimulate cardiac hypertrophy, including factors that regulate blood pressure such as angiotensin II and endothelin- 1. These factors stimulate phospholipase C through Gq activation, and the production of 1P3 and diacylglycerol second messengers. PKC-delta is activated by DAG and interacts with the metalloproteinase ADAM12. ADAM12 cleaves the membrane-bound HB-EGF to release soluble EGF ligand that activates EGF receptor in myocardial cells. EGF receptor activation downstream through small G proteins and the MAP kinase pathway ultimately leads to cardiac hypertrophy. Signals by GPCR ligands such as angiotensin II result in transcriptional translation of immediate early genes like fos and other genes involved in long-term remodeling of heart tissue and the physiological response to stress in the heart such as the atrial natriuretic",
  "Many cell-surface receptors induce production of second messengers like PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, that convey signals to the cytoplasm from the cell surface. PIP3 signals activates the kinase PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, which in turn activates the kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B. Proteins phosphorylated by activated AKT promote cell survival. Phosphorylation of Ikappa-B kinase leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-kB to oppose apoptosis. Bad is a protein in the Bcl-2 gene family that opposes Bcl-2 to induce apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Bad by AKT blocks anti-apoptotic activity to promote cell survival. Similarly, phosphorylation of the protease caspase 9 or forkhead transcription factors by AKT block the induction of apoptosis by these factors. AKT promotes cell survival and opposes apoptosis by a variety of routes.",
  "The G1 / S cell cycle checkpoint controls the passage of eukaryotic cells from the first 'gap' phase (G1) into the DNA synthesis phase (S). Two cell cycle kinases, CDK4 / 6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E, and the transcription complex that includes Rb and E2F are pivotal in controlling this checkpoint. During G1 phase, the Rb-HDAC repressor complex binds to the E2F-DP1 transcription factors, inhibiting the downstream transcription. Phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4 / 6 and CDK2 dissociates the Rb-repressor complex, permitting transcription of S-phase genes encoding for proteins that amplify the G1 to S phase switch and that are required for DNA replication. Many different stimuli exert checkpoint control including TGFb, DNA damage, contact inhibition, replicative senescence, and growth factor withdrawal. The first four act by inducing members of the INK4 or Kip / Cip families of cell cycle kinase inhibitors. TGFb additionally inhibits the transcription of Cdc25A, a phosphatase that activates the cell cycle kinases. Growth factor withdrawal activates GSK3b, which phosphorylates cyclin D, leading to its rapid ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation.",
  "p27 / Kip1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase cdk2 / cyclin E and blocking cell cycle progression through the G1-S transition. Cancer cells in some cases have reduced levels of p27, supporting the importance of p27 in cell cycle regulation. The activity of p27 is regulated by phosphorylation, synthesis and degradation. Phosphorylation of p27 at threonine-187 by cdk2 causes p27 to associate with an SCF complex that targets p27 for proteolytic degradation. The F box protein Skp2 binds specifically to threonine-187 phosphorylated p27, recruiting it to the SCF complex for degradation. Other components of the p27 ubiquitin ligase complex include Skp1, Cul1, and Roc1 / Rbx-1. Cks-1 has also been identified in a reconstituted system as an essential component for recruitment of p27 for degradation by the SCF complex. Signaling by cytokines may modulate cell survival, proliferation, or apoptosis through modulation of p27 expression. Cytokine and AKT signaling pathways activate forkhead transcription factors that induce p27 expression at the transcriptional",

  "All taste pathways are proposed to converge on common elements that mediate a rise in intracellular Ca2 + followed by neurotransmitter release. Na + salt depolarizes taste cells by passive influx of Na + through the amiloride-sensitive Na + channel (ENaC). Acids depolarize taste cells by a variety of mechanisms, including influx of protons (H +) through ENaC and a proton-gated cation channel (MDEG). Two putative umami receptors have been identified: a truncated variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 and the heterodimer, T1R1 + T1R3. Umami receptors are coupled to a signaling pathway involving activation of PLCbeta2, production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and activation of a transient receptor potential channel, TRPM5. Bitter compounds, such as denatonium and PROP, activate particular T2R / TRB isoforms, which activate gustducin heterotrimers. Activated alpha-gustducin stimulates PDE to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas betagamma subunits activate PLCbeta2 to generate IP3, which leads to release of Ca2 + from internal stores.

  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein identified genetically as an important developmental factor. Shh provides a morphogenic signal in the developing CNS, organizing the spatial patterning of cells in the midbrain and inducing proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum, neural tube and retina. Proliferative signaling by Shh is involved in the development of cancer, including specific brain and skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Sonic hedgehog signaling may proceed by more than one mechanism. One signaling pathway is activated by Shh binding to Patched (Ptc-1) which releases inhibition of the GPCR Smoothened, activating the Shh signaling pathway and allowing progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Shh can also affect progression through the G2 / M transition. Patched binds to phosphorylated Cyclin B1, one component of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), along with the kinase Cdc2. The interaction of Cyclin B1 with Patched blocks MPF activity, blocking progression through the G2 / M transition. Shh binding leads to degradation of Ptc-1, release of Cyclin B1, and entry of the cyclin B1 into the nucleus. Pat",
  "T helper cells play an essential role coordinating the activities of other parts of the immune system, including B cells, cytotoxic T cells, macrophages and other cells. The crucial nature of helper T cells in the normal immune response is demonstrated by the severe immune deficiency associated with the HIV-induced helper T cell depletion. To communicate with other cells, helper T cells express a range of cell surface molecules, a few of which are illustrated in this figure. Like all T cells, helper T cells express T cell receptors complexed with the CD3 proteins that are responsible for the recognition and response of the cell to specific antigens. CD4 is commonly used as a marker for helper T cells, in contrast to cytotoxic T cells, which express CD8. CD4 is used by HIV to gain cell entry, as well as the CCR5 chemokine receptor. Thy1 provides a more general cell surface antigen used to identify both T helper and cytotoxic T cells. CD28 provides a costimulatory signal in association with the activation of the T cell receptor complex by an antigen presenting cell that is required for the T cell to become activated.

  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1 (a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1), parkin, DJ1 (a parkin-associated protein involved with oxidative stress), and PINK1 (a putative serine threonine kinase) are known to cause early-onset PD. Mutations or altered expression of these proteins contributes to PD pathogenesis through common mechanisms that result in proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress. Point mutations in alpha-synuclein and the recently described Iowan functional duplication of alpha-synuclein lead to excessive intracellular accumulation and protofibril formation. Decrease in the amount of soluble alpha-synuclein tends to increase free cytoplasmic dopamine and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, formation of protofibrils or aggregates and Lewy bodies (LBs) diminishes the availability of the physiological forms of alpha-synuclein, favoring an increase in TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) and DAT (dopamine transporter), but diminishes vesicles formation and neuronal plasticity. Modification of parkin and UCHL1 are associated with the",
  "Inflammation has several distinct components, including the localized response at the site of tissue injury or infection. Tissue injury stimulates the release of inflammatory signaling molecules such as bradykinin. Bacterial infection stimulates an immune response in several ways. Bacteria that are phagocytosed can activate macrophages, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. Bacteria can also activate the complement cascade through either the antibody-mediated pathway (classical pathway) or the alternative complement pathway. In extravascular tissues, cells that respond to infection or injury include macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages and other immune cells secrete chemokines that recruit leukocytes from the circulation to the site of inflammation. Mast cells release histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes that act as chemokines, increase vascular permeability, and act on the vascular endothelium to increase tissue recruitment of leukocytes. Chemokines can recruit leukocytes or lymphocytes out of the blood stream into tissues and make blood vessels more permeable. Leukocytes are activated by inflammatory signals to express adhesion molecules that cause them to interact with the vascular endothelium, penetrate the endothelial wall and migrate into the extracellular space of tissues. The combined response of immune",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to infection by the immune system that requires communication between different classes of immune cells to coordinate their actions. Acute inflammation is an important part of the immune response, but chronic inappropriate inflammation can lead to destruction of tissues in autoimmune disorders and perhaps neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disease. Secreted cytokine proteins provide signals between immune cells to coordinate the inflammatory response. Some cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF act to broadly provoke the inflammatory response while others act on specific types of immune cells. Macrophages and other phagocytotic cells provide a front-line defense against bacterial infection. Macrophages stimulate the inflammatory responses of neutrophils, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in response infection by secreting IL-1 and TNF. IL-1 and TNF cause fever through alteration of the body temperature set-point in the hypothalamus. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to IL-1 and TNF by recruiting more immune cells to the site of inflammation. Secreted IL-8 is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils to sites of infection. Macrophages also present antigen to T helper cells that play a central role in coordinating immune responses. T helper cells induce clonal",
  "This diagram is a compilation of Pyk2 effort cascades. In specific cell types the receptor and effoectors will vary. Binding of a transmembrane receptor triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1. In turn, Rac1 initiatates the JNK cascade, starting with PAK follwed by MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK. JNK activation causes induction of c-Jun gene binding. Pyk2 stimulation has also been shown to activate MKK3 leading to activation of p38. The other major mitogen activated kinase cascade for ERK1 / 2 is stimulated via RAS, RAF and MEKK1 / 2.",
  "Signaling by interferon-gamma stimulates anti-viral responses and tumor suppression through the heterodimeric interferon-gamma receptor. Signaling is initiated by binding of interferon-gamma to its receptor, activating the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate STAT transcription factors that activate interferon responsive genes. Molecular chaperones that modulate or alter protein folding interact with different components of the interferon signaling pathway. One chaperone that modulates interferon signaling is hTid-1, a member of the DnaJ family of chaperones and a cochaperone for the heat shock protein Hsp70, another molecular chaperone. hTid-1 was found in a two-hybrid screen to bind to JAK2 and also to interact with the interferon-gamma receptor. In addition, hTid-1 and JAK2 also interact with Hsp70. Overexpression of hTid-1 represses transcriptional activation by interferon-gamma and Hsp70 dissociates from these proteins when interferon is added to cells, suggesting that Hsp70 holds Jak2 in an inactive conformation prior to ligand activation, and is released in the presence of agonist to allow the activation of Jak-2 and downstream pathway",
  "Xenopus oocytes are naturally arrested at G2 of meiosis I. Exposure to either insulin / IGF-1 or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks this arrest and induces resumption of the two meiotic division cycles and maturation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg. This process is termed oocyte maturation. The transition is accompanied by an increase in maturation promoting factor (MPF or Cdc2 / cyclin B) which precedes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Most reports point towards the Mos-MEK1-ERK2 pathway and the polo-like kinase / CDC25 pathway as responsible for the activation of MPF in meiosis, most likely triggered by a decrease in cAMP.",
  "Helper T cells are found in two distinct cell types, Th1 and Th2, distinguished by the cytokines they produce and respond to and the immune responses they are involved in. Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-g, TNF-b and IL-2, while Th2 cells produce the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. The cytokines produced by Th1 cells stimulate the phagocytosis and destruction of microbial pathogens while Th2 cytokines like IL-4 generally stimulate the production of antibodies directed toward large extracellular parasites. IL-5 stimulates eosinophil responses, also part of the immune response toward large extracellular parasites Th1 and Th2 are produced by differentiation from a non-antigen exposed precursor cell type, Thp. Exposure of Thp cells to antigen by antigen-presenting cells may result in their differentiation to Th0 cells, not yet committed to become either Th1 or Th2 cells, although the existence of Th0 cells is controversial. Cells committed as either Th1 and Th2 cells are called polarized, whether they are effector cells actively secreting cytokines or are memory cells. The stimulation of Thp cells",
  "The function of hemoglobin in oxygen transport by red blood cells requires precise assembly of a tetramer of two beta-subunits and two alpha-units. If too many beta-subunits are present, then all tetramers of beta-subunits are formed that bind oxygen but do not release it when needed. When alpha-subunits are in excess they form precipitates with oxidized heme that damage red blood cells. Red blood cells require a precise coregulation of alpha and beta subunit expression to maintain the proper ratio of the subunits and normal red blood cell function. Generally red blood cells express slightly more alpha than beta-subunits to avoid forming unproductive beta-tetramers (HbH). The slight excess of alpha units are blocked from precipitation by a molecular chaperone, AHSP, alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein. Expression of the AHSP gene is coordinately activated with the globin genes and heme biosynthesis genes by the GATA-1 gene involved in erythrocyte differentiation. AHSP blocks precipitation of alpha-units, and promotes the formation of normal productive alpha-beta tetramers (HbA). People with mutation or deletion of the beta-subunit gene have Beta-thalasse",
  "IL-10 is a cytokine with potent anti-inflammatory properties, repressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 by activated macrophages. The IL-10 receptor is in the JAK / STAT class of receptors but activation of the JAK / STAT pathways by IL-10 does not appear on its own to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of this cytokine. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 appear to require induction of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through a map kinase pathway involving the p38 kinases. HO-1 is involved in the biosynthesis of heme, and catalyzes a reaction producing carbon monoxide, free iron, and the heme precursor biliverdin. HO-1 is induced by IL-10 and is also induced by oxidative stress. Blocking HO-1 with inhibitors or antisense blocks the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10. The anti-inflammatory actions of HO-1 appear to be the result of signaling by carbon monoxide it produces since removal of CO blocks the anti-inflammatory action",
  "The scanning translation initiation model suggests that 40S ribosomal subunit preloaded with factors bind to the 5 end of the mRNA near the cap. The 48S subunit moves along the mRNA until it finds the initiation triplet and in complex with tRNA and 60S subunit formed the first peptide bond. Translation control is mostly regulated at the protein initiation step through translation initiation factors such as eIF2 or eIF4.",
  "Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor, which binds to a serum response element (SRE) associated with a variety of genes including (i) immediate early genes such as c-fos, fosB, junB, egr-1 and -2, (ii) neuronal genes such as nurr1 and nur77, and (iii) muscle genes such as actins and myosins. By regulating expression of these genes, SRF controls cell growth and differentiation, neuronal transmission as well as muscle development and function. SRF can be activated by serum, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), agents that increase intracellular Ca2 +, T-cell virus1 activator protein, hepatitis B virus activator proteins pX, activated oncogenes and protooncogenes and extracellular stimuli such as antioxidant and UV light. In serum-starved cells, MAL is predominantly cytoplasmic where it is sequestered by actin monomers. Upon serum stimulation, Rho becomes active and, through its interaction with ROCK and",
  "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals primarily through the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). The activities of IL-1 include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and roles in arthritis and septic shock. The inflammatory activities of IL-1 are partially derived by transcriptionally inducing expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interferons, as well as inducing the expression of other inflammation-related genes. There are two forms of IL-1 encoded by distinct genes, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta is produced as a 269 amino acid precursor that is cleaved by IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) to the active IL-1 beta form that is secreted. IL-1 signaling is opposed by the naturally occurring peptide IL-1 receptor antagonist which is a therapeutic agent for the treatment of arthritis. The type 1 IL-1 receptor protein binds IL-1 beta but requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to transduce a signal. IL-1 binding",
  "For a T cell to be activated by a specific antigen, the T cell receptor must recognize complexes of MHCI with the antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. T cells and the T cell receptor complex do not respond to antigen in solution, but even for the specific antigen they only respond to antigen-MHC-1 complexes on the cell surface. This interaction is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. T cell activation also requires a co-stimulatory signal involving interaction of CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 family genes) on the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 activates a signal transduction pathway acting through PI-3K, Lck and Grb-2 / ITK to provide its co-stimulatory signal for T cell activation. Another means to control T cell activation is by expressing factors that down-regulate T cell activation. Signaling by activated T cell receptors induces expression of CTLA-4, a receptor that opposes T cell activation. CTLA-4 has a higher affinity than CD28 for B7 proteins, terminating T cell activation.",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is most commonly known as the cytokine secreted by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production and is used as a drug for the treatment of anemias. Epo is also secreted in the brain in response to hypoxia, such as ischemic stroke. Epo production in the brain is stimulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Administration of Epo to the brain in rodents before hypoxic stress or other neuronal stresses is neuroprotective, preventing neuronal apoptosis. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is known to associate with JAK kinases that phosphorylate and activate the STAT family of transcription factors. The neuroprotection by Epo involves cross-talk between Epo receptor and anti-apoptotic pathways through activation of NF-kB by the JAK2 kinase. Epo stimulates JAK2 phosphorylation of I-kB, releasing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of neuroprotective genes. Neuroprotective genes activated by NF-kB include the anti-oxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase and calbindin-D (28k). The erythropoietin receptor is also essential for proper brain development in mice. The absence of EpoR causes high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the developing",
  "Monocytes are a class of phagocytes involved in non-specific immune defense that develop into macrophages. In plasma, monocytes ingest and destroy bacteria, and can form macrophages when they enter the extracellular space in tissues. In addition to the immune protection that monocytes provide, they may contribute to disease states such as arthritis and heart disease through an aberrant immune response. As with other immune cells, the immune function and differentiation of monocytes rely on communication with other cells through cell surface proteins. Cell surface proteins are involved in both interaction and adhesion with other cells and in transducing signals into the cellular interior. The LFA-1 integrin (Leukocyte function-associated molecule 1) is composed of two subunits, CD11a and CD18 and is involved in monocytes adhesion with ICAM-1 endothelial cells. Mac-1 is composed of the subunits CD11b and CD18 and is induced during inflammation as well. PECAM-1 mediates the migration of monocytes and other immune cells into inflamed tissues through interaction with vascular endothelial cells. CD44 interaction of leukocytes with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix is induced by inflammation. VLA-4 is another integrin",
  "While T cells and B cells carry out the actions of antigen-specific immune responses, antigen-presenting cells called dendritic cells are required for this to happen. The name of dendritic cells is based on their shape, with activated dendritic cells displaying long processes on their surface. When immature dendritic cells found throughout the body internalize and present antigen, they express markers that stimulate the activation of lymphocytes, and migrate to lymphocyte rich tissues like the spleen and lymph nodes to initiate immune responses. In addition to stimulating responses against antigens, dendritic cells also produce tolerance to self antigens. Dendritic cells can be derived from either myeloid or lymphoid lineages. Monocyte derived lineages (pDC1) stimulate Th1 cell differentiation while plasmacytoid (lymphoid) dendritic cells (pDC2) induce Th2 cell differentiation. Factors that stimulate the maturation of monocytes derived dendritic cells include GM-CSF, and IL-4. IL-3 stimulates the differentiation of pDC2 cells into DC2 cells. A variety of factors are involved in antigen-recognition and processing by immature dendritic cells and in the maturation of these cells. The transition to mature dendritic cells down-regulates the factors involved in",
  "There is now much evidence that VEGFR-2 is the major mediator of VEGF-driven responses in endothelial cells and it is considered to be a crucial signal transducer in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to a cascade of different signaling pathways, resulting in the up-regulation of genes involved in mediating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and promoting their survival and vascular permeability. For example, the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to dimerization of the receptor, followed by intracellular activation of the PLCgamma; PKC-Raf kinase-MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth, whereas activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway leads to increased endothelial-cell survival. Activation of PI3K, FAK, and p38 MAPK is implicated in cell migration signaling.",
  "This diagram is a compilation of Pyk2 effort cascades. In specific cell types the receptor and effoectors will vary. Binding of a transmembrane receptor triggers the activation of Ca2 + signaling and PKC. The signal is then transmitted to Pyk2 and further to the small G protein Rac1. In turn, Rac1 initiatates the JNK cascade, starting with PAK follwed by MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK. JNK activation causes induction of c-Jun gene binding. Pyk2 stimulation has also been shown to activate MKK3 leading to activation of p38. The other major mitogen activated kinase cascade for ERK1 / 2 is stimulated via RAS, RAF and MEKK1 / 2.",
  "About 2-5% of type II diabetic patients suffer from a monogenic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. This monogenic form of type II diabetes is called maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We now know that MODY is caused by heterozygous mutations in at least five genes encoding transcription factors: HNF4alpha (MODY1), HNF1alpha (MODY3), PDX1 (MODY4), HNF1beta (MODY5) and NEUROD1 (MODY6). MODY2, which is so far the only subtype not related to a transcription factor, is caused by mutations in the glucokinase gene. Mutations of MODY transcription factor genes lead to abnormal expression of genes involved in pancreatic islet development and metabolism.",
  "Leukocyte migaration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation. During this diapedesis of leukocytes, the leukocytes bind to endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM) and then migrate across the vascular endothelium. A leukocyte adherent to CAMs on the endothelial cells moves forward by leading-edge protrusion and retraction of its tail. In this process, alphaL / beta2 integrin activates through Vav1, RhoA, which subsequently activates the kinase p160ROCK. ROCK activation leads to MLC phosphorylation, resulting in retraction of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Leukocytes activate endothelial cell signals that stimulate endothelial cell retraction during localized dissociation of the endothelial cell junctions. ICAM-1-mediated signals activate an endothelial cell calcium flux and PKC, which are required for ICAM-1 dependent leukocyte migration. VCAM-1 is involved in the opening of the endothelial passage through which leukocytes can extravasate. In this regard, VCAM-1 ligation induces NADPH oxidase activation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a Rac-mediated manner, with subsequent activation of matrix metallopoteinases and loss of VE-cadherin-mediated",
  "p53 activation is induced by a number of stress signals, including DNA damage, oxidative stress and activated oncogenes. The p53 protein is employed as a transcriptional activator of p53-regulated genes. This results in three major outputs; cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence or apoptosis. Other p53-regulated gene functions communicate with adjacent cells, repair the damaged DNA or set up positive and negative feedback loops that enhance or attenuate the functions of the p53 protein and integrate these stress responses with other signal transduction pathways.",
  "Eosinophils are a key class of leukocytes involved in inflammatory responses, including allergic reactions in skin and airway. The eosinophil response in inflammation is absent in mice lacking CCR3, indicating the key role of this G protein coupled receptor in inflammation and allergic responses. Eotaxin is a chemokine ligand for CCR3 that recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation and activates them. Other chemokine ligands of CCR3 include eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Multiple signaling pathways activated by CCR3 participate in the inflammatory response of eosinophils. Eotaxin stimulates intracellular calcium release, production of reactive oxygen species, and changes in actin polymerization through a pertussis sensitive pathway. Rho and ROCK regulate actin stress fiber formation and are required for eosinophil chemotaxis. Rho is a G protein that activates ROCK, a protein kinase. Map kinase pathways are also involved in chemotaxis. Another key action of activated eosinophils is the release of reactive oxygen species, causing tissue damage during chronic inflammatory responses. Blocking eosinophil activation and the signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, degranulation and reactive oxygen release may alleviate inflammatory conditions and inflammation-associated tissue damage.",
  "Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite of macrophages that causes visceral, mucosal, and cutaneous diseases. The parasite is transmitted to humans by sandflies, where they survive and proliferate intracellularly by deactivating the macrophage. Successful infection of Leishmania is achieved by alteration of signaling events in the host cell, leading to enhanced production of the autoinhibitory molecules like TGF-beta and decreased induction of cytokines such as IL12 for protective immunity. Nitric oxide production is also inhibited. In addition, defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes silences subsequent T cell activation mediated by macrophages, resulting in abnormal immune responses.",
  "The IL-2 receptor is a key component of immune signaling and is required for the activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. This receptor is composed of three polypeptide chains, the alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2 receptor gamma chain is a common component for several other cytokine receptors, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. The IL-2 receptor beta chain is essential for IL-2 signaling and is also a component of the IL-15 receptor complex. The polypeptides of the IL-2 receptor do not themselves have intrinsic catalytic activity, but interact with cytoplasmic signaling proteins to transduce signals. br > Different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor beta chain interact and couple with distinct signaling pathways and cellular responses. JAK1 associates with the beta chain, and JAK3 with the gamma chain. Binding of IL-2 induces heterodimerization of receptor subunits, and activation of JAK kinase activity. Tyrosine residues in the beta chain cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated during activation, recruiting other factors to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues through src homology 2 (SH2) domains",
  "Erythropoietin functions to increase the number of red blood cells. Thus, it has found utility as a drug for those needing to replenish erythrocytes for a number of reasons. The signaling mechanism includes multimerization of the receptor upon ligand binding, activation of MAPK cascade, and phosphorylation and activation of Stat5.",
  "G-aS-coupled receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC), which synthesizes cAMP from ATP. In contrast Gai-coupled receptors inhibit AC and so reduce cAMP formation. The bg subunits from Gai and other G proteins are able to activate the MAP kinase pathways and PLCb. GPCRs coupled to the Gaq family of G proteins stimulate PLCb, which cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce IP3, which mobilizes intracellular calcium, and DAG, which activates PKC. Second messenger pathways then activate a range of effector systems to change cell behaviour; in many cases this includes the regulation of gene transcription. Dotted line shows a more indirect pathway.",
  "A key part of the immune system is the production of immunoglobulins (antibodies) by B cells to bind and inactivate specific foreign antigens. The body produces B cells with a wide range of antigen specificities in the immunoglobulin B cell receptor, one antigen specificity per cell. When the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds antigen, that cell is activated to proliferate and create plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins to bind that specific antigen. B cell activation also creates memory cells with the same antigen specificity that do not actively secrete immunoglobulin but provide for rapid future immune responses to the same antigen. B cells are not activated by antigen on their own, but require interaction with helper CD4 + T cells to become activated and proliferate. The B cell first expresses immunoglobulin on the cell surface as the B cell receptor. If the B cell receptor immunoglobulin binds specific antigen, then the cell internalizes the antigen and presents it to T cells in MHC II, where it is recognized by the T cell receptor. In addition to the interaction between the T cell receptor and the B cell MHC-antigen, T cell interaction with the B cell involves additional positive and negative regulatory signals. CD4",
  "HIV infection is associated with immunosuppression caused by a dramatic reduction in the helper T cell population. The loss of helper T cells may be caused by HIV-induced apoptosis of both infected and uninfected helper T cells. HIV uses the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor for macrophage cell entry and upregulates fas-ligand on these cells. CD4 on helper T cells is essential for viral cell entry and infection. Cross-linking of CD4 on the T cell surface may be involved in upregulation of Fas and sensitization of T cells to apoptosis induced by the Fas / Fas-ligand interaction.",
  "CD4 + helper T cells differentiate into distinct subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells. Th2 cells are involved in the response to extracellular helminthe parasites and allergic responses and secrete a distinct set of cytokines including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. The development and differentiation of T cells is influenced by many factors, including transcription factors such as GATA-3, a transcription factor associated with induction of Th2 cells. Factors that increase cAMP levels in Th2 cells activate p38 kinase, which phosphorylates and activates GATA-3 independently of PKA. Cells expressing GATA-3 develop the profile of Th2 cells, secreting IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. These cytokines are found in a gene cluster together and are regulated coordinately by GATA-3. Binding of GATA-3 in the regulatory regions of these genes alters chromatin structure, increasing accessibility to other transcription factors. Activation of the T cell receptor through interaction with antigen on antigen presenting cells activates NFAT and other transcription factors that cooperate with GATA-3 in inducing Th2 cell differentiation. Dominant negative GATA-3 can repress the secretion of these cytokines and block",
  "One defense against viral infection is provided by PKR, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase. When PKR interacts with dsRNA found in cells during viral infection, PKR phosphorylates itself and cellular proteins including the translation factor elF2a and the transcription factor NF-kB. The repression of translation caused by phosphorylation of elF2a prevents cells from producing viral proteins and creating infectious viral particles. PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR to promote successful infection. Another substrate of PKR, the tumor suppressor p53, may be involved in potential PKR regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.",
  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous term comprising a group of neoplasms of renal origin. There are 4 major histologic subtypes of RCC: conventional (clear cell RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Multiple genes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for hereditary (von Hippel-Lindau) and sporadic variants of conventional (clear cell) RCC. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. An oncogene, MET has been found to be mutant in cases of hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), although the incidence of c-MET mutations is low in sporadic papillary RCC. Once activated, MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome (HLRCC",
  "The function of hemoglobin in oxygen transport by red blood cells requires precise assembly of a tetramer of two beta-subunits and two alpha-units. If too many beta-subunits are present, then all tetramers of beta-subunits are formed that bind oxygen but do not release it when needed. When alpha-subunits are in excess they form precipitates with oxidized heme that damage red blood cells. Red blood cells require a precise coregulation of alpha and beta subunit expression to maintain the proper ratio of the subunits and normal red blood cell function. Generally red blood cells express slightly more alpha than beta-subunits to avoid forming unproductive beta-tetramers (HbH). The slight excess of alpha units are blocked from precipitation by a molecular chaperone, AHSP, alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein. Expression of the AHSP gene is coordinately activated with the globin genes and heme biosynthesis genes by the GATA-1 gene involved in erythrocyte differentiation. AHSP blocks precipitation of alpha-units, and promotes the formation of normal productive alpha-beta tetramers (HbA). People with mutation or deletion of the beta-subunit gene have Beta-thalasse",
  "Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy, is the molecular basis for learning and memory. Tetanic stimulation of afferents in the CA1 region of the hippocampus induces glutamate release and activation of glutamate receptors in dendritic spines. A large increase in i resulting from influx through NMDA receptors leads to constitutive activation of CaM kinase II (CaM KII). Constitutively active CaM kinase II phosphorylates AMPA receptors, resulting in potentiation of the ionic conductance of AMPA receptors. Early-phase LTP (E-LTP) expression is due, in part, to this phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized that postsynaptic Ca2 + increases generated through NMDA receptors activate several signal transduction pathways including the Erk / MAP kinase and cAMP regulatory pathways. The convergence of these pathways at the level of the CREB / CRE transcriptional pathway may increase expression of a family of genes required for late-phase LTP (L-LTP).",
  "The transcription factor CREB binds the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and activates transcription in response to a variety of extracellular signals including neurotransmitters, hormones, membrane depolarization, and growth and neurotrophic factors. Protein kinase A and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CaMKII stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, a key regulatory site controlling transcriptional activity. Growth and neurotrophic factors also stimulate CREB phosphorylation at Ser133. Phosphorylation occurs at Ser133 via p44 / 42 MAP Kinase and p90RSK and also via p38 MAP Kinase and MSK1. CREB exhibit deficiencies in spatial learning tasks, while flies overexpressing or lacking CREB show enhanced or diminished learning, respectively.",
  "Migration of cells is involved in essential functions such as development, invasiveness of cancer cells, leukocyte movement toward chemotactic signals, and fibroblast response to injury. Cells can migrate in a specific direction in response to extracellular signals through pathways that trigger changes in the cytoskeleton, particularly actin filaments, increasing lamellipodia and filopodia formation and decreasing focal adhesions. Factors like PDGF activate PI3 kinase and multiple pathways downstream to stimulate cell migration. One pathway regulating migration through the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase does not require PI3-kinase activity. In this pathway, p85 of PI3-kinase activates cdc42, which activates N-Wasp (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) to regulate ARP-2 / 3. ARP-2 / 3 is a complex of proteins localized at the leading edge of moving cells that nucleates the formation of new actin fibers and interacts with Wasp to stimulate migration. The cdc42 pathway also regulates p21-activate kinase 1 (PAK1). Another pathway by which PI3 kinase regulates migration is through the small GTPase Rac. PAK1 is a downstream target of Rac as well as",
  "Clot formation and fibrinolysis is a balance of plasmin activation / inhibition and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity that regulates fibrin polymer formation and degradation. Active thrombin is produced by the cleavage of prothrombin in the intrinsic thrombin activation pathway or the extrinsic thrombin activation pathway. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the fibrin monomers that auto-polymerize within seconds into fibrin threads or fibers. The coagulation cascade has many feedback loops. One example is the binding of thrombin to the fibrin polymers resulting in a reduction in soluble thrombin. The fibers form a more stable clot as a result of the covalent bonds formed by activated factor XIII enzyme (also known as Fibrin stabilizing factor). These fibers form a mesh the traps platelets, blood cells and plasma to form a clot. The removal of the clot is caused by plasmin cleavage of the fibrin monomers into soluble fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is formed by the cleavage of plasminogen between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin is a two-chain trypsin-like serine protease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibit cleavage of plasminogen by",
  "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting foreign DNA from invading microbes or host cells and generating innate immune responses. DAI is the first identified sensor of cytosolic DNA which activates the IRF and NF- {kappa} B transcription factors, leading to production of type I interferon and other cytokines. The second type of cytoplasmic DNA sensor is AIM2. Upon sensing DNA, AIM2 triggers the assembly of the inflammasome, culminating in interleukin maturation. In addition to these receptors, there is a mechanism to sense foreign DNA, with the host RNA polymerase III converting the DNA into RNA for recognition by the RNA sensor RIG-I. These pathways provide various means to alert the cell.",
  "Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cell surface receptors like FAS, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis. The caspases convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death domain like FAS. The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets. Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis have been suggested.",
  "Eph kinases are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular domain that binds their ligand, the ephrins, and an intracellular kinase domain. The ephrins are also expressed on the cell surface, so that interaction between Eph kinases and ephrins occurs at the interface between neighboring cells. Binding of ephrins to Eph kinases stimulates signaling in both directions across the interface between cells, in both the receptor expressing and the ligand expressing cells. Eph kinases and ephrins are involved in several biological processes, and their role in neuronal development has been extensively examined. Both Eph kinases (EphA4 and EphB1) and ephrins (ephrinB1) are expressed on platelets, suggesting activation of eph kinases by ephrins may play a role in clotting when platelets are brought into close proximity in the developing clot. Platelet activation progresses in stages with an early stage that is stimulated by soluble factors like ADP acting through GPCRs and is reversible and later stages with stronger interaction between platelets that may require interact between Eph kinases and ephrins. One of the molecular targets of signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins is the actin cytoskeleton, which also plays a role in",
  "Her2 or ERBB2 belongs to a class of proteins having high homology with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ERBB1). It encodes a protein with the molecular weight of 185 KDa. Unlike other members of EGFR family, no ligand for Her2 has been found and it usually associates with members of ERBB1 family to form functional heterodimers. It has been shown that it can form dimers with ERBB (EGFR), ERBB3 and ERBB4 as well as gp130 subunits of IL-6 receptor. In at least some cell types, the association between gp130 and HRBB2 is essential for HRBB2-ERBB3 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP kinase signaling. Although ERBB1 can form homodimers, the signaling for ERBB1 is usually transient and the receptor undergoes internalization after ligand binding and activation. EGFR-HER2 complex increases the signaling capacity of EGFR by increasing the ligand affinity as well as the recycling of the heterodimer. Of all the ERBB heterodimers, ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimers perhaps elicit the strongest signal. Removing ERBB3 from the cell has a drastic effect on ERBB2 mediated signaling and downstream effectors.

  "Gap junctions contain intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytosolic compartments of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two 'hemichannels', each containing six connexins, contributed by each neighboring cell. These channels permit the direct transfer of small molecules including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers and other metabolites between adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for many physiological events, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Communication through Gap Junction is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2 +, pH, transjunctional applied voltage and phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes. This figure represents the possible activation routes of different protein kinases involved in Cx43 and Cx36 phosphorylation.",
  "Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor / X receptor (SXR / PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and",
  "Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps known as G1 and G2 phases. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated. Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage, the checkpoint kinase ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2, which in turn directly phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. p5",
  "HIV infection is associated with immunosuppression caused by a dramatic reduction in the helper T cell population. The loss of helper T cells may be caused by HIV-induced apoptosis of both infected and uninfected helper T cells. HIV uses the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor for macrophage cell entry and upregulates fas-ligand on these cells. CD4 on helper T cells is essential for viral cell entry and infection. Cross-linking of CD4 on the T cell surface may be involved in upregulation of Fas and sensitization of T cells to apoptosis induced by the Fas / Fas-ligand interaction.",
  "Two major virulence factors of H. pylori are the vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and the cag type-IV secretion system (T4SS) and its translocated effector protein, cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA). VacA binds to lipid rafts and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) of the target cell membrane. After insertion into the plasma membrane, VacA channels are endocytosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartments, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancement of the electrogenic vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) proton pump. In the presence of weak bases, osmotically active acidotropic ions will accumulate in the endosomes. This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, an essential step in vacuole formation. In addition, it is reported that the VacA cleavage product binds to the tyrosine phosphatase receptor zeta (Ptprz) on epithelial cells and the induced signaling leads to the phosphorylation of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1 (Git1) and induces ulcerogenesis in mice. The other virulence factor cag T4SS mediates the translocation of the effector protein CagA, which is subsequently phosphorylated by a Src kinase.",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells serving as the cell's main digestive compartment to which all sorts of macromolecules are delivered for degradation. They contain more than 40 hydrolases in an acidic environment (pH of about 5). After synthesis in the ER, lysosomal enzymes are decorated with mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network. They are packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to late endosomes. Substances for digestion are acquired by the lysosomes via a series of processes including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that provokes a broad range of cellular and physiological responses. In addition to playing a role in inflammation and hematopoiesis, IL-6 is involved in other processes such as neuronal differentiation and bone loss. To produce these effects IL-6 signals through a receptor composed of two different subunits, an alpha subunit that produces ligand specificity and gp130, a receptor subunit shared in common with other cytokines in the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. Activated JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT3, that move into the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing STAT3 response elements. The ras-mediated pathway, acting through Shc, Grb-2 and Sos-1 upstream and activating Map kinases downstream, activates transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-IL-6 (C / EBP-beta) that can act through their own cognate response elements in the genome. These factors and other transcription factors like AP-1 and SRF (",
  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. During step 1, the conditioning regimen (irradiation and / or chemotherapy) leads to damage, activation of host tissues and induction of inflammatory cytokines secretion. Increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and adhesion molecules leads to enhancement of the recognition of host MHC and / or minor histocompatibility antigens by mature donor T cells. Donor T-cell activation in step II is characterized by the predominance of Th1 cells and the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. These cytokines induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which leaks through the intestinal mucosa that was damaged during step 1, together with IFN-gamma, from step 2, further stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines and NO. During step 3, the effector",
  "Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that can lead to development of Th2 cells. The 140 kD IL-4 Receptor (CD124) is found on many cell types, even those of non-hematopoietic origen. The receptor is formed from two chains: IL-4R (alpha) and the IL-2R gamma chain (CD132). Primary signaling is through the JAK / Stat6 pathway and MAPKs.",
  "Blood coagulation or clotting takes place in 3 essential phases. The first phase is the activation of a prothrombin activator complex. The second phase is the activation of prothrombin. The third stage is clot formation as a result of fibrinogen cleavage by activated thrombin. The prothrombin activation complex is formed by two pathways each of which results in a different form of the prothrombin activator. The extrinsic mechanism of prothrombin activator formation begins with trauma to vascular walls or extravascular tissues. The damaged tissue releases tissue thromboplastin also known as tissue factor (TF). The formation of a clot by this mechanism usually takes as little as 15 seconds. This cascade is initiated by the activation of factor X by TF and factor VII. Activated factor X combined with factor V, factor VII and TF constitutes the prothrombin activator. Calcium (Ca + +) is required for each of these steps. The prothrombin activator in the extrinsic pathway is very similar to the activator in the intrinsic pathway. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin and also the step leading to the activation of factor X. Antithrombin III is a hundred to a thousand times more effective when bound by heparin.
