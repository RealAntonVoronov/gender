  "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved structures on pathogens and are involved in the recognition of microbial pathogens and in the induction of innate immune responses. So far, 1 3TLR members have been identified in mammals and TLR1-TLR1 3 are encoded in the human genome. TLR1-TLR6 and TLR1 0 are expressed on the cell surface, while TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed in intracellular compartments such as the plasma membrane and the endosome. TLR2 forms heterodimers with either TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize triacyl or diacyl lipopeptides derived from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacteria. TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 are localized in intracellular compartments and recognize nucleic acids derived from viruses or bacteria. TLR4 is also activated by the endogenous ligands, heat shock proteins and high-mobility group box 1 protein. Upon ligand recognition, TLRs recruit the adaptor proteins to transduce signals. MyD8 8 is the common adaptor protein for all TLRs except for TLR3. TRIF is the adaptor protein for TLR3 and TLR4. RIP1 and TRAF6 are also involved in the signaling of MyD8 8-dependent TLRs. TRIF is the adaptor protein for TLR3 and TLR4.",
  "Endocytosis is a key mechanism for regulating the abundance of cell-surface proteins and lipids. Endocytosis can be constitutive or ligand-induced. Constitutive endocytosis occurs when proteins are delivered to the cell surface directly from the biosynthetic pathway or via recycling endosomes. Ligand-induced endocytosis is initiated by ligand binding to its receptor and the formation of clathrin-coated pits. The receptor-ligand complex is then internalized via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) or clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). CDE is mediated by lipid rafts, caveolae, or clathrin-independent mechanisms. The majority of internalized receptors are either recycled back to the cell surface or sorted to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation.",
  "The calcium-release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), also known as the ryanodine receptor (RyR), is a large homotetrameric protein complex that is expressed in the junctional membrane of the SR (JSR). Each RyR channel is a macromolecular complex composed of four subunits, each of which has a 60-kDa pore-forming subunit and a regulatory or channel-associated subunit. The primary regulator of the RyR channel is the calcium-release channel modulator (or calsequestrin), which binds 4 mol of Ca2 + per mol of calsequestrin. The release of Ca2 + from the SR is triggered by the binding of Ca2 + to the RyR channel, which results in a conformational change of the channel and its subsequent opening. The Ca2 + that is released from the SR is transported to the myofilaments by the Ca2 + -ATPase of the SR (SERCA), which is also a homotetrameric protein complex. The SERCA pump is regulated by phospholamban, which binds to each of the SERCA subunits. The Ca2 + that is transported back into the SR is pumped back into the lumen by the uphill transport of protons by the mitochondrial Ca2 + -ATPase (or F1F0-ATPase).",
  "IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8. IL-10 also induces the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA. The IL-10 receptor is a heterodimer of IL-10R1 and IL-10R2. The IL-10R1 subunit is shared with the IL-6 receptor and is responsible for ligand binding and signal transduction. The IL-10R2 subunit is required for ligand binding and receptor internalization but is not required for signal transduction. The IL-10R1 subunit is also found in the IL-6 receptor and is responsible for the specificity of the IL-10 and IL-6 receptors. Binding of IL-10 to the IL-10R1 / IL-10R2 receptor complex activates the JAK / STAT pathway and induces the expression of anti-inflammatory genes such as heme oxygenase-1. The anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 make it an attractive therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.",
  "The cell cycle is a series of events that a cell goes through in order to prepare for and prosecute its duplication and division. The cell cycle is divided into four phases: G1, S, G2 and M. The G1 phase is the gap phase between the synthesis (S) and duplication (M) phases. The G1 to S phase transition is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDKs are a family of serine / threonine kinases that are activated by association with cyclins. The CDKs are activated by the removal of inhibitory phosphorylation and the addition of a phosphate group by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). The CDKs in turn phosphorylate targets that regulate the cell cycle. The G1 to S phase transition is regulated by the phosphorylation of the RB protein by the cyclin D-CDK4 / 6 kinases. The phosphorylation of RB causes the release of the E2F transcription factor, which activates the transcription of genes required for S phase. The activation of the cyclin E-CDK2 kinase at the G1 to S phase transition further phosphorylates RB, and other targets, that are required for the progression through S phase and into G2. The G2 to M phase transition is regulated by the activation of the cyclin B-CDK1 kinase. The activity of the cyclin B-CDK1 kinase is regulated by the destruction of cyclin B and the phosphorylation of CDK1 by the Wee1 and Myt1 kinases. The completion of DNA replication in S phase triggers the activation of the G2 to M phase transition by the activation of the cyclin A-CDK1 kinase. The activation of the cyclin B-CDK1 kinase at the G2 to M phase transition is inhibited by the protein kinase Myt1. The completion of mitosis triggers the destruction of cyclin B by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), and the inactivation of the cyclin A-CDK1 kinase by the phosphatase Cdc2 5C. The completion of mitosis is signaled by the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which inhibits the cyclin B-CDK1 kinase and the APC until all of the chromosomes are properly aligned on the metaphase plate. The spindle assembly checkpoint inhibits the APC to prevent the destruction of cyclin B and the activation of the cyclin A-CDK1 kinase until all of the chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate. The activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint also inhibits the APC to prevent the destruction of cyclin B and the activation of the cyclin A-CDK1 kinase until all of the chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate.",
  "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, with a wide range of clinical outcomes. Some patients are cured with current therapies, while others have a poor prognosis. The molecular basis of AML is complex and heterogeneous, with a large number of genetic alterations identified to date. Some of these alterations are associated with favorable prognosis, such as the t (8; 2 1) translocation, which generates the AML1-ETO fusion protein. Other alterations are associated with a poor prognosis, such as the inv, which generates the CBFB-MYH1 1 fusion protein. The t (9; 2 2) translocation, which generates the BCR-ABL fusion protein, is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms by which these fusion proteins contribute to leukemogenesis are not yet clear.",
  "Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and is associated with increased angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. The transcription factor HIF-1 is a key mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate HIF-1 on two conserved prolyl residues. This leads to the binding of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, and subsequent degradation of HIF-1 by the proteasome. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 is stabilized and activates the transcription of genes involved in many aspects of tumor progression, including angiogenesis, glycolysis, erythropoiesis, and cell survival. Another oxygen-sensitive factor is the ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 4EBP-1, which is phosphorylated by the mTOR kinase under hypoxic conditions, leading to the dissociation of eIF-4E and eIF-4G and the activation of protein translation.",
  "The immune system consists of a variety of cells that respond to different stimuli. Macrophages, B cells, and T cells are all involved in the immune response. Macrophages are the cells of the innate immune system that respond to non-specific stimuli like bacterial products like LPS. B cells produce antibodies that are specific for a particular antigen. T cells are the cells of the adaptive immune system that respond to specific antigens and provide a more long-lasting response. Macrophages and B cells respond to bacterial stimuli by producing cytokines that stimulate other immune cells. Macrophages also present antigen to T cells in the adaptive immune response. B cells produce antibodies that bind specific antigens and are transported to the B cell receptor (BCR) on the surface of T cells. The BCR binds antigen and the T cell receptor (TCR) binds to the MHC protein associated with the antigen. The interaction of the BCR and TCR activates T cells and stimulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Macrophages and T cells also communicate with each other through cytokines. Macrophages produce cytokines that stimulate T cell proliferation and activation. T cells produce cytokines that stimulate macrophage activation and proliferation.",
  "Homologous recombination (HR) is a mechanism for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). HR is initiated by the resection of DNA ends to generate 3 'single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. The 3' ssDNA tails are first coated by the ssDNA-binding protein RPA, which is then replaced by the recombinase Rad5 1. The Rad5 1-ssDNA filament then searches for a homologous sequence and searches for and invades a homologous duplex, forming a joint molecule with the single-stranded DNA, followed by DNA synthesis and then DNA ligation. The Holliday junction is an intermediate of HR and can be resolved by either of two different pathways, by structure-specific endonucleases or by DNA helicases and topoisomerases.",
  "The transcription factor NF-kB is a key regulator of genes involved in the immune response, apoptosis, and cellular transformation. Normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by an inhibitor protein, IkB, activation of NF-kB occurs through phosphorylation of IkB, its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation in the proteosome. The kinase that phosphorylates IkB is activated by a variety of stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and viral infection. Once phosphorylated, IkB is ubiquitinated and degraded, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and bind to DNA and activate transcription. The kinase that phosphorylates IkB is NIK (NF-kB-inducing kinase), a member of the map kinase family. The NIK gene was identified as a potential oncogene in a study of a chromosomal translocation found in a subset of Hodgkin's lymphomas. The translocation fuses the NIK gene to the Ig heavy-chain locus, resulting in constitutive expression of NIK. The kinase activity of NIK is required for NF-kB activation, as a kinase-inactive mutant of NIK does not activate NF-kB. The kinase activity of NIK is also required for activation of the transcription factor ATF2, another substrate of NIK. The map kinase kinase MEKK1 also activates NF-kB, but MEKK1 does not activate NIK, indicating that MEKK1 and NIK act in parallel pathways to activate NF-kB. The p53 tumor suppressor gene also activates NF-kB, but does so through a p53-dependent pathway that does not involve NF-kB activation.",
  "The innate immune response is triggered by the presence of microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the extracellular environment. The LPS receptor is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) gene family. The TLR family is found in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. In the innate immune system, TLR signaling activates the expression of cytokines and other genes that stimulate the inflammatory response. In adaptive immunity, TLR signaling stimulates the activation and proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes. In addition to the TLR family, the innate immune system contains a variety of intracellular signaling molecules, including the adaptor protein MyD8 8, the kinase IRAK, and the transcription factor NF-kB. The activation of innate immunity by LPS is a complex process. LPS is a complex molecule, consisting of a lipid A portion that is responsible for the toxicity of the molecule, and a core oligosaccharide portion that is required for the biological activity of the molecule. The lipid A portion of LPS interacts with the TLR4 / MD2 receptor complex, activating signaling through the MyD8 8-dependent pathway. The core oligosaccharide portion of LPS interacts with the TLR4 / MD2 receptor complex, activating signaling through the MyD8 8-independent pathway. The activation of innate immunity by LPS is a key component of the response to infection by Gram-negative bacteria. The activation of innate immunity by LPS also has important therapeutic implications. The inappropriate activation of innate immunity by LPS can lead to septic shock, a condition involving multiple organ failure and death that is associated with the inappropriate activation of the innate immune system. The inappropriate activation of innate immunity by LPS may also play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma and other inflammatory conditions.",
  "The complement system is a major component of the humoral immune response. It is activated by three different pathways, the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. The first two pathways are triggered by antibody-antigen complexes or by interaction with microbial carbohydrates, respectively. The alternative pathway is initiated spontaneously by C3 convertase formation. The three initiating pathways converge in the formation of C3 convertase, which cleaves the third complement component (C3) into C3a and C3b. The opsonin C3b is involved in phagocytosis of the infectious agent and in the formation of the C5 convertase. The C5 convertase cleaves C5 into the anaphylatoxin C5a and C5b. C5b associates with C6, C7, and C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC causes osmotic lysis of cells that are not protected by CD5 9. The anaphylatoxin C5a is involved in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. C5b-9 induces the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and stimulates the release of vasoactive mediators from these cells.",
  "The liver is the major site of heme synthesis and degradation. Heme is an essential cofactor for many proteins, but it is also toxic in excess. Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in heme degradation, converting heme to carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, and the by-product biliverdin. HO-1 is an inducible stress protein that is induced by a variety of stimuli including heme, metals, oxidative stress, and cytokines. HO-1 expression is also induced by the transcription factor Nrf2. HO-1 induction results in the production of CO, which has been implicated in the regulation of vascular tone, inflammation, and apoptosis. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. The antioxidant properties of bilirubin have been proposed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties of HO-1. The production of free iron by HO-1 is also important in iron homeostasis. The release of iron from heme can be utilized by the body to synthesize heme and also stored in ferritin. In addition to its role in heme metabolism, HO-1 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, and angiogenesis.",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins plays a key role in development of many different tissues and organs. In the developing central nervous system, Hh signaling is required for the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells and for the survival of neurons. Hh signaling also plays a key role in the development of the skin, regulating the proliferation of epidermal cells. Mutations in components of the Hh signaling pathway have been associated with several types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma of the skin, and some forms of lung, pancreatic, and colon cancer. Hh signaling is mediated by the transcription factors Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3. In the absence of Hh ligand, the Patched (Ptc) protein inhibits the activity of the signaling pathway by an as yet unknown mechanism. Binding of Hh to Ptc relieves inhibition of the pathway, allowing activation of the pathway by the Gli proteins. Activation of the pathway results in the nuclear translocation of Gli1, which activates transcription of target genes.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly coordinated sequence of events that includes DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Mitosis is the phase of the cell cycle during which the cell's genome is divided into two daughter cells. Mitosis is also the phase during which the cell's chromosomes are condensed. Mitosis is triggered by the activation of a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1), also known as maturation promoting factor (MPF). The activation of MPF is regulated by the cyclin subunit and the phosphorylation state of Cdk1. The activation of MPF triggers the entry into mitosis and the initiation of chromosome condensation. The activation of MPF is opposed by the protein tyrosine phosphatase Cdc2 5. The activation of MPF is also opposed by the protein kinase Wee1. The activation of Wee1 is opposed by the kinase Myt1. The activation of Wee1 and Myt1 is opposed by the protein kinase Chk1. The checkpoint kinase Chk1 is activated by the DNA damage checkpoint. The activation of Chk1 by DNA damage inhibits the activation of MPF by Cdc2 5, Wee1, and Myt1. The DNA replication checkpoint also inhibits the activation of MPF by blocking the activation of Cdc2 5. The DNA replication checkpoint also inhibits the activation of MPF by blocking the degradation of cyclin B. The DNA damage checkpoint inhibits the activation of MPF by blocking the degradation of cyclin B.",
  "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a major pathway for protein degradation in cells. Proteins are tagged with ubiquitin before they are degraded by the proteasome. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins is a multistep process involving three enzymes: a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The specificity of the UPS pathway is determined by the E3 enzymes. The alpha-synuclein protein is a major component of Lewy bodies, the hallmark pathological lesions of Parkinson's disease. The presence of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies suggests that the protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The presence of ubiquitin in Lewy bodies suggests that the UPS may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

The presence of mutations in alpha-synuclein in familial Parkinson's disease further supports this hypothesis. The UPS is a major pathway for protein degradation in cells. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins is a key step in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome. The specificity of the UPS pathway is determined by E3 ubiquitin ligases. The parkin gene is responsible for an autosomal recessive form of early-onset Parkinson's disease. The parkin protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The parkin gene mutations lead to a loss of parkin E3 ligase activity, which may result in an accumulation of abnormal proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, that can form Lewy bodies. The identification of parkin as an E3 ubiquitin ligase further supports the hypothesis that the UPS may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The identification of parkin as an E3 ubiquitin ligase also suggests that parkin-mediated ubiquitination may be involved in the degradation of alpha-synuclein.

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is widely expressed in epithelial tissues and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Overexpression of EGFR has been observed in many human cancers and is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a poor prognosis. Binding of EGF or TGF-alpha to EGFR induces receptor dimerization, activation of the intrinsic protein kinase activity of the receptor, and autophosphorylation of the receptor on specific tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated residues serve as binding sites for proteins containing src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. These downstream signaling molecules include the GRB2-SOS-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and the PI3 kinase-AKT pathway. EGFR activation also leads to the activation of NF-kB through the PI3 kinase-AKT pathway and the p38 kinase pathway. The activation of NF-kB by EGFR contributes to cell survival and anti-apoptosis.",
  "The fibrinolytic system is a proteolytic cascade that degrades fibrin clots and plays a key role in the maintenance of hemostasis. The key components of the fibrinolytic system are the serine proteases tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), their inhibitors (PAIs), and the fibrin clot itself. The fibrinolytic system is activated by the binding of tPA and uPA to fibrin clots, releasing the catalytic serine proteases, tPA and uPA, from their respective proenzyme forms. The tPA-plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) complex is the most active fibrinolytic complex, and is responsible for the degradation of fibrin clots. The uPA-plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) complex is less active than the tPA-PAI1 complex, but is also involved in the degradation of fibrin clots. The balance between the activators and inhibitors of the fibrinolytic system is critical for the proper functioning of the fibrinolytic system. Deficiencies in the components of the fibrinolytic system can lead to excessive fibrin formation and the formation of thrombi, which can result in heart attacks and strokes. The fibrinolytic system is also involved in other processes, including the migration of cells, the release of growth factors, and the activation of complement. The components of the fibrinolytic system are found in a variety of tissues and cells, including the lungs, kidneys, brain, and heart. The tPA and uPA genes are located on different chromosomes and are regulated by different mechanisms. The tPA gene is regulated by the binding of the transcription factor Egr-1 to the tPA promoter. The uPA gene is regulated by the transcription factors AP-1 and PEA3. The PAIs are a family of proteins that bind to and inhibit tPA and uPA. The PAIs are regulated by the protease plasmin, which cleaves and inactivates tPA and uPA. The PAIs are also regulated by the protease inhibitor PAI-2. The formation of a fibrin clot is initiated by the activation of the clotting factors thrombin and factor XII. The clot is then degraded by the fibrinolytic system, activated by the binding of tPA and uPA to fibrin clots. The components of the fibrinolytic system are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of thrombosis and other conditions involving excessive fibrin formation.",
  "Taste perception is triggered by the detection of a wide variety of compounds by taste receptors. These receptors are localized in the taste bud cells and are grouped into five classes: the bitter, sweet, umami, amino acid and salt receptors. Bitter, sweet and umami compounds are detected by specific receptors, the T2Rs, T1Rs and mGluRs, respectively. Bitter and sweet compounds are detected by two distinct families of GPCRs, the T1R and T2R families, respectively. The T1Rs and T2Rs form heterodimers that are activated by tastants. The umami receptor is a heterodimer formed by T1Rs and a metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR4. The amino acid receptor is a heterodimer formed by a cationic amino acid transporter and a vomeronasal receptor, V1R. Salty compounds are detected by a heterodimer formed by a sodium channel and a TRP channel, such as TRPM5. Food compounds such as lipids, proteins and nucleotides are detected by a variety of mechanisms.",
  "T cell activation is initiated by the interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with antigen-bound MHC on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC). This interaction leads to the activation of the T cell receptor complex (TCR) -associated protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn, which phosphorylate several proteins in the TCR complex, including the CD3 subunits. The phosphorylation of the TCR complex creates binding sites for other proteins, including the adaptor protein LAT. LAT also becomes phosphorylated, creating binding sites for other signaling proteins. One of the first events following TCR engagement is the activation of the small G-protein Ras. Ras activates a kinase cascade that includes the kinases Raf, Mek and Erk, which ultimately leads to the activation of transcription factors such as NFAT and AP-1. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins also plays an important role in T cell activation. The activation of PKC is dependent on the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), which is produced by the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C (PLC). DAG activates the kinase PKC, which in turn activates the transcription factor NF-AT. DAG also activates the kinase Raf, which activates the kinase Mek, which activates Erk. The activation of PKC and the kinase cascade downstream of Ras are all dependent on the presence of calcium. The activation of NF-AT and AP-1 by the Ras pathway and the activation of NF-kB by the PKC pathway are important for the activation of T cells. The activation of T cells is also regulated by the phosphatase calcineurin, which is activated by calcium and dephosphorylates NFAT and other transcription factors.",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to infection, but chronic inflammation can damage tissues. The first step in inflammation is the activation of the complement system, a cascade of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of foreign cells or foreign molecules. The activated complement proteins recruit and activate leukocytes to the site of inflammation, causing the release of inflammatory factors that help clear the infection. The activated complement proteins also cause lysis of the cells that activate the complement system, helping to remove infected or damaged cells. The membrane attack complex (MAC) formed by the complement system causes lysis of cells and is a part of the immune system that kills bacteria. The membrane attack complex also causes lysis of red blood cells, leading to anemia. The activated complement proteins also attract and activate other cells in the immune response, including macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages phagocytose cells that have been killed by the complement system, and release inflammatory factors to help fight infection. Mast cells release inflammatory factors in response to the complement system, and are involved in allergic reactions. Macrophages and mast cells also express adhesion molecules that help recruit other cells to the site of inflammation. Adhesion molecules on the surface of cells bind to receptors on other cells, helping to keep cells in the proper location and facilitating communication between cells. The complement system, macrophages, and mast cells all play an important role in the immune response, but can also cause inflammation in response to infection when they are activated inappropriately.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multi-subunit complex that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for the recognition of specific peptide antigens in the context of MHC molecules. The TCR is composed of six different polypeptide chains, alpha and beta chains that form the variable region of the receptor, and three chains, gamma, delta, and epsilon that form the constant region. The TCR complex is associated with a multi-subunit complex of proteins that includes the CD3 subunits and the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors. The CD3 subunits are responsible for the association of the TCR with the signaling machinery in the T cell. The activation of the T cell is initiated by the binding of the TCR to peptide-MHC complex on an antigen-presenting cell. This binding causes a conformational change in the TCR complex that leads to the activation of the T cell. The activation of the T cell is accompanied by the activation of a number of different signaling pathways that lead to T cell activation.",
  "The insulin receptor is a key component of the insulin signaling pathway. The binding of insulin to the receptor leads to the activation of the Ras / Raf / MAPK pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway. The Ras / Raf / MAPK pathway leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as ELK-1 and p38, resulting in the activation of genes such as c-fos and c-jun. The PI 3-kinase pathway leads to the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3, and the activation of transcription factors such as c-myc and FKHRL1. The activation of these transcription factors leads to the regulation of genes involved in metabolism, growth and differentiation.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved signal transduction module that is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, motility, survival and apoptosis. The MAPK cascade is typically organized into kinase cascades, in which a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and thereby activates a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn phosphorylates and thereby activates a MAPK. The MAPKs are Erk1 / 2, JNK, and p38. Each of these MAPKs is activated by a different MAPKK, and each MAPKK is activated by a different MAPKKK. The MAPKKKs include the Raf, Mek, and p38 kinases. The upstream activators of the MAPKKKs are the growth factor receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors, and cytokines. The activation of the MAPK cascade is initiated by the binding of a growth factor to its receptor, followed by the activation of Ras. The activation of Ras leads to the recruitment of the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2, which together with the exchange factor Sos-1 activate the Mek1 / 2-Erk1 / 2 cascade. The activation of the p38 cascade is initiated by the cytokines, followed by the activation of the NF-kB pathway.",
  "Splicing is a key step in gene expression that removes introns from precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) and ligates the exons to form a mature mRNA that can be translated into a protein. Splicing takes place in a macromolecular complex called the spliceosome, which consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, and many other proteins. Spliceosomes assemble on the conserved sequences at the 5 'and 3' splice sites and the branch point, a highly conserved sequence of introns, in a stepwise manner. The first step of splicing, termed the recognition of the splice sites, is a dynamic process that involves the exchange of some proteins for other ones. After recognition, the spliceosome is activated and the spliceosome is converted to the first catalytic step. The second step of splicing involves the ligation of exons and the release of the intron lariat.",
  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). GVHD is caused by the attack of donor T cells on host tissues. In addition to the direct attack of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) on host cells, cytokines produced by activated T cells are also involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD. The interaction of donor T cells with host cells leads to the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the expression of cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1. These cytokines can induce apoptosis in host cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of GVHD.",
  "Hypertrophy is a complex pathological growth of the heart that can lead to heart failure. Cardiac hypertrophy is induced by various stimuli, including pressure overload, volume overload, and genetic defects. Cardiac hypertrophy is initially an adaptive response to increased hemodynamic load, in which the heart enlarges in an attempt to normalize wall stress and maintain cardiac function. However, prolonged cardiac hypertrophy is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is associated with an increased risk of heart failure and sudden death. Cardiac hypertrophy is initially characterized by an increase in the size of cardiomyocytes without an increase in their number. This is followed by re-expression of fetal genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), which are normally expressed only in fetal hearts. The fetal gene program is associated with a decrease in the expression of contractile proteins, such as myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin, and an increase in the expression of natriuretic peptides, which are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and volume. The reactivation of the fetal gene program is associated with a decrease in the activity of the transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2). The activity of MEF-2 is regulated by various signaling pathways, including the calcineurin / nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) pathway. The calcineurin / NFAT pathway is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Calcineurin is a calcium-activated phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT, leading to its nuclear localization and activation of gene expression. Calcineurin is activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, which is induced by various stimuli, including pressure overload. Calcineurin activation leads to the nuclear localization of NFAT and the subsequent activation of fetal genes. The MAPK pathway is also involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The expression of ANF and beta-MHC is increased by the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p3 8 MAPK. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn activates ERK, JNK, and p3 8 MAPK. Calcineurin also activates MEF-2, which is involved in the reactivation of the fetal gene program. The calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) pathway is also involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. CaMK activates NFAT, which is also activated by calcineurin. The reactivation of the fetal gene program is also involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The inhibition of CaMK by KN6 2 or KN9 3 inhibits the reactivation of the fetal gene program and the development of cardiac hypertrophy.",
  "Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that is produced by activated Th2 cells and is involved in the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells. IL-4 also plays a role in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and the activation of eosinophils. The IL-4 receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor family and is composed of two chains, a ligand-specific alpha chain and a common gamma chain that is shared with other cytokines in the IL-2 family. The alpha chain is required for high affinity binding and is not itself a signaling protein. The gamma chain is also shared by other cytokines in the IL-2 family. Binding of IL-4 to the alpha / gamma receptor complex activates JAK kinases and the STAT proteins, STAT6 being the major STAT activated by IL-4. The JAK / STAT pathway is also activated by other cytokines in the hematopoeitic growth factor family, and the IL-4 receptor is a member of this family. The JAK / STAT pathway is a point of convergence for multiple signaling pathways and is involved in many cellular responses. The JAK / STAT pathway is also involved in the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells. The JAK / STAT pathway is also involved in other cellular responses to IL-4, such as the activation of monocytes and the differentiation of eosinophils. The JAK / STAT pathway is also involved in other cellular responses to cytokines, such as the induction of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-xL. The JAK / STAT pathway is also involved in other cellular responses to cytokines, such as the induction of the acute phase response.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway for the repair of small base lesions in DNA, such as uracil, thymine, 5mUra, 3meA, 8oxoG, and other modified bases. BER is initiated by the excision of the damaged base by a specific DNA glycosylase, followed by incision of the DNA backbone at the resulting apurinic / apyrimidinic (AP) site by an AP endonuclease. In mammalian cells, BER is accomplished by a series of steps. (i) Glycosylase removes the damaged base. (ii) AP endonuclease incises the DNA 5 'to the AP site. (iii) DNA polymerase (pol) fills in the single nucleotide gap, and then (iv) DNA ligase (Lig) seals the remaining nick.",
  "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is the major non-lysosomal proteolytic system in eukaryotes. It is responsible for the degradation of most intracellular proteins, including regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle control, signal transduction, antigen processing, apoptosis, and stress response. The proteasome is a large multiprotein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The proteolytic activity of the proteasome is carried out by three distinct activities: trypsin-like (T-L), chymotrypsin-like (C-L), and peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PGPH). The proteasome is a 26S proteasome in which one or both of the regulatory particles PA70 0 (PA70 0) and PA28 (PA28) are required. PA28 is also called PA300. PA28 binds to PA70 0 and is responsible for the binding of the proteasome to ubiquitinated proteins. PA28 is a ring-shaped structure with a 20S core. PA28 is composed of 20S subunits alpha 10beta 10beta 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111l11111111111111l111111111111l1111l11111111l111111111l11111l11l11l111111l11l111l1l111l1l111l1l111l11l1l1l1l1l11l1l1l11l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily contains several members that induce apoptosis or programmed cell death when activated by their cognate ligands. One of the receptors in this family, TNFR1, can also induce the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 requires the receptor to be in a complex with the adaptor protein TRADD. TRADD interacts with the kinase RIP and also with the kinase NIK. RIP and NIK activate the I-kB kinases, which phosphorylate and thereby activate the NF-kB transcription factors. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 also requires the kinase activity of the receptor. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 requires the receptor to be in a complex with TRADD, but does not require RIP. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 also requires the kinase activity of the receptor. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 requires the receptor to be in a complex with TRADD, but does not require RIP. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 requires the receptor to be in a complex with TRADD, but does not require RIP. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 also requires the kinase activity of the receptor.

  "Granzyme B is a serine protease released from cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells that induces apoptosis in target cells. Granzyme B enters the target cell and is transported to the nucleus, where it cleaves nuclear proteins, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), topoisomerase II, and NuMA. The cleavage of these proteins by granzyme B leads to the nuclear changes associated with apoptosis. The cleavage of DNA-PK and topoisomerase II by granzyme B also activates the DNA-damage response pathway, which may amplify the apoptotic signal. The cleavage of NuMA by granzyme B may be involved in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton that occurs during apoptosis. Granzyme B also activates caspase-3, a protease that is responsible for most of the proteolytic events during apoptosis. Granzyme B activates caspase-3 by cleaving the caspase-3 inhibitor, XIAP. The cleavage of XIAP by granzyme B relieves inhibition of caspase-3, allowing caspase-3 to cleave other cellular targets and induce apoptosis. Granzyme B also activates caspase-independent pathways of apoptosis. The cleavage of the anti-apoptotic protein Bid by granzyme B induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then activates caspase-9 and caspase-3. Granzyme B also activates a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that does not require caspase activation. Granzyme B activates apoptosis by multiple pathways, and the relative importance of each pathway may depend on the cell type and the environment of the cell.",
  "The chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 1 (CCL2 1) is a ligand for the chemokine receptor CCR7. CCR7 is expressed on the surface of immature DCs and mature DCs. CCR7 expression is induced by inflammatory stimuli such as LPS and TNF-alpha. CCL2 1 is expressed in high levels in the secondary lymphoid tissues, including the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. CCL2 1 binds to CCR7 and induces chemotaxis of immature and mature DCs. DCs that have migrated to the secondary lymphoid tissues respond to CCL2 1 by migrating to the T cell zone of the lymph nodes. DCs that have not migrated to the T cell zone of the lymph nodes respond to CCL2 1 by migrating to the B cell zone of the lymph nodes. DCs that have migrated to the B cell zone of the lymph nodes respond to CCL2 1 by migrating to the T cell zone of the lymph nodes. DCs that have migrated to the T cell zone of the lymph nodes respond to CCL2 1 by migrating to the B cell zone of the lymph nodes. DCs that have migrated to the B cell zone of the lymph nodes respond to CCL2 1 by migrating to the T cell zone of the lymph nodes. DCs that have migrated to the T cell zone of the lymph nodes respond to CCL2 1 by migrating to the B cell zone of the lymph nodes. DCs that have not migrated to the lymph nodes respond to CCL2 1 by migrating to the spleen.",
  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a serine / threonine kinase that is activated by the second messenger cAMP. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. The regulatory subunits bind to four molecules of cAMP and are released upon binding of cAMP to the catalytic subunits. The PKA regulatory subunit 100is encoded by the PRKAR1A gene. Loss of function mutations in PRKAR1A lead to the cAMP-independent activation of PKA and the Carney complex, a multiple neoplasia syndrome. The PKA catalytic subunit 110is encoded by the PRKACA gene. Mutations in PRKACA lead to constitutive activation of PKA and are associated with the development of cortisol-secreting adrenal adenomas. The PKA holoenzyme is also regulated by the cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Epac). Epac1 and Epac2 are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Ras-like GTPases Rap-1 and Ral-B. The cAMP-activated exchange factor Epac is encoded by the RAPGEF3 gene. The Rap-1 and Ral-B GTPases are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase is also regulated by the p300 protein kinase. The p300 protein kinase is activated by the phosphorylation of a threonine residue by the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related kinases. The p300 protein kinase is encoded by the gene PRKCZ. The p300protein kinase is also called the casein kinase 2 (CK-2) family of protein kinases. The p30 protein kinase is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis.",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 2 0-kDa guanine nucleotide binding proteins that are members of the Ras GTPase superfamily. ARFs are essential for the activation of cholera toxin and are involved in the intracellular vesicle trafficking. There are at least four ARF genes in mammals, and they are grouped into three classes based on their sequence similarities. Class I ARFs (ARF1, ARF2, and ARF3) are 2 0-kDa proteins that are highly conserved in sequence and structure. Class II ARFs (ARF4 and ARF5) are 2 1-kDa proteins that are 8 5% identical in amino acid sequence. ARF4 and ARF5 are closely related and are not clearly distinguished in this study. ARF6 is a 2 6-kDa protein that is most similar in sequence to ARF3. ARFs cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. The inactive form is found in the cytosol and is associated with the Golgi complex. Activation of ARF requires a specific nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which catalyzes the release of bound GDP and the binding of a new GTP molecule. The intrinsic GTPase activity of ARF is very low, but stimulated by GAPs, which stimulate the low intrinsic GTPase activity of ARF. GAPs are a diverse group of proteins that share a conserved ~ 13 0 amino acid domain, the GAP domain. GAPs stimulate the GTPase activity of ARF proteins by several orders of magnitude and are critical for the regulation of ARF activity. GAPs also stimulate the intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity of ARFs. The GAPs for ARFs include GcA1, GcA2, and Glo3 in yeast, and ASAP1, ASAP2, ASAP3, and GIT2 in mammals. GAPs also include GIT2-related proteins, which lack the ARF GAP domain, and ASAP-related proteins, which contain the ARF GAP domain. The GAPs for ARFs are classified into two groups based on their sequence similarities and functions. The first group includes GcA1, GcA2, and Glo3, which are essential for yeast cell growth. The second group includes ASAP1, ASAP2, and GIT2. ASAP proteins are expressed in a variety of tissues and are localized to focal adhesions, actin cytoskeleton, and endosomes. ASAP proteins bind to paxillin and Crk and are involved in cell migration and cytoskeletal reorganization.",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia. AD is characterized by the presence of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). SPs are composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, which are derived from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. The pathogenesis of AD is believed to be closely associated with the accumulation of Abeta peptides and tau pathology. Recent studies suggest that Abeta may exert its toxicity through a variety of mechanisms, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and calcium homeostasis disruption.",
  "Chemokine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that bind chemokines and activate signaling pathways to direct cell migration. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 are expressed on lymphocytes and are activated by their ligands, SDF-1 and CCL2 1, to direct lymphocyte homing and trafficking. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 are also expressed on some cancer cells and are activated by their ligands to direct cancer cell migration and metastasis. The activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by its ligand SDF-1 activates a signaling pathway that includes the Gi protein, the small G protein Rac, the serine-threonine kinase AKT, and the transcription factor NF-kB. The chemokine receptor CCR7 also activates Rac and AKT, but does not activate NF-kB. The chemokine receptor CCR7 also activates the MAPK pathway, including activation of the kinases MEKK1, MEK1, and ERK2. The chemokine receptor CCR7 also activates the phospholipase C pathway, leading to calcium flux and activation of protein kinase C. The chemokine receptor CCR7 also activates the focal adhesion kinase, FAK, and paxillin, and the actin cytoskeleton is reorganized to direct cell migration. The activation of CCR7 also activates the kinase Src, which may contribute to CCR7 signaling. The signaling pathways activated by CCR7 are similar to those activated by the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and may contribute to cancer metastasis.",
  "The formation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is a multistep process. Axons of motor neurons contact skeletal muscle cells and release agrin, a large proteoglycan, which binds to the dystroglycan complex on the muscle cell surface. Agrin induces clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), the key component of the postsynaptic apparatus at the NMJ. Agrin also induces clustering of utrophin, a dystrophin-related protein. Clustering of AChRs and utrophin is mediated by the intracellular protein rapsyn. Agrin-induced clustering of AChRs is also dependent on muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the neurotrophin erb-b2. Clustering of AChRs by agrin is followed by the formation of the secondary synaptic folds, which are thought to increase the surface area for the neuromuscular transmission. Agrin is also involved in the maintenance of NMJs. Disruption of the agrin gene in mice results in the absence of NMJs at birth and death within a few days after birth. Agrin is also involved in the formation of synapses between neurons and non-skeletal muscle cells.",
  "The kallikrein-kinin system is a hormonal cascade that includes plasma kallikrein, tissue kallikrein, and bradykinin. Kinin peptides are released from kininogen precursors by plasma kallikrein or tissue kallikrein. Tissue kallikrein is released from kininogen by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator and is involved in inflammatory responses. Kinin peptides also stimulate cardiac contractility and renal function. Kinin peptides are released during tissue injury and inflammation. Tissue kallikrein is overexpressed in prostate cancer and is a prognostic indicator of disease recurrence. The mitogenic activity of tissue kallikrein is mediated by the protease-activated EGF receptor (EGFR). Tissue kallikrein also activates PAR-2, a G-protein coupled receptor. PAR-2 activation stimulates proliferation of prostate cancer cells and PAR-2 activation also stimulates the release of the angiogenic factor VEGF. PAR-2 activation also stimulates the release of the neuropeptide substance P, which may contribute to the pain associated with prostate cancer. The mitogenic and angiogenic activities of tissue kallikrein are mediated by the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the transcription factor ELK-1. Kinin peptides also activate PAR-2 to stimulate calcium release and activate protein kinase C. The mitogenic activity of tissue kallikrein is blocked by the protease inhibitors aprotinin and alpha-2-antiplasmin. The mitogenic activity of tissue kallikrein is also blocked by the protease inhibitor alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. The kallikrein-kinin system may play a role in the development of prostate cancer. The kallikrein-kinin system may also play a role in the development of pain associated with prostate cancer.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multi-subunit complex that is expressed on the surface of T cells and plays a critical role in the recognition of foreign antigens by the T cell. The TCR is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha and beta chain that noncovalently associate with the heterodimer to form the TCR complex. The zeta chain is a component of the TCR that is expressed in low copy number and is required for efficient surface expression of the TCR. The CD3 complex is associated with the zeta chain and is required for the efficient expression of the TCR. The CD3 complex is associated with several other proteins that play a role in the function of the TCR complex. The p21 protein is associated with the TCR and plays a role in the phosphorylation of the TCR and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The zeta chain is associated with the SH2 domain of ZAP-7 0, a protein tyrosine kinase that is activated by phosphorylation by the TCR and that plays a critical role in the initiation of TCR signaling. The CD24 protein is associated with beta1 and beta2 chains of the TCR and plays a role in the regulation of the TCR. The CD3 complex is also associated with several other proteins that play a role in the function of the TCR. The LAT protein is phosphorylated following TCR ligation and plays a role in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The SLP-7 6 protein is also phosphorylated following TCR ligation and plays a role in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The CD4 and CD8 proteins are associated with the TCR complex and play a role in the regulation of the TCR.",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mechanism for the recognition and removal of bulky, helix-distorting lesions, including those caused by UV light, bulky chemical adducts, and cross-links. NER is a multistep process that involves more than 3 0 polypeptides and three distinct pathways of repair: transcription-coupled repair (TCR), global genome repair (GGR), and an NER-independent pathway for the repair of ICLs. In GGR, the XPC-HR2 3B-UV-DDB complex detects DNA damage, recruiting the basal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and XPE to the site of damage. The XPB and XPD helicases in TFIIH unwind the damaged DNA, recruiting the XPG and ERCC1-XPF endonucleases. The resulting single-stranded region is repaired by DNA replication and ligation.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is a multi-subunit complex that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for the recognition of specific antigen bound to the MHC-II molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The TCR complex is composed of six different polypeptide chains, two each from the alpha and beta chains, and two each from the gamma and delta chains. The CD3 complex is associated with the TCR complex and is responsible for signal transduction following antigen recognition. The zeta chain is associated with the TCR complex and is responsible for the signal transduction function of the TCR complex. The zeta chain contains three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that are phosphorylated by the protein tyrosine kinase Lck. The Lck-dependent phosphorylation of the ITAMs in the zeta chain leads to the recruitment of additional Lck and other signaling molecules to the TCR complex and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The activation of Lck is positively regulated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD4 5 and negatively regulated by the Csk kinase. The Csk kinase phosphorylates Lck on a conserved tyrosine residue in the kinase domain (Y3 9 4 in human Lck) that is inhibitory to Lck activity. The Csk gene is localized to the same region of chromosome 1 as the gene for the Src family member Fyn, suggesting that Csk may regulate Fyn as well. The Csk kinase is regulated by the binding of Csk to the phosphoprotein adaptor 14@-@ 3-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The Csk-14@-@ 3-3 interaction is regulated by the kinase PKA, which phosphorylates Csk on a serine residue (S2 9 in human Csk). The Csk-14@-@ 3-3 interaction is also regulated by the tyrosine kinase Lck, which phosphorylates Csk on a tyrosine residue (Y5 0 5 in human Csk). The phosphorylation of Csk by Lck dissociates Csk from 14@-@ 3-3, activating Csk and dephosphorylating Lck. The Csk-dependent regulation of Lck activity may be involved in the regulation of T cell activation.",
  "The FPR is a G-protein coupled receptor that is activated by peptides derived from bacterial proteins known as formylated peptides. The FPR is expressed by neutrophils and is involved in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. The FPR is also expressed by microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. Activation of the FPR in microglia leads to the release of reactive oxygen species and the release of cytokines that may contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The FPR is also expressed by some types of tumor cells and may contribute to their proliferation. The FPR is coupled to multiple G-proteins and signaling pathways. The FPR couples to Gi, Gq, and G1 2 / 1 3 to activate different signaling pathways. Gi activates the MAP kinase pathway and inhibits adenylyl cyclase. Gq activates phospholipase C and the release of calcium. G1 2 / 1 3 activates Rho and the MAP kinase pathway. The FPR also couples to Gs, activating adenylyl cyclase and increasing cAMP levels. The FPR is phosphorylated by GRKs and binds arrestins, targeting it for internalization. The FPR is also regulated by protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates the FPR and desensitizes the receptor, while protein phosphatase 1Deg dephosphorylates FPR and resensitizes the receptor.",
  "The MET receptor tyrosine kinase is a cell surface receptor for hepatocyte growth factor / scatter factor (HGF / SF). HGF / SF is a mitogen for epithelial cells and a motogen for epithelial cells and melanocytes. HGF / SF is also angiogenic and stimulates the growth of tumor cells of epithelial origin. The ligand for the MET receptor is HGF / SF, which is produced by mesenchymal cells. The MET receptor is widely expressed in epithelial tissues and is essential for normal development of muscle and neuronal tissues. The MET receptor is activated by HGF / SF, which induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain. Downstream signaling by the MET receptor includes activation of the ras pathway, PI3 kinase, and PLC gamma pathways. The Cbl protein binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue 1 2 3 4 in the MET receptor and is involved in down-regulation of the MET receptor. The endophilin proteins are involved in membrane trafficking and may be involved in receptor internalization. The association of the MET receptor with the Grb-2 family of adaptor proteins may be involved in the down-regulation of the MET receptor and in the mitogenic signaling of the MET receptor. The association of the MET receptor with the protein kinase C alpha and beta isoforms may be involved in the mitogenic signaling of the MET receptor. The association of the MET receptor with the Cbl protein may be involved in down-regulation of the MET receptor.",
  "The immune system is composed of two distinct arms: the innate immune system, which provides immediate protection against invading pathogens, and the adaptive immune system, which is comprised of B cells, T cells, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and is responsible for the long-term memory and memory responses. B cells produce antibodies that are responsible for the humoral immune response, while T cells provide cellular immunity by recognizing and destroying foreign cells. APCs, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are responsible for the processing and presentation of antigens to B and T cells. The presentation of antigen in the context of MHC molecules by APCs is required for T cell activation. Macrophages phagocytose foreign pathogens and present antigens in the context of MHC class II molecules to B cells and T cells. Dendritic cells are potent APCs and are found in many tissues, including the skin, where they are responsible for the processing of antigens and the activation of T cells. The complement system is an important component of the innate immune system that is activated when complement proteins are cleaved by the C3 convertase. The cleavage products of complement proteins, including the anaphylatoxin C3a and the membrane attack complex C5b, are responsible for the inflammatory response to infection. The opsonization of pathogens by complement proteins and the lysis of pathogens by the membrane attack complex are important components of the innate immune response.",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are a family of small GTPases that are involved in vesicle trafficking between different cellular compartments. ARFs are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and are deactivated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). The ARFs are grouped into three classes based on sequence homology. Class I includes yeast Arf1 and human ARF1--3. class II includes yeast Arf4p and human ARF4--5 and class III includes yeast Arf6--7. The yeast Arf proteins are essential for cell viability and are involved in secretion and vesicular transport. The mammalian ARFs are less essential and have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including secretion, endocytosis, intracellular membrane traffic, and intracellular lipid metabolism. The mammalian ARFs are also involved in vesicular transport, but their functions are not as well defined. The yeast ARFs are activated by a single Arf GEF, Sec7 1p, and the mammalian ARFs are activated by a family of GEFs known as cytohesins. The yeast Sec7 1p and the cytohesins are large multidomain proteins that share a common structural core of a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain is responsible for guanine nucleotide exchange and the PH domain is involved in the regulation of Arf GEF activity and membrane association. The Sec7 1p / cytohesin GEFs also contain a coiled-coil domain that mediates protein-protein interactions. The yeast Arf GAPs include Sys1p and Gcs1p. Sys1p is specific for Arf1 and is involved in vesicular transport between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum. Gcs1p is specific for Arl1p and is involved in the transport of vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane.",
  "Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaR) are a family of cell-surface receptors that bind the Fc portion of IgG and are expressed on the surface of a variety of cells, including leukocytes, macrophages, mast cells, NK cells, and neutrophils. FcgammaR are involved in a variety of immune responses, including phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles, activation of inflammatory cells, and development of antibody responses. FcgammaR are comprised of an FcRgamma chain associated with a heavy chain of different molecular weights. The FcRgamma chain is required for FcgammaR expression and is necessary for the activation of most FcgammaR signaling pathways. The cytoplasmic domains of FcgammaR contain the tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) that are required for downstream signaling. Upon receptor ligation, the FcRgamma chain is phosphorylated by src family kinases and serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of additional signaling molecules. The activation of src kinases leads to the phosphorylation of the ITAMs and the subsequent recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk. The activation of Syk leads to the activation of multiple downstream pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the p21GTPase pathway.",
  "Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation in a variety of tissues. In the epidermis, the major retinoid-responsive tissue, retinoids are critical for the maintenance of the normal differentiation process and for the prevention of skin cancer. The biologically active form of vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid (tRA), binds to two classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The RXR / RAR heterodimer binds to DNA at a consensus DNA sequence called the retinoic acid response element (RARE). In the absence of ligand, the heterodimer complex binds to transcriptional corepressors such as N-Cor and SMRT, which actively repress transcription. Binding of tRA to the RXR / RAR heterodimer causes a conformational change in the receptors, which leads to the release of the corepressors and the binding of transcriptional coactivators such as pCIP, CBP and CBP-associated factors. Transcriptional coactivators are involved in the modification of chromatin structure and the recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. The net effect of retinoid signaling is the activation of genes containing an RARE and the repression of genes lacking an RARE. The activation of genes containing an RARE leads to growth arrest and differentiation, while genes lacking an RARE are involved in growth arrest alone. The balance between the actions of these two groups of genes is critical for the maintenance of normal homeostasis in the epidermis. The ability of retinoids to induce growth arrest and differentiation in keratinocytes is thought to be responsible for the ability of these compounds to prevent skin cancer. The importance of retinoids in the maintenance of normal epidermal homeostasis and the prevention of skin cancer has led to the development of synthetic retinoids as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of hyperproliferative skin disorders and skin cancer.",
  "The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that defend against foreign pathogens and eliminate infected cells. The immune system is composed of two major parts, the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system consists of a variety of cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, that do not require previous exposure to antigen or the expression of specific antigen receptors and are able to respond immediately to infection. Innate immune cells recognize foreign pathogens through pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Macrophages phagocytose and degrade pathogens. The adaptive immune response requires the activation of a specific immune response against a particular antigen in the context of self-MHC molecules and is mediated by antigen-specific T cells and B cells. Naive T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs), that present antigen-derived peptides bound to MHC-I or MHC-II molecules on the cell surface. The interaction of T-cell receptor (TCR) with the MHC-peptide complex triggers T-cell activation. Naive B cells do not produce a functional antigen-specific TCR unless they are activated by APCs that present antigen-derived peptides bound to MHC-II molecules. The activation of B cells also requires the help of T cells.",
  "The protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is activated by trypsin and the peptide SFLLRN. PAR-2 is coupled to multiple signaling pathways including the mobilization of intracellular calcium, activation of the G (q) family of G proteins, and the Rho-dependent activation of the serine / threonine kinase, Rho kinase. The activation of PAR-2 by trypsin or synthetic peptides also leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is mediated by both the G (i) and G (q) families of G proteins. The PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is inhibited by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, indicating that the PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is mediated by the G (i) family of G proteins. The PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is also inhibited by the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-2 7 6 3 2, indicating that the PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is Rho-dependent. The PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is also inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF1 0 9 2 0 3X, indicating that the PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is also PKC-dependent. The PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is also inhibited by the MEK inhibitor, PD9 8 0 5 9, indicating that the PAR-2-induced activation of MAPK is mediated by the upstream kinase, MEK. The activation of PAR-2 also leads to the activation of the transcription factor, NF-AT, through the Rho-dependent kinase, ROCK. The activation of NF-AT by PAR-2 is inhibited by the MEK inhibitor, PD9 8 0 5 9, indicating that the PAR-2-induced activation of NF-AT is also mediated by the upstream kinase, MEK.",
  "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by a variety of mechanisms, including aerobic metabolism, exposure to environmental toxins, and inflammatory responses. ROS are highly reactive molecules that include the superoxide anion (O2 -), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ROS can damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA. Cells have evolved complex antioxidant systems to counter the effects of ROS. Glutathione (GSH) is a major cellular antioxidant that neutralizes ROS and protects cellular components from oxidative damage. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is a key enzyme in the glutathione antioxidant system that catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 and other peroxides using glutathione as a reducing agent. Glutathione reductase (GR) catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) back to reduced glutathione (GSH) using NADPH as a cofactor. NADPH is an important reducing agent in the cell and is generated by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). NADPH is also used by glutathione reductase to regenerate glutathione. The transcription factor NF-kB is activated by oxidative stress and regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. The activation of NF-kB by ROS is mediated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. ROS activate NF-kB by inducing the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitor protein IkB. The activation of NF-kB by ROS leads to the induction of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation.",
  "The cAMP response element (CRE) is a DNA regulatory sequence that mediates transcriptional activation by a diverse group of transcription factors, including CREB, AP-1, and NF-kappaB. The CRE is a TGACGTCA sequence that binds a basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) protein dimer. The bZIP proteins include CREB, c-Fos, c-Jun, and NF-kappaB. The bZIP domain mediates DNA binding and dimerization. The transcriptional activity of the bZIP proteins is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including phosphorylation by several kinases, dimerization with bZIP proteins, and interaction with coactivators and corepressors. The coactivator CBP interacts with the bZIP domain and the amino-terminal region of CREB. The interaction with CBP is regulated by phosphorylation of CREB at Ser119 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The interaction of CBP with CREB is also regulated by the phosphorylation of the bZIP domain of CREB by the p300 protein kinase. The p300 protein kinase is activated by the MAP kinase pathway. The interaction of CBP with the bZIP domain of CREB is inhibited by the binding of the adenovirus E1a oncoprotein to the KID domain of CREB. The bZIP domain of CREB also interacts with the p160 protein, which is a coactivator of the vitamin D receptor. The interaction of p160 with CREB is inhibited by the binding of E1a. The interaction of p160 with CREB also stimulates the interaction of p160 with CBP. The interaction of CBP with the bZIP domain of CREB is also inhibited by the binding of the ETO protein to the bZIP domain of CREB. The ETO protein is fused to CBP by the (8; 2 1) translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia.",
  "The Fas / FasL system is a key regulator of apoptosis in the immune system and other tissues. The Fas receptor is activated by its ligand, FasL, expressed on the surface of other cells. Binding of FasL to Fas results in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which includes the adaptor protein FADD and caspase-8. Caspase-8 activation leads to the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and other caspases, and cleavage of cellular targets that results in the execution of apoptosis.",
  "The mTOR pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. It is activated by growth factors, nutrients, and cellular energy status. The mTOR pathway is negatively regulated by the TSC complex, which consists of hamartin (TSC1), tuberin (TSC2) and the TBC1D7 protein. The mTOR protein kinase is the catalytic component of two distinct protein complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). In the presence of nutrients and growth factors, mTORC1 is activated and phosphorylates downstream targets such as the ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (4EBP). 4EBP is a repressor of the initiation of translation, and phosphorylation of 4EBP by mTOR relieves this repression, leading to increased translation of mRNAs with a 5 'terminal oligopolypyrimidine tract. S6K is a kinase that phosphorylates the 4EBP repressor, releasing it from its inhibitory effect on translation. In addition to 4EBP and S6K, mTOR also phosphorylates other substrates that regulate translation and other cellular processes. Rapamycin and its analogs (CCI-7 7 9, RAD0 0 1, AP2 3 5 7 3) inhibit mTOR and are being tested as anti-cancer agents.",
  "The immune system is a complex network of cells that defends against infectious agents and tumors. The immune system is composed of two major parts, the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and includes cells such as macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). The adaptive immune system is a more specific system that requires time to develop and is comprised of B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies and T cells are responsible for cellular immunity. Naive T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and DCs. The interaction between T cells and APCs leads to the activation of T cells and the proliferation of T cells. The activation of T cells requires two signals. The first signal is the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen-MHC complex. The second signal is provided by the interaction of costimulatory molecules on APCs with their receptors on T cells. The interaction between B7 and CD2 8 provides the costimulatory signal for T cell activation. The interaction of CD4 0 and CD1 5 4 provides the second costimulatory signal for T cell activation. The activation of T cells leads to the production of cytokines and the proliferation of T cells. Activated T cells provide help to B cells and macrophages to produce antibodies. Naive B cells are activated by antigen and cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) to become antibody-secreting plasma cells. The interaction between B cell receptor (BCR) and antigen-MHC complex leads to the proliferation and differentiation of B cells. The interaction between T cell-B cell receptor (TCR-BCR) provides the second signal for B cell activation. The differentiation of B cells into memory B cells and plasma cells requires the interaction of T cells with APCs.",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine that regulates the growth and differentiation of red blood cells. Epo binds to its receptor (EpoR) in the plasma membrane of erythroid cells and activates several signaling pathways. The JAK / Stat pathway is one pathway activated by EpoR that leads to the expression of genes involved in red blood cell differentiation. The MAPK pathway is also activated by Epo and leads to the expression of genes involved in red blood cell differentiation. The PI3 kinase pathway is also activated by Epo and leads to the activation of Akt and other kinases. The activation of these signaling pathways leads to the expression of genes involved in red blood cell differentiation.",
  "The protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their amino-terminus by the coagulation proteases thrombin and trypsin. The tethered peptide ligand that is unmasked by proteolytic cleavage binds to the body of the receptor and acts as a ligand to activate the receptor. The PAR family currently consists of four members, PAR1, PAR2, PAR3 and PAR4. PARs are expressed by a variety of cell types and are involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes including platelet activation, inflammation, and possibly cancer. PARs are activated by the coagulation proteases thrombin and trypsin, but can also be activated by the coagulation protease factor VIIa in the presence of the cofactor tissue factor. Synthetic peptides that mimic the tethered ligand can also activate the PARs. The tethered ligand is a peptide that is not present in the intact receptor and is revealed by receptor cleavage. The synthetic PAR-activating peptides are useful tools for studying the signaling properties of PARs and are often used in place of the protease agonist. PAR1 is activated by thrombin and trypsin, PAR2 by trypsin, and PAR4 by trypsin and the PAR4-activating peptide SFLLRN. PAR2 can also be activated by factor VIIa in the presence of tissue factor. PAR3 does not appear to function as a PAR and does not appear to be activated by any of the known PAR-activating proteases. The PAR-activating peptides are useful for studying the signaling properties of PARs and are often used in place of the protease agonist. The cleavage of PARs by coagulation proteases leads to the activation of G-protein signaling pathways including Gq, Gi and G1 2 / 1 3. G-protein activation leads to the release of intracellular calcium and the activation of downstream signaling pathways including the MAP kinase pathways. The activation of PARs also leads to the activation of Rho and the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. PARs are involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes including platelet activation, inflammation, and possibly cancer.

  "ErbB receptors are activated by the binding of their ligands, the EGF-like growth factors. The four members of the ErbB receptor family, EGFR / HER1, HER2 / neu, HER3 and HER4, share a common structure with an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The binding of ligands to the extracellular domain leads to the formation of receptor homo- or heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide binding sites for the recruitment of signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The activation of ErbB receptors results in the stimulation of several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. These pathways mediate a variety of cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.",
  "Presenilin is the catalytic component of gamma-secretase, an intramembrane protease that cleaves transmembrane proteins. Gamma-secretase cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilin is also involved in the processing of other transmembrane proteins, including Notch. Presenilin is required for gamma-secretase activity and its function is essential for development. Presenilin is a polytopic membrane protein with six transmembrane domains. The N-terminus of presenilin is oriented toward the cytoplasm, and the C-terminus is oriented toward the lumen of the ER or the secretory pathway. The N-terminal fragment of presenilin is generated by the action of signal peptidase and is further cleaved by an unknown protease to generate the N-terminal fragment of presenilin (NTF) and the C-terminal fragment of presenilin (CTF). The NTF and CTF form a stable complex, which is transported to the plasma membrane or the early secretory compartments. The CTF is subsequently cleaved within the membrane-spanning domain by an unknown protease to release the cytoplasmic domain of presenilin (PSH). The cytoplasmic domain of presenilin is involved in the gamma-secretase activity. The Notch signaling pathway is one of the best-characterized signaling systems in animals. Notch is a single-pass transmembrane receptor that is activated by binding to Delta or Jagged on the surface of a neighboring cell. The Delta / Jagged ligand is proteolytically removed in the signal-sending cell, and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the NICD interacts with CSL (CBF1 / Su (H) / Lag-1) family transcription factors and coactivators to activate transcription of target genes.",
  "The development of cancer is a multi-step process that involves the accumulation of genetic alterations in genes that control cell proliferation, cell death, angiogenesis, differentiation, senescence, and migration. The majority of human cancers are believed to result from the constitutive activation of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. The most commonly altered genes in human cancer encode proteins that regulate the mitogenic signaling pathways RAS / p53 and p60. These include receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, ERBB2, PDGFR), adaptor proteins (GRB2, IRS1), and the serine-threonine kinases (PI3K, AKT, p53).",
  "The mitochondrial respiratory chain is the main source of cellular energy in aerobic organisms. It is composed of four multiprotein enzyme complexes embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane. NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) is the entry point of electrons into the respiratory chain. It oxidizes NADH to transfer four protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane per NADH oxidized. The protons are pumped back into the intermembrane space by the respiratory chain complexes III and IV, creating an electrochemical gradient that is used by complex V to drive ATP synthesis. Complex I is a large protein complex with a total mass of about 1MDa. It is composed of at least 4 5 different subunits in mammals. The NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) is the most complicated of the four enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain. It is composed of a peripheral arm that receives electrons from NADH and transfers them to ubiquinone, and a membrane arm that pumps protons. The peripheral arm contains the NADH dehydrogenase activity and is made up of at least four different segments. The membrane arm contains the ubiquinone reductase activity and is made up of at least three different segments. The NADH dehydrogenase (or flavin-containing) segment transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. The iron-sulfur cluster (Nf) is the third segment. The fourth segment is the ubiquinone reductase (or iron-sulfur protein). The structure of the NADH dehydrogenase has been determined at the atomic level. The membrane arm is much simpler. The proton channel is formed by a single protein, the subunit ND1. The ND1 subunit is encoded by the mitochondrial DNA. The assembly of the NADH dehydrogenase complex is a complicated process involving the coordinated expression of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Defects in this system can lead to severe human disease.",
  "The development of the heart is a complex process that requires precise spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. The heart is derived from the embryonic mesoderm, and the formation of a heart tube from the cardiac crescent is a critical step in heart development. The cardiac tube is then remodeled into a four-chambered heart through the septation of the cardiac ventricles and the formation of the valves. The formation of the endocardial cushion is essential for proper heart development. Defects in this process can lead to congenital heart defects, which are the most common human birth defects. The formation of the endocardial cushion requires the coordinated proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, as well as the differentiation of these cells into smooth muscle cells. The proliferation and migration of the endocardial cells are regulated by a variety of growth factors, including FGFs, EGF, TGFs, BMPs, and PDGFs. The differentiation of the endocardial cells into smooth muscle cells is regulated by the transcription factors Nkx-2. 5, GATA4, and MEF2.",
  "Chondroitin sulfate is a linear polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharide units composed of N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid. Chondroitin sulfate is found in proteoglycans such as cartilage and in a variety of other tissues. Chondroitin sulfate chains are modified by sulfation at various positions, including the 4-position of the N-acetylgalactosamine and the 2-position of the glucuronic acid. The sulfation pattern of chondroitin sulfate chains is tissue-specific and changes during development. Chondroitin sulfate chains are also the linkage region of chondroitin sulfate in proteoglycans. The polymerization of chondroitin sulfate chains is catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme, chondroitin polymerizing factor (ChPF), which also acts as a bifunctional enzyme in the polymerization of heparan sulfate. The polymerization of chondroitin sulfate chains is also regulated by chondroitin synthase-1 and chondroitin synthase-2. The transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to the linkage region is catalyzed by chondroitin synthase-1. The transfer of glucuronic acid to the linkage region is catalyzed by chondroitin synthase-2. The transfer of both N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid to the linkage region is catalyzed by chondroitin polymerizing factor.",
  "Apoptosis is a form of cell death that is distinct from necrosis in that it results in the rapid and selective degradation of cellular structures and the subsequent formation of apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by neighboring cells or inflammatory cells. The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a key role in regulating apoptosis. Bcl-2 is an oncogene that inhibits apoptosis and blocks the action of several proteins in the Bcl-2 family that induce apoptosis. Bax is another Bcl-2 family member that induces apoptosis and antagonizes the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2. Other Bcl-2 family members such as Bak and Bad induce apoptosis and oppose the action of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 and Bax localize to the mitochondrial membrane and oppose each other's activity by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c activates Apaf-1, a protease that activates caspases involved in apoptosis. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are involved in apoptosis and are produced as inactive precursors that are activated by cleavage. Caspases are separated into two groups: the caspases that are involved in the execution of apoptosis (caspases-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5) and the inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, -4, and -5). Caspases are activated by two different mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the death receptors of the TNF family, such as Fas, that activate caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates caspase-3, -6, and -7, which are the effector caspases involved in apoptosis. Caspase-8 also cleaves Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, which translocates to the mitochondria and activates cytochrome c release. The second mechanism of caspase activation involves the mitochondria. Cytochrome c released from mitochondria activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3. Caspases are inhibited by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP), such as XIAP. The tumor suppressor protein p53 also plays a role in apoptosis, as well as in other cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and DNA repair.",
  "Hypoxia (low oxygen tension) is a common feature of many physiological and pathological processes. Cells respond to hypoxia by activating genes that allow them to survive and grow under low oxygen conditions. One of the genes activated by hypoxia is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a secreted growth factor that induces angiogenesis in response to hypoxia and plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF expression is induced by hypoxia through the transcription factor HIF-1. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta (ARNT). HIF-1 is induced by hypoxia and activates transcription of many genes including VEGF. HIF-1 is a member of a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family that also includes ARNT, USF1, USF2 and TFE3. HIF-1 is induced by hypoxia and activates transcription of many genes by binding to a core HRE (5 '-RCGTG-3') in their promoters. Genes activated by HIF-1 include those involved in erythropoiesis (e.g., EPO), in anaerobic metabolism (e.g., LDH-A), and in cell survival (e.g., Bcl2). Genes repressed by HIF-1 include those involved in angiogenesis (e.g., TSP2). HIF-1 is a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis and is induced by hypoxia to allow cells to survive and grow under low oxygen conditions. HIF-1 is a key target for developing cancer drugs that block tumor angiogenesis.",
  "Inflammation is a complex series of responses by the body to harmful stimuli, such as bacteria, viruses, or irritants. Inflammation is initiated by the activation of macrophages and other cells in response to irritants. Activated macrophages produce cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha that activate endothelial cells and other cells. Activated endothelial cells express adhesion molecules that interact with leukocytes and platelets. The interaction of leukocytes with endothelial cells is mediated by adhesion molecules. The interaction of platelets with endothelial cells is mediated by selectins. The interaction of leukocytes and platelets is mediated by integrins. The interaction of leukocytes and endothelial cells is essential for the immune response and inflammation.",
  "Receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis by phospholipase C generates two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 mobilizes intracellular calcium stores and DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). The other product, cADPR, activates a calcium release channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR), in a calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) mechanism. The activation of PKC by DAG leads to the down-regulation of the receptors through phosphorylation.

  "The immune system is comprised of cells that respond to specific antigens. The immune system can be separated into two categories, the innate immune system and the acquired immune system. The innate immune system is comprised of macrophages, natural killer cells, and other cells that respond to non-specific antigens. The acquired immune system is comprised of B cells and T cells that respond to specific antigens. B cells produce antibodies that bind specific antigens. T cells respond to specific antigens by either the helper T cell pathway or the cytotoxic T cell pathway. The helper T cell pathway involves the activation of B cells and the production of specific antibodies. The cytotoxic T cell pathway involves the activation of cytotoxic T cells and the killing of specific cells. The helper T cell pathway is required for the activation of cytotoxic T cells. The activation of helper T cells also leads to the activation of B cells and the production of antibodies. The helper T cell pathway is stimulated by antigens that are presented by MHC-II molecules on antigen presenting cells. Cytotoxic T cells are stimulated by antigens that are presented by MHC-I molecules. The cytotoxic T cell pathway is stimulated by antigens that are presented by MHC-I molecules. The CD40-CD40L interaction is required for the activation of helper T cells. CD40 is a cell surface molecule that is expressed on activated B cells and macrophages. CD40L is a soluble protein that is secreted by activated T cells. CD40-CD40L interaction is required for the activation of B cells and the proliferation of T cells. Cytotoxic T cells are stimulated by antigens that are presented by MHC-I molecules. CD40-CD40L interaction is required for the activation of cytotoxic T cells.",
  "The IGF-1R is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated by its ligand, IGF-1. IGF-1R activation stimulates proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. IGF-1R activation also stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth through the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is involved in the mitogenic effects of IGF-1 and is activated by IGF-1 through the PI3 kinase pathway. The mTOR pathway stimulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase and the initiation factor elF4E binding protein. The mTOR pathway also stimulates cell growth through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and inhibition of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1. The GSK-3 pathway inhibits cell cycle progression and is inhibited by IGF-1 through the PI3 kinase pathway. The mTOR pathway also stimulates proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through phosphorylation of the Bcl-2 family protein BAD.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone that regulates growth and metabolism. The GH receptor (GHR) is a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Binding of GH to the GHR activates several signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT pathway, the MAPK pathway, and the PI3 kinase pathway. These pathways are involved in regulation of gene expression, proliferation, and apoptosis.",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that play an important role in the early defense against viral infections and in the regulation of hematopoiesis. NK cells do not express antigen-specific receptors but express activating receptors that recognize specific ligands on target cells and inhibitory receptors that recognize MHC molecules. Upon recognition of target cells, NK cells release perforin and granzyme to induce apoptosis and also secrete cytokines that can modulate the function of other immune cells. The activating receptors include NKG2D, NKp4 6, NKp4 4, 2B4, and LFA-1. The inhibitory receptors include MHC-I-specific receptors, such as KIR and NKG2A, and the Ig-like receptors, such as LMIR. The balance of signals from these receptors determines the activation state of the NK cell.",
  "Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen that plays a critical role in development. In the developing nervous system, Shh acts as a mitogen for neuronal precursor cells in the developing cerebellum and spinal cord. In addition, Shh plays a role in the proliferation of granule cell precursors in the developing cerebellum. The mitogenic effect of Shh is mediated by the transcription factor Gli1, which activates the transcription of cell cycle genes such as cyclin D and c-myc. The activation of Gli1 by Shh is inhibited by the protein kinase Patched (Ptc), which is a receptor for Shh. Ptc is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in Ptc that lead to constitutive activation of Shh signaling have been identified in several types of cancer including basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. The activation of Gli1 by Shh is inhibited by the protein kinase PKA, which is activated by cAMP. The inhibition of Gli1 by PKA requires the phosphorylation of Gli1 by PKA at several sites. The activation of Gli1 by Shh leads to the transcription of cyclin D and c-myc, which in turn activate the cell cycle and contribute to the mitogenic effect of Shh. The role of Shh signaling in the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells may provide insights into the development of brain tumors and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
  "The actions of progesterone are mediated by two receptors, PR-A and PR-B. PR-A is a 9 4kDa protein that contains the DNA binding domain and the ligand binding domain of the PR-B receptor, but lacks the N-terminal AF1 domain. PR-B is 1 2 0kDa and contains an additional activation function domain, AF3, in its N-terminal region. PR-B is the only receptor that is able to activate gene transcription. PR-A functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of PR-B when the two receptors are coexpressed. The ratio of PR-B to PR-A can be altered by the presence of estrogen, which induces the expression of PR-B and decreases the expression of PR-A. In the absence of progesterone, PR-B is found in a multiprotein complex with heat shock proteins, immunophilins and other factors. Binding of progesterone to the PR causes a conformational change in the receptor, dissociation of the heat shock proteins, translocation of the receptor to the nucleus and dimerization of the receptor. PR dimers bind to specific progesterone response elements (PRE) in the promoter region of progesterone responsive genes. The interaction of PR with the PRE is stabilized by the interaction of the receptor with the general transcription factors, TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB. The interaction of the PR with TBP and TFIIB is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the PR. The interaction of the PR with other transcription factors such as c-jun, c-fos and CREB is mediated by the central and C-terminal domains of the PR. The interaction of the PR with the transcription coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p160 is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the PR. The interaction of the PR with the corepressors NCoR and SMRT is mediated by the central and C-terminal domains of the PR. The coactivators CBP and p160 increase the transcriptional activity of the PR by increasing the interaction of the receptor with the basal transcription factors and by histone acetylation. The corepressors NCoR and SMRT decrease the transcriptional activity of the PR by recruiting histone deacetylases to the promoter region of the progesterone responsive genes. The interaction of the PR with other signaling pathways is mediated by the interaction of the PR with other transcription factors. The interaction of the PR with the transcription factor CREB is mediated by the interaction of the N-terminal domain of the PR with the N-terminal domain of CREB. The interaction of the PR with the transcription factor c-jun is mediated by the interaction of the central and C-terminal domains of the PR with the leucine zipper region of c-jun. The interaction of the PR with the transcription factor Stat5 is mediated by the interaction of the N-terminal domain of the PR with the N-terminal domain of Stat5. The interaction of the PR with the transcription factor Sp1 is mediated by the interaction of the N-terminal domain of the PR with the DNA binding domain of Sp1. The interaction of the PR with the transcription factor p300 is mediated by the interaction of the central and C-terminal domains of the PR with the p300 transcription factor.",
  "The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) is a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor gene family and is activated by its ligand, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). CSF-1 is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. The CSF-1R is also involved in the proliferation and survival of tumor cells in some leukemias. The CSF-1R is a heterodimer with a transmembrane subunit of 9 0kDa and a tyrosine kinase subunit of 1 80kDa. Binding of CSF-1 to the receptor induces receptor dimerization, activation of the tyrosine kinase domain, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and binding of signaling molecules to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues. The major signaling pathways activated by the CSF-1R include the ras-map kinase pathway, PI3 kinase, and the p38 map kinase pathway. Activation of these pathways leads to changes in gene expression that result in cellular proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a key mediator of the actions of the second messenger cAMP. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. In the absence of cAMP, the C subunits are inhibited by the R subunits. Binding of cAMP to the R subunits causes the C subunits to dissociate and become active. The PKA regulatory subunits are encoded by four genes, prkar1a, prkar1b, prkar2a and prkar2b, which give rise to multiple isoforms through alternative splicing. The four PKA regulatory subunit genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and the different isoforms have distinct expression patterns. The cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) is a key transcription factor that is regulated by PKA. Phosphorylation of CREB at serine 1 3 3 by PKA leads to transcriptional activation of CREB-responsive genes. PKA also regulates other transcription factors such as EGR-1, ELK-1, STAT-1 and STAT-3. PKA can also regulate gene expression through phosphorylation of other transcription factors such as c-jun and c-fos. The activity of PKA is also regulated by the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are a family of structurally diverse proteins that coordinate the localization and the specificity of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. AKAPs bind to the regulatory subunits of PKA and localize the kinase in discrete subcellular locations. The subcellular localization of PKA is important for the specificity of PKA signaling. AKAPs also bind to other signaling molecules, such as the cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase 4D3 (PDE4D3), the phosphatase calcineurin, and the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The interaction of AKAPs with PDE4D3 and calcineurin regulates the hydrolysis of cAMP and the dephosphorylation of CREB. The interaction of AKAPs with PI3K is important for the regulation of the PI3K / AKT pathway by PKA.",
  "The clathrin-mediated endocytosis of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles at the synapse is a key mechanism for the rapid release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The assembly of clathrin with adaptor proteins AP2 and clathrin to form a clathrin-coated pit is a key step in endocytosis. The GTPase dynamin is required for the fission of the vesicle from the clathrin-coated pit. The dephosphorylation of dynamin by calcineurin is required for the completion of endocytosis. Calcineurin is activated by calmodulin, which is released from the calcium sensor protein calpacitin by the calcium-binding protein calmodulin kinase II (CamKII). The dephosphorylation of dynamin by calcineurin is required for the completion of endocytosis. The dephosphorylation of dynamin by calcineurin is also required for the recycling of the vesicle membrane and the reformation of the clathrin-coated pit. The dephosphorylation of dynamin by calcineurin is also required for the recycling of the membrane in non-neuronal cells. The dephosphorylation of dynamin by calcineurin is also required for the formation of clathrin-independent carriers (CLICs). Calcineurin is activated by calmodulin, which is released from the calcium sensor calpacitin by the calcium-binding protein CaM kinase II. Calmodulin kinase II is activated by the calcium-binding protein calmodulin. The formation of CLICs is stimulated by the activation of the EGF receptor and the subsequent activation of phospholipase Cgamma. The activation of phospholipase Cgamma by EGF leads to the production of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate, which activates PKC and Calmodulin kinase II, respectively. The activation of PKC and Calmodulin kinase II leads to the activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates dynamin, stimulating the formation of CLICs and the endocytosis of clathrin-coated pits.",
  "The peptide hormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates cell proliferation and migration in a variety of cell types. ET-1 is secreted by vascular endothelial cells and acts on ET (A) and ET (B) receptors on adjacent cells. ET-1 is a key mediator of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in response to hypertension and heart failure. ET-1 also stimulates proliferation of prostate cancer cells and may play a role in the development of renal and other cancers. ET-1 is also a potent mitogen for cultured astrocytes and may play a role in the reactive gliosis that accompanies brain injury. ET-1 is secreted by many different cell types and is present in the circulation in a prohormone form (big ET-1) that is cleaved by the protease endothelin converting enzyme (ECE1) to produce ET-1. ECE1 is also known as ADAM-1 2. The ET-1 peptide is cleaved from big ET-1 by the protease ACE to produce the mature peptide. ET-1 is rapidly degraded by neutral endopeptidases and is not detected in the circulation. ET-1 is a 2 1-amino acid peptide that is secreted by many different cell types. Big ET-1 is cleaved by the protease furin to produce ET-1, which is then secreted. ET-1 is a 2 1-amino acid peptide that is secreted and cleaved by the protease ACE to produce the mature peptide. ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor that acts on ET (A) and ET (B) G-protein coupled receptors to stimulate increases in intracellular calcium and activation of phospholipase C. ET-1 also activates phospholipase D and stimulates the formation of inositol phosphates. ET-1 also activates a number of other signaling pathways including activation of protein kinase C, the MAP kinase pathway, and the JAK / STAT pathway. ET-1 stimulates the proliferation of many different cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells, prostate cancer cells, and astrocytes. ET-1 stimulates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and prostate cancer cells through activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the transcription factor AP-1. ET-1 also stimulates the proliferation of astrocytes through activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. The peptide stimulates the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and prostate cancer cells through activation of AP-1 and NF-kB. The ET-1 receptor is a GPCR and is coupled to Gq / 1 1, Gs, and Gi. ET-1 stimulates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells through activation of AP-1 and NF-kB through activation of Gq and Gs. Activation of Gi is not required for proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. ET-1 stimulates proliferation of prostate cancer cells through activation of Gq and Gi. Activation of Gs is not required for proliferation of prostate cancer cells. ET-1 also stimulates proliferation of astrocytes through activation of Gq and G1 2 / 1 3. The ET-1 receptor is a GPCR and is coupled to Gq / 1 1, Gs, and Gi. ET-1 stimulates proliferation of astrocytes through activation of Gq and G1 2 / 1 3.",
  "The chemokine receptors are a family of GPCRs that are expressed on leukocytes and are activated by small chemoattractant peptides called chemokines. The chemokines are a family of cytokines that are involved in the regulation of leukocyte trafficking and activation. The chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR4 are activated by the chemokines MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and SDF-1, respectively. The chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5 are expressed on monocytes and macrophages, while CXCR4 is expressed on lymphocytes. The binding of chemokines to their receptors activates a variety of signaling pathways in leukocytes including the activation of G proteins, the MAP kinase pathway, and the JAK / STAT pathway. The activation of these signaling pathways leads to changes in gene expression and cellular responses.",
  "Neutrophils respond to inflammatory stimuli by increasing their expression of the chemokine receptor FPR1. This response is mediated by the transcription factor NF-kB, which binds to a site in the FPR1 promoter. The FPR1 promoter also contains a binding site for NFAT, which is involved in the regulation of other immune cell functions. The binding of NF-kB and NFAT to the FPR1 promoter is activated by the calcium flux that occurs when neutrophils are stimulated by inflammatory stimuli. The calcium flux activates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates and activates NFAT, and also activates the kinase MEKK1, which activates NF-kB. The activation of NF-kB and NFAT by the calcium flux is required for the induction of FPR1 expression by inflammatory stimuli. The activation of NF-kB and NFAT by the calcium flux is similar to the activation of these transcription factors by T cell receptor stimulation in lymphocytes. The similarity of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of FPR1 expression in neutrophils and lymphocytes suggests that the regulation of FPR1 expression may be a more general feature of immune cell activation.",
  "The release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores is a key mechanism in the control of many physiological processes. The release of Ca2 + is triggered by the binding of a variety of extracellular messengers to specific receptors coupled to second messenger pathways. The receptors coupled to inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) production are the InsP3 receptors (InsP3Rs), whereas the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are coupled to the production of InsP3 through the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are another intracellular Ca2 + release channel that is activated by the second messenger Ca2 + itself. The Ca2 + release through InsP3Rs and RyRs is a highly coordinated process that is regulated by various Ca2 + -sensing proteins. The Ca2 + sensor responsible for the activation of InsP3Rs is InsP3, whereas that for RyanRs is calsequestrin. The Ca2 + sensor responsible for the inhibition of InsP3Rs and RyanRs is calmodulin.",
  "The translocation of proteins across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) is mediated by signal recognition particles (SRPs) and the Sec-dependent protein translocation pathway. The targeting of proteins to the ER and the mitochondrial IM is accomplished by distinct signal recognition particles (SRPs). In bacteria, the SRP pathway is used to target membrane proteins that are synthesized in the cytosol. In contrast, in eukaryotes, the SRP is not involved in the targeting of cytosolic proteins to the ER membrane but rather recognizes the signal sequence of proteins that are translocated into the ER. The targeting of proteins to the mitochondrial IM is mediated by the twin-arginine translocase (Tat) pathway. This pathway is distinct from the general secretory (Sec) pathway in that it transports folded proteins and does not require ATP hydrolysis.",
  "The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells and is involved in the homing of hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow. CXCR4 also plays a role in HIV infection, as the chemokine receptor CCR5 is used by macrophage-tropic strains of HIV to infect macrophages. The ligand for CXCR4 is stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), also known as CXCL1 2. SDF-1 is a chemokine that is constitutively expressed in the bone marrow. Binding of SDF-1 to CXCR4 on the surface of hematopoietic cells activates a signaling pathway that includes the G-protein subunits Galphai, Galphaq, and phospholipase C-gamma 1. Downstream of this pathway are the kinases protein kinase C and map kinase, and the transcription factor NF-kB. The activation of this pathway by SDF-1 leads to chemotaxis of hematopoietic cells in vitro and may play a role in the homing of hematopoietic cells to the bone marrow.",
  "The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the biological effects of thyroid hormone. The TR exists in two major isoforms, TRalpha and TRbeta, which are encoded by separate genes. The TR binds to specific DNA sequences, TREs, in the promoter region of target genes and regulates their transcription in response to thyroid hormone. The transcriptional activity of the TR is regulated by a variety of corepressors in the absence of ligand and by corepressors in the presence of ligand. The corepressors include N-CoR and SMRT. The binding of ligand to the TR causes a conformational change in the receptor that results in the release of the corepressors and the association of a coactivator complex. The coactivators include SRC-1, pCIP, CBP, and pCAF. The binding of coactivators to the TR is dependent upon histone acetylase activity provided by CBP and pCAF. The binding of corepressors to the TR is dependent upon the action of a group of proteins including the mSin3 complex and the enzyme histone deacetylase. The corepressors and coactivators are recruited to the TR by a number of different proteins that interact with the TR in a ligand-dependent fashion. The corepressors dissociate from the TR in the presence of ligand and the coactivators are recruited. The binding of corepressors to the TR in the absence of ligand represses transcription, but the binding of coactivators to the TR in the presence of ligand activates transcription. The binding of corepressors to the TR in the absence of ligand represses transcription in a dominant negative fashion. The binding of corepressors to the TR in the absence of ligand represses transcription by two different mechanisms. One mechanism is that the binding of corepressors to the TR causes the formation of a transcriptionally inactive complex between the TR and the basal transcriptional machinery. The second mechanism is that the binding of corepressors to the TR causes the condensation of the chromatin structure in the promoter region of the target gene. The binding of coactivators to the TR in the presence of ligand causes an open chromatin structure and allows the binding of transcriptional activators and the basal transcriptional machinery to the promoter region of the target gene.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly coordinated series of events that lead to the duplication and segregation of chromosomes and the formation of two daughter cells. The progression through the cell cycle is governed by the coordinated action of cyclins (G1-S-G2-M) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (M-G1-S-G2-M.). CDKs are regulated positively by binding to cyclins and negatively by binding to CDK inhibitors (CDKIs). The activity of CDKs is also regulated positively by CDK-activating kinases (CAK) and negatively by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs). The checkpoint kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase family and is activated by DNA damage. ATM phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein p5 3, which in turn binds to the promoters of the CDKI genes CDKN1A (also known as p15) and CDKN1B (also known as p16). This results in the transcriptional activation of these genes, thereby inhibiting CDK activity and halting the cell cycle. CDKs are negatively regulated by CDKIs. CDKN2A (also known as p16) encodes two different proteins, p14ARF and p16. p14ARF inhibits the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which targets CDKs for degradation. p16is a CDK inhibitor that directly binds to and inhibits CDK2 and CDK1. CDKN1B (also known as p15) encodes p15, which inhibits the activities of CDK2 and CDK1. CDKN1B is transcriptionally activated by p53. The CDK inhibitor WEE1 (also known as p13) inhibits CDK1 and CDK2.",
  "Patched 1 (Ptc1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome). Ptc1 is a receptor for Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a secreted protein that is expressed in the developing CNS. Ptc1 is a receptor for Shh, and binding of Shh to Ptc1 relieves Ptc1-mediated inhibition of the 7transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). Smo activation leads to activation of the Gli family of transcription factors, which regulate the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation. Ptc1 is also a transcriptional target of Gli, creating a feedback loop that regulates Shh signaling. The role of Shh signaling in development of the CNS has been well documented, and the role of Shh signaling in the development of basal cell carcinoma has been recently reviewed.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of a family of genes that encode receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). These RTKs are involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Overexpression or mutation of EGFR has been implicated in the development and progression of a variety of human cancers. Overexpression of EGFR has been observed in up to 8 0% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. This overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or increased protein stability. Amplification of the EGFR gene is also observed in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), head and neck cancers, and breast cancers. Point mutations in the EGFR gene have been identified in NSCLC and these mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor. The most common mutation in NSCLC is a deletion in exon 2-7, which results in a truncated, ligand-independent receptor. The presence of this mutation in NSCLC patients correlates with a clinical response to the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa).",
  "The maturation of Xenopus oocytes into eggs is triggered by the steroid hormone progesterone. This process is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the synthesis of a specific group of mRNAs, the Mos-related mRNAs. The Mos protein kinase activates the MAP kinase pathway, which is essential for the resumption of the cell cycle. The polyadenylation of Mos-related mRNAs is stimulated by the CSF-Mos pathway and the poly (A) -binding protein.",
  "Allergy is a condition in which the immune system reacts to normally harmless antigens, such as pollen, dust, and food, by producing antibodies and other inflammatory mediators. The condition can be triggered by environmental factors, such as dust mites, cockroaches, and molds, and by certain foods. The condition is characterized by an increase in the number and activation of mast cells and eosinophils. The condition can also be triggered by infection with certain viruses, such as the common cold virus. The condition is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as steroids. The mast cells and eosinophils release a variety of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines. The activation of mast cells and eosinophils also causes damage to the airway epithelium. The airway epithelium secretes a variety of inflammatory mediators, including the cytokines IL-13 and IL-4. The cytokines stimulate mucus production and increase vascular permeability, allowing more inflammatory cells to enter the airway. The airway epithelium also secretes the anti-microbial protein eosinophil peroxidase, which kills bacteria. The activation of mast cells and eosinophils also causes damage to the airway epithelium. The activation of mast cells and eosinophils also causes damage to the airway epithelium. The airway epithelium secretes a variety of anti-microbial proteins, including the anti-viral protein interferon-gamma. The airway epithelium also secretes the anti-microbial protein eosinophil peroxidase, which kills bacteria.",
  "Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that act as extracellular signals in a variety of developmental processes. Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled (Fz) receptors and low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6 coreceptors to transduce signals. Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptors to activate two pathways, the canonical pathway and the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. In the canonical pathway, Wnt-Fz binding activates disheveled (Dsh), which inhibits the degradation of beta-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and leads to beta-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm. Beta-catenin then enters the nucleus and activates transcription by binding to TCF / LEF family transcription factors. In the PCP pathway, Wnt-Fz binding activates small GTPases RhoA and Rac, which activate the kinase JNK. JNK activation leads to phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and changes in cell shape and motility.",
  "The heat shock protein Hsp40 is a molecular chaperone that is induced by a variety of stresses, including heat, heavy metals, and oxidative stress. Hsp40 also plays a role in the immune response, acting as a co-stimulator of the T cell receptor. In addition to its role as a molecular chaperone, Hsp40 interacts with a variety of signaling molecules, including the transcription factor p53 and the protein kinase ASK1. Hsp40 interacts with p53 through a conserved domain, the TPR domain, which is also found in a number of other proteins involved in the stress response and in cell cycle control. Hsp40 interacts with the p53 DNA binding domain and inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional activation. The interaction of Hsp40 with p53 is disrupted by phosphorylation of p53 on serine 2 0 by the stress-activated protein kinase, map kinase. ASK1 is a MAPKKK that activates p53 in response to oxidative stress. The interaction of Hsp40 with ASK1 is disrupted by Hsp40, preventing the activation of p53 by ASK1. The interaction of Hsp40 with ASK1 and p53 may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis in response to stress. The interaction of Hsp40 with p53 may also play a role in the regulation of the heat shock response. The interaction of Hsp40 with ASK1 may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis in response to stress, while the interaction of Hsp40 with p53 may play a role in the regulation of the heat shock response.",
  "Spliceosomes are large ribonucleoprotein complexes that catalyze the excision of introns from precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) and the ligation of exons. Spliceosomes are composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, and many other proteins. Spliceosomes assemble on the 5 'splice site, the branch site, and the 3' splice site of the intron and catalyze two transesterification reactions.",
  "The attachment of proteins to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is a widespread feature of eukaryotic evolution. In mammals, more than 1 5 0 different proteins are attached to the cell surface via a GPI anchor. The GPI biosynthetic pathway is conserved from yeast to man and is essential in eukaryotes. The GPI anchor is attached to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the sequential addition of monosaccharides to the C-terminus of the protein. The GPI precursor is synthesized in the ER membrane and then transported to the Golgi. In the Golgi, the GPI precursor is remodeled by the addition of phosphoethanolamine (EtNP) residues and by side-chain modifications before it is attached to proteins.",
  "Insulin resistance is a key feature of type 2 diabetes. It is associated with impaired insulin signaling in liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The molecular basis of insulin resistance is complex and includes genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors include mutations in the genes of the insulin receptor and the insulin receptor substrate-1. Environmental factors include increased levels of circulating free fatty acids, increased levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and others), and increased levels of circulating glucocorticoids. These factors interfere with insulin signaling at several levels. They inhibit the expression of the insulin receptor and the insulin receptor substrate-1. They also activate stress-activated protein kinases, such as c-jun N-terminal kinase and inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB kinase. These kinases phosphorylate IRS-1 and IRS-2, thereby inhibiting the recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase. They also activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which leads to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and thereby to inhibition of insulin signaling.",
  "Tight junctions (TJs) are essential for the formation and maintenance of cell polarity and tissue integrity. TJs are formed by a specialized belt-like structure, the tight junction (zonula occludens), which occludes the intercellular space between adjacent cells. TJs are composed of a complex of integral membrane proteins, occludins, claudins and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), and of cytoplasmic plaque proteins, including the MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylate kinases), CRB3 (crumbs), PATJ (PAR-3) and PATJ-associated proteins. The cytoplasmic plaque proteins are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and in the assembly of the TJs.",
  "The olfactory receptor (OR) gene family is the largest known family of genes in the genome, with more than 1 0 0 0 members in the human genome. The function of the OR gene family is unknown, but it is hypothesized that they may be involved in olfaction. The OR family is divided into two broad classes, class I and class II, based on sequence similarity and tissue distribution. Class I genes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and class II genes are expressed in the testes. The OR genes are organized in a cluster in the genome, with each gene containing a coding region, a putative promoter region, and a downstream region containing a putative terminator. The coding region is separated from the putative promoter region by a cluster of simple sequence repeats (SSRs). The SSRs are thought to be involved in the regulation of the expression of the OR genes. The putative promoter region contains a MORE (MOdified Repetitive Elements) box, a sequence that is found in many promoters and enhancers. The MORE box is thought to be involved in the tissue-specific expression of the OR genes. The putative terminator region contains a polyadenylation signal and a cluster of CA repeats. The presence of the polyadenylation signal suggests that the OR genes are not polycistronically transcribed. The SSRs are thought to be involved in the regulation of the expression of the OR genes. The OR proteins are predicted to have seven membrane-spanning helices and are thought to be G-protein coupled receptors. The regulation of the expression of the OR genes is not known, but it is thought that the SSRs are involved in this regulation. The OR proteins are proposed to be involved in the detection of odorants. The regulation of the expression of the OR genes is not known, but it is thought that the SSRs are involved in this regulation. The OR proteins are proposed to be involved in the detection of odorants.

The OR proteins are proposed to be involved in the detection of odorants.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by binding of its ligand, epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes ErbB-2 (HER2 / neu), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4). Binding of EGF or other ligands to the extracellular domain of the EGFR results in receptor dimerization and activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide docking sites for a variety of signaling proteins, including the adaptor protein Shc, the docking protein Grb2, the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway. The downstream signaling pathways activated by the EGFR include the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the PI3-kinase pathway, and the phospholipase C-gamma pathway. These pathways regulate a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.",
  "Hypoxia is a common feature of growing tumors and is associated with resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia. HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits. HIF-1beta is constitutively expressed, whereas HIF-1alpha is induced by hypoxia. The induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia is mediated by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein. Inactivation of VHL in renal carcinoma cells leads to constitutive expression of HIF-1 and activation of HIF-1-responsive genes. HIF-1 induces expression of genes involved in erythropoiesis, glycolysis, vascular development, and cell survival. HIF-1 also induces expression of the gene encoding the angiogenic factor, VEGF. The induction of VEGF by HIF-1 is a key component of the angiogenic response to hypoxia. HIF-1 also induces expression of the glucose transporter gene, Glut-1. Glut-1 increases the uptake of glucose by cells and provides a mechanism for cells to survive under hypoxic conditions. HIF-1 also induces expression of genes that inhibit apoptosis, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. HIF-1 is induced by hypoxia through a post-translational mechanism. The induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia is independent of new protein synthesis, but is blocked by agents that inhibit cellular respiration, such as cyanide and hypoxia mimetics such as CoCl. The induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia is also blocked by inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, suggesting that mitochondrial function is required for HIF-1 induction by hypoxia. The induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia is blocked by antioxidants, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the hypoxia-induced activation of HIF-1. The induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia is also blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and by inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, suggesting that these signaling pathways are involved in the hypoxia-induced activation of HIF-1. The induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia is reversed by reoxygenation, suggesting that the cellular response to hypoxia is dynamic and that reoxygenation may lead to a decrease in HIF-1 activity. The reversal of the induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia by reoxygenation may be due to the rapid degradation of HIF-1alpha protein by reoxygenation. The induction of HIF-1 by hypoxia is also blocked by the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp9 0) inhibitor geldanamycin, suggesting that Hsp9 0 is involved in the regulation of HIF-1 by hypoxia. The molecular mechanisms that regulate HIF-1 activity are complex and involve multiple signaling pathways.",
  "Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins that are the major component of mucus. Mucin expression is often altered in cancer, and mucins can act as tumor suppressors in some cases. Mucin expression is also altered in inflammatory conditions, and mucins can act as anti-inflammatory agents. The MUC genes are clustered on chromosome 1q2 2-2 3, and are regulated by a large number of factors, including growth factors, cytokines, and hormones. Growth factors and cytokines can alter mucin expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Inflammatory agents can alter mucin expression transcriptionally, and can alter mucin glycosylation. Inflammatory agents can also alter mucin glycosylation, and this can alter the interaction of mucins with other factors. Growth factors and cytokines can alter mucin expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Cytokines can alter mucin expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Growth factors can alter mucin expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Inflammatory agents can alter mucin expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Inflammatory agents can alter mucin glycosylation, and this can alter the interaction of mucins with other factors. Alterations in mucin expression can alter many different aspects of cell behavior, including cell adhesion, cell signaling, and apoptosis.",
  "The multifunctional calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a key enzyme in the regulation of neuronal activity. CaM kinase II is activated by calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and NMDA receptors. The activation of CaM kinase II is mediated by calmodulin, which binds to the regulatory domain of CaM kinase II and induces a conformational change that exposes the catalytic domain. Autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II at Thr2 8 6 and Thr3 0 5 increases the calcium / calmodulin-independent activity of CaM kinase II. CaM kinase II phosphorylates a variety of substrates including other CaM kinases, ion channels, neuromodulin, and synapsin I. The activation of CaM kinase II by glutamate and calcium may play a role in long-term potentiation and learning and memory.",
  "The tachykinin NK1 receptor is activated by the neuropeptides substance P and neurokinin B. The NK1 receptor is coupled to G-proteins of the Gq family, which activate phospholipase C, generating IP3 and diacylglycerol. The IP3 released by the phospholipase C activates IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing release of calcium from this store. The increase in intracellular calcium activates a number of calcium-dependent signalling pathways. The diacylglycerol released by the phospholipase C activates the protein kinase C family of proteins. The activation of protein kinase C can activate ion channels and stimulate the MAP kinase cascade. The NK1 receptor can also activate the MAP kinase cascade through a G-protein independent mechanism involving the tyrosine kinase Src. The NK1 receptor is widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is involved in a variety of physiological processes including pain, emesis, and inflammation. The NK1 receptor is also expressed in a number of tumour cells where it may play a role in proliferation. The NK1 receptor is activated by substance P and the related peptide neurokinin B. The structure of the NK1 receptor has been determined by molecular biology techniques. The NK1 receptor is a rhodopsin-like GPCR with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus. The NK1 receptor is coupled to Gq proteins, activating phospholipase C, and also to Gi / o proteins, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. The NK1 receptor is also coupled to the activation of MAP kinase cascades, activating ras and raf, and also the MAP kinase kinase MEK. The NK1 receptor is subject to homologous and heterologous desensitization, a process involving phosphorylation of the receptor by a number of kinases including PKC, PKA and GRKs. Receptor phosphorylation uncouples the NK1 receptor from G-proteins, and also leads to receptor internalization. The internalization of the NK1 receptor may play a role in the desensitization of the receptor. The NK1 receptor is also subject to heterologous desensitization, being activated by a variety of other GPCRs. The NK1 receptor is also activated by the endogenous peptide agonist substance P (SP), but is also activated by the related peptide neurokinin B (NKB). SP is produced by the preprotachykinin A gene, and is cleaved to release SP as a biologically active peptide. The NKB gene encodes two peptides, neurokinin B and NKB-2 9. NKB is a product of the preprotachykinin B gene, and is cleaved to release NKB-2 9. SP and NKB are both potent neurotransmitters and neurotransmitters involved in a variety of physiological processes including pain, emesis, and inflammation. The NK1 receptor is also a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pain, emesis, and inflammatory disorders. The NK1 receptor has been cloned from a number of species including human, rat, and guinea pig. The amino acid sequence of the NK1 receptor is highly conserved across these species, with the greatest sequence difference between the human and rat receptors being at position 2 0 0, where the rat receptor has a threonine and the human receptor a methionine. The NK1 receptor has been expressed in a number of different cell types and the response to SP and NKB has been found to be similar in all cases. The NK1 receptor is also activated by the endogenous peptides NKA and NKB, but with lower potency than SP and NKB. The peptides NKA and NKB are produced by the preprotachykinin C gene, and are cleaved to release NKA and NKB as well as NKB-2 9. NKA and NKB are also called neurokinins A and B, and are involved in a variety of physiological processes including pain, emesis, and inflammation. The NK1 receptor is also activated by a number of other peptides including septide, GR6arebacyte, and GR6arebacyte-2 9. The NK1 receptor is also activated by a number of other peptides including neuropeptide Y, bradykinin, and angiotensin II. The peptide ligands for the NK1 receptor are classified into two groups, the SP-like peptides and the NKB-like peptides. The SP-like peptides include substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B. The NKB-like peptides include neurokinin B, neuropeptide gamma, and neuropeptide gamma-2 9. The NK1 receptor is also activated by a number of other peptides including neuropeptide Y, bradykinin, and angiotensin II. The peptide ligands for the NK2 and NK3 receptors are different from those of the NK1 receptor, and are classified as the tachykinins NK3, Neurokinin-4, and Neurokinin-4-related peptides.",
  "The multifunctional calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II is a key enzyme in the regulation of cellular calcium homeostasis and is involved in a variety of cellular processes including gene expression, muscle contraction, and neuronal plasticity.

  "The Na + / K-ATPase is an ion transporter that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive the transport of Na + and K + across cell membranes. It is an alpha beta heterodimer with each subunit having a different role. The alpha subunit is the ion-transporting subunit and is a member of the P-type ATPase gene family. The beta subunit is required for the proper expression and function of the alpha subunit. The gamma subunit is expressed in the kidney and may be involved in the regulation of the enzyme in this tissue. The beta subunit is required for the apical localization of the enzyme in the renal collecting duct. The FXYD protein family is a group of small single-span membrane proteins that modulate the activity of the Na + / K-ATPase. The gamma subunit is expressed in the kidney and may be involved in the regulation of the enzyme in this tissue. The FXYD proteins are related to the gamma subunit in that they have a conserved tyrosine residue in the center of a transmembrane segment. The other members of the family have a conserved aspartate residue in this position. The aspartate-containing members of the family (FXYD2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are Na + -K + -ATPase inhibitors, whereas the tyrosine-containing members (FXYD1, 3, 7, 8) are activators. The aspartate-containing FXYDs are expressed in tissues where the Na + / K-ATPase is not expressed, suggesting that they have other functions. The gamma subunit is expressed in the kidney and may be involved in the regulation of the enzyme in this tissue. The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (betaARK1) is involved in the regulation of the Na + / K-ATPase by G-protein coupled receptors. The Na + / K-ATPase is inhibited by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit by protein kinase A (PKA). The inhibition is reversed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation. The PKA phosphorylation site is located in the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha subunit. The betaARK1 is a G-protein coupled receptor kinase that phosphorylates the beta-adrenergic receptor in response to agonist binding. The phosphorylated receptor is a better substrate for PKA than the Na + / K-ATPase. The betaARK1 is also a substrate for PKA. The betaARK1 is inhibited by PKA-dependent phosphorylation. The inhibition of betaARK1 by PKA may serve to keep the Na + / K-ATPase active during conditions that stimulate the G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway.",
  "The innate immune response is triggered by the recognition of conserved microbial structures by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The two major classes of PRRs are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). TLRs are expressed on the cell surface or in endosomal compartments and recognize microbial membrane components, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoproteins, peptidoglycans, and flagellin. RLRs are expressed in the cytosol and recognize viral RNA. Upon recognition of viral RNA, RLRs trigger signaling cascades that lead to the production of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines. The RLR family includes RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RIG-I and MDA5 contain two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a DExD / H box helicase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). LGP2 lacks a CARD but contains a helicase domain and a CTD. Upon recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I and MDA5 interact with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), also known as IPS-1, Cardif, or VISA. MAVS then activates the transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-kB, which induce the expression of type I interferon and other inflammatory cytokines.",
  "Cholesterol is a precursor of steroid hormones, bile acids, vitamin D and vitamin E. The biosynthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl-CoA, which is converted to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS). HMG-CoA is converted to mevalonate by the subsequent enzymes of the mevalonate pathway. The first committed step in the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the universal precursors of isoprenoids, is the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACAT). Acetyl-CoA is also the source of the activated two-carbon unit, which is transferred to the 4-carbon IPP by the enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. IPP and DMAPP are then condensed to form the five-carbon prenyl diphosphate compound geranyl diphosphate (GPP). The next step in the pathway is the formation of the 1 0-carbon IPP unit, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), from DMAPP by IPP isomerase. The next step in the pathway is the condensation of IPP with another DMAPP to form the 1 5-carbon farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). The next steps in the biosynthesis of sterols and nonsterol isoprenoids are catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as terpene synthases. The cyclization of FPP to squalene is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of sterols. Squalene is cyclized to form the pentacyclic triterpenoid squalene oxide by squalene cyclase. Squalene oxide is cyclized to form the tetracyclic compound cycloartenol by the enzyme oxidosqualene cyclase. The oxidosqualene cyclase also catalyzes the cyclization of oxidosqualene to form the pentacyclic triterpenoid hopene. The oxidosqualene cyclase also catalyzes the conversion of squalene to 2, 3-oxidosqualene, the precursor of the triterpenoid precursor of carotenoids. The conversion of 2, 3-oxidosqualene to the tetracyclic compound lupeol is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the pentacyclic triterpenoid oleanolic acid. The cyclization of lupeol to betulinic acid is catalyzed by oxidosqualene cyclase. The oxidosqualene cyclase also catalyzes the formation of the hopane family of triterpenoids. The cyclization of 2, 3-oxidosqualene to cycloartenol is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics. The cyclization of 2, 3-oxidosqualene to the tetracyclic compound uvaol is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin. The tetracyclic compound abafungin is the precursor of the antifungal agent acarbose.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid metabolite with diverse and sometimes opposing biological actions. S1P is produced by the sphingosine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of sphingosine, and is degraded by S1P phosphatases and lyase. S1P is a ligand for a family of G-protein coupled receptors, termed S1P1-5. S1P is a potent mitogen for a variety of cell types, and S1P signaling through its receptors regulates cell migration, proliferation, and survival. S1P signaling is involved in angiogenesis and vascular maturation, and may also play a role in inflammatory responses and asthma. S1P signaling is also involved in lymphocyte trafficking, and may play a role in lymphocyte homing and cancer. S1P signaling may also play a role in heart disease through its effects on heart cells. The S1P2 receptor is coupled to Gi, Gq, and G1 2 / 1 3, and couples to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and stimulation of phospholipase C, Rho activation, and stimulation of the serum response factor. Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase may also be involved. Rho activation and serum response factor activation may lead to changes in cytoskeletal structure and cell motility. Gi-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C may lead to calcium release and changes in heart rate and rhythm. Rho activation may lead to changes in cell shape and motility. S1P2 couples to G1 2 / 1 3 and stimulates the Rho-dependent kinase, p1 6 0ROCK. This pathway may lead to changes in cell shape and motility. Rho activation may also lead to changes in cell motility through changes in actin stress fiber formation. The S1P3 receptor couples to Gi, but also couples to Gq and G1 2 / 1 3. Rho activation by S1P3 may lead to changes in cell shape and motility through changes in the actin cytoskeleton. The S1P4 receptor couples to Gi, but also couples to G1 2 / 1 3. The S1P5 receptor couples to Gi and G1 2 / 1 3. The S1P6 receptor couples to Gi and Gq.",
  "The coagulation cascade is a series of reactions that lead to the formation of a clot at the site of vascular injury. The first step is the activation of prothrombin by the tissue factor (TF) / factor VII complex. This reaction is called the initiation step. The next steps are the activation of factors V and X by the TF / factor VIIa complex, the formation of the prothrombinase complex, the cleavage of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex, and the activation of factors XI and XII. The final step is the clot formation by thrombin, which converts soluble fibrinogen into a clot that is stable in the blood. The coagulation cascade is negatively regulated by several factors. Tissue factor (TF) is the main trigger of the coagulation cascade. It is expressed by cells in the vascular wall and by cells in the extravascular space. TF is released from the cell membrane into the blood in response to tissue damage or inflammation. The TF / factor VIIa complex activates factors X and V, initiating the coagulation cascade. The TF / factor VIIa complex is short-lived and is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The TF / factor VIIa complex is also inhibited by antithrombin (AT) and by the zymogen protein C (PC). Protein C is activated by the thrombin-activated factor V (Va). The activated protein C (APC) in the presence of protein S (PS) inhibits factors Va and VIIIa, thus inhibiting the further activation of factors X and IX. The inhibition of factors Va and VIIIa by APC also leads to the degradation of the fibrinogen by thrombin. Antithrombin is a plasma protein that inhibits thrombin. Antithrombin deficiency is associated with a severe bleeding disorder.",
  "Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and other mammals. The etiology of these diseases is linked to the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP C) into a protease-resistant, beta-sheet-rich isoform (PrP Sc). PrP Sc is the major component of the infectious agent responsible for prion diseases, or prions. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc is believed to occur post-translationally, and is thought to occur by a seeded polymerization mechanism. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc is accompanied by a conformational change that results in the acquisition of partial resistance to proteolysis and a strong tendency to aggregate. The accumulation of PrP Sc in the brain may lead to neuronal death through a gain-of-function mechanism, or through a loss-of-function mechanism. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc may also trigger a cascade of events that lead to neuronal death. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc may also affect the function of the normal cellular prion protein. The normal cellular prion protein is involved in copper metabolism, synaptic plasticity, signal transduction, and cell survival. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc may affect the function of the cellular prion protein. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc may also affect the function of the normal cellular prion protein. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc may also affect the function of the normal cellular prion protein.",
  "The Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway is activated by the binding of Fas ligand to Fas. This interaction leads to the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to the cytoplasmic domain of Fas. FADD in turn recruits pro-caspase 8 through a homophilic interaction between the death domains of each protein. Pro-caspase 8 is then cleaved and activated, and in turn activates other caspases that lead to apoptosis.",
  "Calmodulin (CaM) is a small acidic protein that binds calcium with high affinity. It is involved in many cellular processes, including calcium signaling, muscle contraction, and gene expression. The binding of calcium to CaM causes a conformational change that exposes a binding site for other proteins. One of the CaM-binding proteins is calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that is involved in calcium-mediated signal transduction. Calcineurin is activated by CaM binding, and CaM binding is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK5 0 6. The binding of CaM to calcineurin causes a conformational change that exposes a catalytic site that dephosphorylates p38IkappaBalpha, releasing the transcription factor NF-AT to move into the nucleus and activate transcription. The binding of CaM to calcineurin is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK5 0 6, which bind to immunophilins that also bind CaM. Another CaM-binding protein is CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). CaM kinase II is a protein kinase that is activated by calcium and CaM. CaM kinase II is involved in many cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation. The binding of CaM to CaM kinase II causes a conformational change that exposes a catalytic site that phosphorylates other proteins. The binding of CaM to CaM kinase II is inhibited by the CaM kinase inhibitor peptide, KKALRRQEQIVA. The binding of CaM to calcineurin is inhibited by the autoinhibitory domain, a region near the amino terminus of the enzyme that inhibits the activity of the enzyme until CaM binds. The binding of CaM to CaM kinase II is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor peptide, which is a peptide derived from the CaM kinase II autoinhibitory domain.",
  "T cells are lymphocytes that recognize specific antigens in the form of peptides bound to MHC-1 molecules on the surface of other cells. T cells can be subdivided into two major classes, T helper cells and T cytotoxic cells. T helper cells are involved in the cellular immune response and produce cytokines that stimulate the proliferation and activation of other immune cells. T cytotoxic cells are involved in the humoral immune response and kill cells that display specific antigens on their surface. The T cell receptor (TCR) complex on the surface of T cells recognizes the peptide-MHC-1 complex on the surface of other cells and this interaction is required for T cell activation. T cell activation also requires the presence of costimulatory signals provided by cells that interact with the T cell receptor complex. The interaction of the T cell receptor with the peptide-MHC-1 complex causes the T cell to be activated and to proliferate. T cell activation also requires the interaction of the costimulatory receptor CD2 8 with its ligand B7 on the surface of other cells. T cell activation is a complex process that requires the integration of signals from the TCR, costimulatory receptors, and cytokines.",
  "The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) is an endogenous mechanism that helps to keep the body from overreacting to injury or infection. The CAP is activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) released from the vagus nerve. The CAP inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages and other cells in response to infection or injury. The anti-inflammatory signal is transmitted by the alpha7 nicotinic ACh receptor (alpha7nAChR), which is expressed on macrophages and other cells. The alpha7nAChR is coupled to the inhibitory G protein Gi, which inhibits the activity of the downstream kinase AKT. The inhibition of AKT leads to the activation of the transcription factor FOXO3a, which in turn induces the expression of the death receptor Fas ligand (FasL) on macrophages. FasL binds to the Fas receptor on other cells, activating the apoptotic pathway. The CAP may help to keep the body from overreacting to infection or injury.",
  "Skeletal muscle contraction is triggered by the release of Ca2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the cytosol of the muscle fiber. The release of Ca2 + is triggered by the binding of Ca2 + to the ryanodine receptor (RYR), a large transmembrane protein of the SR. The binding of Ca2 + to RYR causes the channel to open and release Ca2 + into the cytosol. The amount of Ca2 + released by RYR is determined by the amount of Ca2 + in the SR. The amount of Ca2 + in the SR is determined by the balance of Ca2 + uptake into the SR by the sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) and Ca2 + efflux from the SR by the RYR. The release of Ca2 + from the SR is stimulated by the binding of calmodulin (CaM) to the RYR. The binding of CaM to RYR is stimulated by the binding of Ca2 + to CaM. The binding of Ca2 + to CaM also activates the Ca2 + release channel. The binding of Ca2 + to CaM also inhibits the reuptake of Ca2 + into the SR by the SERCA pump. The binding of Ca2 + to CaM also activates the protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. The binding of acetylcholine (ACh) to the nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) on the surface of skeletal muscle causes the opening of a cation channel in the receptor. The influx of cations through the nAChR depolarizes the cell membrane and activates voltage-gated L-type Ca2 + channels in the plasma membrane. The influx of Ca2 + through the L-type channels in turn activates the release of Ca2 + from the SR. The influx of Ca2 + through the nAChR also activates the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. The activation of the PKC pathway may also contribute to the release of Ca2 + from the SR.",
  "The paired box transcription factors are a family of developmental control genes that play a key role in the development of the midbrain and limb buds in vertebrates. The Pax gene family contains nine members in mammals, Pax-1 through Pax-9. Pax-3, a member of the Pax gene family, is expressed in the developing central nervous system and is essential for normal brain and midbrain development. Pax-3 is also expressed in the developing limb buds and is required for normal development of the forelimb and hindlimb. The paired domain is a DNA binding domain found in many transcription factors and is found in paired-box containing genes. The paired domain of Pax-3 binds to a consensus sequence of TCAG (N) 6GAG. The paired domain of Pax-3 also binds to the sequence GTACGGAT, which is similar to the consensus sequence, but with a T in place of the G or A in the middle position. The paired domain of Pax-3 binds to this site with a higher affinity than to the consensus sequence. The paired domain of Pax-3 also binds to the sequence GTACGGAT with a higher affinity than the consensus sequence. The binding of the paired domain of Pax-3 to the GTACGGAT sequence is inhibited by the presence of a G in the middle position. The presence of a G in the middle position of the consensus sequence does not inhibit binding of the paired domain of Pax-3 to the consensus sequence. The presence of a G in the middle position of the consensus sequence does not inhibit binding of the paired domain of Pax-3 to the consensus sequence. The presence of a G in the middle position of the consensus sequence does not inhibit binding of the paired domain of Pax-3 to the consensus sequence.",
  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may lead to sudden cardiac death. The hallmark of ARVC is the replacement of cardiac myocytes with adipose and fibrous tissue. The pathological hallmark of ARVC is the presence of intramyocardial fat and / or extensive myocyte loss. The prevalence of ARVC is estimated to be 1 in 1 0, 0 0 0. The disease is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins that are involved in the structure and function of the cardiac desmosome. The desmosome is a protein complex that holds together adjacent cells in the heart and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the heart. Disruption of desmosome function may lead to myocyte death and fibrofatty replacement of cardiac tissue. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the molecular basis of ARVC.",
  "The complement system is an important part of the immune system. It is part of the humoral response to infection and injury. It is activated by three different pathways. The classical pathway is activated by the presence of foreign antigen, antibody, and complement proteins. The first step is the binding of antigen-antibody complexes to the Fc region of the antibody. This binding causes the activation of the C1 complex, which consists of three proteins: C1q, C1r, and C1s. The C1 complex is a protease complex that cleaves C4 and C2 to form the C4b2a complex. This complex is a protease that cleaves and activates C3. The C3 convertase cleaves and activates additional C3 molecules, forming the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC causes lysis of foreign cells and is the final step in the complement cascade. The alternative pathway is activated by foreign cell membranes or aggregates of proteins. In this pathway, the first step is the spontaneous activation of C3. This results in the formation of C3 (H2O). C3 (H2O) is a cleavage product of C3 that has not yet been cleaved by C3 convertase. C3 (H2O) can form a C3 convertase with factor B and factor D. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3, forming the amplification loop. The alternative complement pathway is important in the early stages of infection and is also activated by ischemia and reperfusion injury. The complement cascade results in the formation of several different proteins that can act as opsonins, activate inflammatory cells, and lyse foreign cells. The complement cascade is regulated by a group of proteins called complement regulatory proteins. Inappropriate regulation of the complement system can lead to tissue damage and disease.",
  "Granzyme A and granzyme B are serine proteases that are released from cytotoxic T cells and NK cells and enter the target cell to induce apoptosis. Granzyme A cleaves the nuclear protein SET, releasing the histone chaperone NAP-1 and inducing apoptosis. SET is also a substrate for protein kinase CK2, which phosphorylates SET and blocks its cleavage by Granzyme A. The SET protein is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and apoptosis. The DNA repair enzyme APE-1 is also a substrate for Granzyme A and is also cleaved to induce apoptosis. Granzyme A also cleaves the transcription factor CREB to block transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. Granzyme B cleaves Bid to induce apoptosis.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Three PPAR subtypes (PPARalpha, beta / delta, and gamma) have been identified in vertebrates. Each PPAR subtype has distinct tissue distribution and regulates the expression of different genes involved in lipid metabolism. PPARalpha is highly expressed in the liver and plays a key role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by activating genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. PPARbeta / delta is ubiquitously expressed and plays a role in lipid metabolism in many tissues. PPARgamma is highly expressed in adipose tissue and plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation. The activation of PPARgamma by its ligands stimulates adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity.",
  "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the immune response. IL-1 is produced by a variety of cells in response to infection or tissue injury. IL-1 is a key mediator of fever, pain, and other responses to infection. IL-1 is a member of a family of cytokines that also includes IL-1 8 and IL-1F2. IL-1 is produced as an inactive precursor that is cleaved by a protease called IL-1converting enzyme (ICE) to produce the active form. ICE is also involved in the activation of other cytokines involved in the immune response. IL-1 is a key mediator of the inflammatory response and is a key component of arthritis.

  "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are neurotransmitters and hormones that are widely distributed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. They exert their actions through three G-protein coupled receptors, VPAC and VPAC, coupled to the AC / cAMP / PKA and PLC / PKC second messenger pathways. They exert their actions through the activation of several transcription factors, including CREB, NF-AT, and NF-kB.",
  "Hypoxia is a reduction in tissue pO tension below the level of oxygen delivery, which occurs in many physiologic and pathologic processes including development, wound healing, and ischemia. Cells respond to hypoxia by increasing the expression of genes involved in oxygen delivery and decreasing the expression of genes involved in oxygen consumption. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays a key role in the cellular response to hypoxia. In the presence of oxygen, HIF-1 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha by a family of prolyl hydroxylases targets HIF-1 for ubiquitination and degradation. HIF-1 activation by hypoxia leads to increased expression of genes involved in oxygen delivery, such as erythropoietin, and decreased expression of genes involved in oxygen consumption, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Decreased oxygen consumption in response to hypoxia leads to a reduction in the intracellular pO, which in turn activates a pathway involving the tumor suppressor VHL, elongin B, elongin C, and cullin-2 that targets the transcription factor HIF-1 for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. VHL is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Binding of the VHL protein to HIF-1 blocks the interaction between HIF-1 and the ubiquitin ligase complex, preventing ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1. Nonhypoxic signals that increase the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) also activate HIF-1. ROS activate the HIF-1 pathway by inhibiting the degradation of HIF-1, increasing the half-life of HIF-1. ROS also activate the MAPK pathway, which can stimulate HIF-1 activity by a mechanism independent of HIF-1 stabilization. HIF-1 is also activated by hypoxia-independent mechanisms. For example, HIF-1 is activated by the oncogene HER-2 / neu, which activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. HIF-1 activation by hypoxia and by other stimuli such as growth factors and oncogenes may play a role in the development and progression of cancer.",
  "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are widely distributed neuropeptides with potent effects on many different cell types. They are involved in a variety of physiological processes such as regulation of endocrine and exocrine secretion, neuronal transmission, and smooth muscle contraction. The biological effects of VIP and PACAP are mediated by two different G-protein coupled receptors, VPAC and VPAC. Both peptides are able to activate adenylate cyclase through the G (s) -protein coupled receptor, but they also can activate phospholipase C through the G (i) -protein coupled receptor. The activation of these second messenger systems leads to the activation of protein kinase A and protein kinase C, which in turn can activate a variety of transcription factors. The activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) by VIP and PACAP has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the expression of several genes. The activation of the transcription factor AP-1 by VIP and PACAP has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the expression of the genes encoding the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun. The activation of the transcription factor CREB by VIP and PACAP has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the expression of the gene encoding the neuropeptide VIP itself.",
  "Chemokines are small chemoattractant cytokines that are classified into four groups, the CC, CXC, C and CX3C chemokines, based on their N-terminal amino acid sequence similarity. The chemokine family is large and includes more than 5 0 members in humans. Chemokines are small proteins (8-1 0 kDa) that are secreted by a variety of cells and act as chemoattractants for leukocytes, lymphocytes, and other cell types. Chemokines are involved in many physiological and pathological processes, such as immune responses, inflammation, angiogenesis, and development of the hematopoietic system. Chemokines exert their biological functions by binding to their receptors on the cell surface. Most chemokine receptors belong to the rhodopsin-like 7TM receptor family. The chemokine receptors are classified into four groups, CXC receptors (CXCR1-4), CC receptors (CCR1-5, CCR2B, CCR3L1-3, and CCR5), CX3C receptors (CX3CR1), and the atypical chemokine receptor.",
  "The immune system consists of two major parts, the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system is present in all organisms and provides immediate protection against invading pathogens. The adaptive immune system is generated only in higher organisms and provides a more specific response to pathogens. The innate immune system consists of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Macrophages and neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Macrophages phagocytose and destroy invading pathogens, and neutrophils release reactive oxygen species and proteases to kill and digest pathogens. Macrophages and neutrophils also secrete cytokines that stimulate the immune system. NK cells are lymphocytes that provide a rapid response to infection and malignancy. NK cells are also involved in the regulation of other immune cells, such as T cells. Macrophages and neutrophils secrete cytokines that stimulate the adaptive immune system. Macrophages and neutrophils also present antigens to T cells, stimulating the proliferation and activation of T cells. T cells are a key component of the adaptive immune system, as they are responsible for the specificity of the immune response. T cells are classified into two groups, helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells, such as those in mice that express the CD40 receptor, stimulate B cells to proliferate and produce antibodies that bind to and inactivate specific pathogens. Cytotoxic T cells, such as those in mice that express CD80, are cytotoxic cells that kill cells that express the same antigen. Cytotoxic T cells are stimulated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells, to proliferate and secrete cytokines that stimulate the immune response. APCs present antigen to T cells in the form of peptides bound to MHC molecules on the surface of the APC. The CD40 receptor is required for T cell activation. The CD40 ligand is CD28, which is expressed on the surface of activated B cells and some T cells. The CD40 ligand is expressed on activated macrophages and is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines.",
  "The meiotic maturation of oocytes is triggered by the maturation-inducing steroid (MIS), progesterone in vertebrates. The signal transduction pathway activated by the MIS is similar to that activated by growth factors. The tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is activated by binding of MIS, and the activated EGF receptor phosphorylates and activates the tyrosine kinase, c-Src. The activity of the small G protein Ras is increased by the action of growth factor receptors and MIS receptors. The activity of the G protein, Gqalpha, is also increased by the action of growth factor receptors and MIS receptors. The activation of Ras and Gqalpha leads to the activation of the MAP kinase cascade, which includes Raf, MEK and MAPK. The activation of the MAP kinase cascade is essential for the resumption of meiosis. The activation of MPF, the cyclin B-Cdc2 kinase, is also essential for the resumption of meiosis.",
  "Leukocyte adhesion is a key step in the inflammatory response. During an inflammatory response, circulating leukocytes roll along the endothelium of the blood vessel wall, then adhere to the endothelium and migrate into the underlying tissue. This process is mediated by a family of cell surface adhesion molecules called integrins. Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Members of the integrin family include the leukocyte integrins LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1), Mac-1 (macrophage antigen 1), and VLA-4 (very late antigen 4), which are involved in the adhesion of leukocytes to other cells. The selectins are a family of cell surface glycoproteins that mediate the initial attachment of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium during inflammation. Selectins are expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells and mediate the initial attachment of leukocytes. The interaction of selectins with their ligands is calcium-dependent. The interaction of selectins with their ligands is also reversible, allowing leukocytes to roll along the endothelium and then be arrested by integrin-mediated interactions.",
  "Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are central to the apoptotic signaling pathways. Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that are activated through proteolytic cleavage. Once activated, caspases cleave a variety of cellular targets, leading to the morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a key effector caspase that is activated by a variety of apoptotic stimuli and cleaves a variety of cellular targets. One of the cellular targets of caspase-3 is DFF4 0 / CAD, a caspase-3 substrate that normally functions to maintain genomic stability by cleaving chromosomal DNA. Caspase-3 cleavage of DFF4 0 / CAD results in the activation of DFF4 0 and the subsequent degradation of chromosomal DNA. Another caspase-3 substrate is PARP, an abundant nuclear enzyme that is involved in DNA repair. Caspase-3 cleavage of PARP results in the depletion of cellular NAD + and ATP, which can lead to cell death by necrosis. Another caspase-3 substrate is golgi-associated apoptosis related protein (GARP). GARP is localized to the Golgi apparatus and is involved in vesicular transport. Caspase-3 cleavage of GARP may lead to the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus that is observed during apoptosis.",
  "TNF is a cytokine that induces a variety of cellular responses including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and inflammation. The biological activities of TNF are mediated by two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR1 contains a cytoplasmic death domain that is essential for TNF-induced apoptosis. TNFR2 does not have a cytoplasmic death domain and transmits signals through TRAF proteins to activate NF-kB and other signaling pathways.",
  "The immune system is composed of a variety of cells and proteins that work together to protect the body from harmful pathogens. T cells are a key component of the immune system and are essential for the response to infection. Naive T cells recognize antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the context of MHC molecules. Naive T cells are classified into two types, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Naive CD4 + T cells are further classified into two subsets, Th1 and Th2 cells, based on the cytokines they produce. Th1 cells produce interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulate macrophage activation and promote cell-mediated immune responses. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10, which stimulate B cell activation and eosinophil proliferation and activation. In addition to these cytokines, naive CD4 + T cells can differentiate into regulatory T cells (Treg) that suppress the activation of other T cells. The differentiation of naive CD4 + T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells is influenced by the cytokines in the local environment. Treg cells are induced by TGF-beta and IL-1 0 and suppress the activation of other T cells.",
  "Epithelial cell polarization is a fundamental feature of tissues and organs. It is essential for the formation of specific cell-cell contacts, the formation of tight junctions (TJs) and the establishment of cell-cell asymmetry. The TJs form a selective diffusion barrier between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains and are involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. The establishment of cell-cell asymmetry is achieved by the segregation of membrane proteins into apical and basolateral membrane domains. The basolateral membrane is in contact with the extracellular matrix, the apical membrane is in contact with the environment. The formation of cell-cell contacts and the establishment of cell polarity are under the control of cell adhesion molecules and of cell-cell adhesion molecules. Cell adhesion molecules are involved in the initial step of cell-cell adhesion. They interact with the extracellular matrix and with other cells. Cell-cell adhesion molecules interact with each other and with the cytoskeleton. The formation of cell-cell contacts and the establishment of cell polarity are under the control of cell adhesion molecules.",
  "Hypertrophy is a compensatory response to increased hemodynamic load that is accompanied by an increase in the size of the cardiac myocytes. The increase in cell size is brought about by an increase in the size of the individual proteins (i.e., protein synthesis) with no change in the number of cells (i.e., cell proliferation is not involved). The increase in cell size is brought about by an increase in the amount of protein that is being synthesized without a change in the rate of protein degradation. The increase in protein synthesis is brought about by an increase in the translation of existing mRNAs into protein. The increase in protein synthesis is brought about by an increase in the activity of the translation initiation factor eIF-2. The increase in eIF-2 activity is brought about by a decrease in the activity of the eIF-2 inhibitor, eIF-2B. The increase in eIF-2B activity is brought about by a decrease in the activity of the eIF-2B inhibitor, GSK-3. The increase in eIF-2 activity is brought about by the phosphorylation of eIF-2 by a protein kinase called CaM Kinase III. The increase in eIF-2 activity is also brought about by the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 by a protein kinase called RSK. The increase in eIF-2 and ribosomal protein S6 activity is brought about by the phosphorylation of the initiation factor 4E by the kinase called MNK1. The increase in eIF-2 and ribosomal protein S6 activity is brought about by the phosphorylation of the initiation factor 4E by the kinase called MNK1.",
  "The heme group is an essential cofactor in many proteins. The heme group is synthesized from glycine and succinyl CoA by a series of enzymatic steps. The first step is the condensation of glycine and succinyl CoA to form porphobilinogen. This is followed by four enzymatic steps to form uroporphyrinogen III. This is converted to coproporphyrinogen III by two enzymatic steps. Coproporphyrinogen III is converted to protoporphyrinogen by the addition of a fourth ring. The heme group is attached to a protein carrier by a covalent bond. The final step in the synthesis of heme is the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme. The iron is inserted by ferrochelatase. The first step in the synthesis of heme is the activation of glycine by the enzyme ALA synthase. There are two forms of the enzyme in mammals, ALAS1 and ALAS2. ALAS1 is the housekeeping form and is expressed in all tissues. ALAS2 is a product of a specific erythroid gene and is expressed only in erythroid cells. The activity of ALAS is regulated by heme and succinyl CoA. Heme feedback inhibits the activity of ALAS. The activity of ALAS is also regulated by the level of succinyl CoA. When the level of succinyl CoA is high, the activity of the enzyme is increased. The activity of ferrochelatase is also regulated by heme. When the level of heme is high, the activity of ferrochelatase is increased.",
  "Rho family GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. In their active state, Rho GTPases interact with downstream effectors to regulate a variety of cellular processes including cytoskeletal reorganization, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho proteins by stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP, whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rho by stimulating the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. The Dbl family of GEFs is one group of proteins that activate Rho GTPases by stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP. The Dbl family of Rho GEFs includes Lbc, Vav, and Tiam1. The Dbl family also includes Dbl, P-Rex, Vav-2, and TrioD1. The Dbl homology (DH) domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of Dbl family GEFs, and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is involved in the localization of Dbl family proteins to the plasma membrane and in the regulation of the exchange activity of the DH domain. The DBL-homology (DH) domain is also found in the Bcr protein, which is involved in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The Dbl family also includes the Dbs and Vav proteins. The Dbs protein is involved in the development of multiple myeloma. The Vav protein is involved in T cell activation and is involved in the development of lymphoma and leukemia. The DBL protein is involved in the development of Wilms' tumors. The TrioD1 protein is involved in the development of the heart. The Lbc protein is involved in the development of a variety of tissues. The Dbl protein is involved in the development of leukemia. The P-Rex protein is involved in the development of myeloproliferative disorders. The Vav protein is involved in the development of lymphoma and leukemia. The Bcr protein is involved in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The Dia proteins are involved in the development of brain and skeletal abnormalities. The Dia-1 protein is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology. The Dia-2 protein is involved in the regulation of gene transcription.",
  "Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that is involved in the differentiation of B cells and T cells. The IL-4 receptor is a heterodimer, with the IL-4Ralpha chain being the ligand binding subunit and the IL-2Rgamma chain being the common gamma chain for the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13 and IL-15 receptors. The IL-4Ralpha chain is also the site of recruitment of JAK kinases for activation of the JAK / STAT pathway. The JAK kinases are a family of tyrosine kinases that are activated by cytokine receptors and are involved in the JAK / STAT signaling pathway. The JAK kinases phosphorylate the IL-4Ralpha chain and the IL-2Rgamma chain, creating binding sites for the STAT transcription factors. The STAT factors are activated by phosphorylation by the JAK kinases, and then translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription. The JAK / STAT pathway is involved in a variety of cellular responses, including differentiation of cells, proliferation and apoptosis.",
  "The GPI-anchor is a post-translational modification that anchors a diverse class of proteins to the cell surface. The GPI anchor is synthesized in the ER membrane from a phosphatidylinositol (PI) -tailed protein, a process termed GPI-anchor biosynthesis. The GPI-anchor precursor is first assembled on the ER membrane by the GPI-anchor biosynthetic pathway on the lipid-modified glycan, GlcN-acyl-1'phosphatidylinositol (GlcNAc-PI). After its attachment to the protein, the GPI-anchor precursor is transferred en bloc to the phosphatidylinositol-glycan (PI-G), the second GPI intermediate, by the GPI-transamidase complex. The GPI-anchor precursor is then deacetylated by an inositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) in the lumen of the ER, releasing the GPI-anchored protein from the membrane. The mature GPI-anchor precursor is then transferred to the target proteins in the lumen of the ER by an as yet unidentified glycolipid transporter. Defects in GPI-anchor biosynthesis cause a group of inherited disorders, the 'PIGA-related disorders'.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite produced by sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1). S1P is a ligand for five GPCRs, Edg-1, Edg-5, SPP-1R, SPP-2R and LPAR-3. S1P has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. In addition, S1P has been shown to play an important role in inflammation. S1P is produced in the plasma membrane from sphingomyelin by the action of acid sphingomyelinase. S1P is exported out of cells and is taken back up by cells through specific transporters. S1P is degraded to phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal by S1P lyase.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The binding of ligand to the extracellular domain results in receptor dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase domain. The downstream signaling pathways activated by EGFR activation include the ras / raf / mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway. These pathways ultimately result in enhanced cell proliferation, survival, and motility. Mutations in the EGFR gene have been identified in a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and are associated with a more favorable response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib. EGFR gene amplification and protein overexpression are also associated with a more favorable response to EGFR TKIs. The presence of EGFR gene mutations, EGFR gene amplification, and EGFR protein overexpression may be used to select patients with NSCLC who are most likely to respond to EGFR TKIs. Mutations in the EGFR kinase domain are associated with a higher response rate to EGFR TKIs. Mutations in the K-ras gene are associated with primary resistance to EGFR TKIs. The presence of EGFR mutations may also be used to select patients with NSCLC who are most likely to respond to EGFR TKIs.",
  "The inflammatory response is a complex process involving the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation, the release of inflammatory mediators, and the clearance of infectious agents. The inflammatory response is initiated by the recognition of foreign pathogens by pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR activation leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-12, IL-15, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha, and the induction of interferon-beta (IFN-beta). The production of these cytokines is regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is activated by TLR signaling. The recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes to the site of inflammation is regulated by chemokines, small chemoattractant cytokines that are induced by the inflammatory cytokines. The chemokines IL-8 and MIP-1 are potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and macrophages, respectively. The inflammatory response is terminated by the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-1RA, and IL-13. The anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 and IL-1RA are mediated in part by the inhibition of the production of inflammatory cytokines by activated macrophages. The balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines produced during an inflammatory response is an important determinant of the severity of an inflammatory response. Aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, including septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled cell suicide mechanism that plays a critical role in development and tissue homeostasis. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are responsible for the execution phase of apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors and are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are the two apical caspases that respond to apoptotic stimuli. Caspase-8 is activated by the Fas receptor and the cytochrome c / Apaf-1 / caspase-9 pathway. Caspase-9 is activated by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Once activated, caspase-3, -6 and-7 are the downstream effector caspases that cleave cellular targets that are essential for cell survival. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates apoptosis through their interactions with the caspases. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit apoptosis by blocking the activation of caspases, whereas Bax and Bid promote apoptosis by a similar mechanism.",
  "Hypoxia is a reduction in tissue oxygen tension that can occur in a number of settings, including ischemia, high altitude, and cancer. Cells respond to hypoxia by increasing the expression of genes that increase oxygen delivery, such as erythropoietins, and decrease the expression of genes that reduce oxygen delivery, such as erythropoietins and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The erythropoietin gene is activated by hypoxia through the coordinate action of a hypoxia-inducible enhancer (HRE) and a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE). The HRE binds the transcription factor HIF1, which is a heterodimer of HIF-1alpha and ARNT. The HIF-1alpha subunit is regulated by oxygen tension in cells, and is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions, but is stabilized and activated in hypoxia. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) binds to HIF-1alpha in an oxygen-dependent manner, targeting it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. The binding of VHL to HIF-1alpha is inhibited by the interaction of the elongin complex with HIF-1alpha, allowing HIF-1alpha to accumulate under hypoxic conditions. The binding of HIF-1alpha to ARNT also requires oxygen, and is inhibited by the interaction of HIF-1alpha with the p300 protein. The CRE in the erythropoietin gene binds CREB and ATF family members, and is required for full hypoxia responsiveness. The interaction of HIF-1alpha with CBP / p300 is also required for full erythropoietin induction by hypoxia. The interaction of HIF-1alpha with the elongin complex may also be involved in the inhibition of transcription by hypoxia. The interaction of HIF-1alpha with the p300 protein may also play a role in the transcriptional activation of other genes by HIF-1, such as VEGF. The inhibition of p300 by HIF-1alpha may also play a role in other HIF-1-dependent processes, such as apoptosis.",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell-fate specification. It is involved in a variety of developmental processes, including neurogenesis, myogenesis, and hematopoiesis. The Notch receptor is activated by Delta or Jagged ligands on the surface of an adjacent cell. Upon ligand binding, the Notch receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released. The NICD translocates to the nucleus and forms a transcriptional activation complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1 / Su (H) / Lag-1) and the coactivator Mastermind (MAM). This complex activates the transcription of Notch target genes, including those involved in cell fate specification. The Notch pathway is also involved in oncogenesis. The Notch pathway is constitutively activated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) by mutation of the Notch receptor or of the proteins involved in the Notch signaling cascade.",
  "Protein ubiquitination plays a key role in a variety of cellular processes, including protein degradation, endocytosis, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and stress signaling. E3 ubiquitin ligases determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitination. There are two major types of E3 ligases: HECT-type and RING-finger-type E3s. HECT-type E3s have a catalytic cysteine residue that accepts ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and transfers it to the substrate. The RING-finger-type E3s do not have a catalytic cysteine residue but bind both the ubiquitin-charged E2 and the substrate.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled cell death mechanism that is essential for proper embryonic development and tissue homeostasis in adult organisms. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are essential for apoptosis. Caspases are activated through two main pathways, the extrinsic (receptor-mediated) and the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the binding of extracellular death ligands to cell surface receptors. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, and ligation of cell surface receptors. Both pathways result in the activation of caspase-9, which in turn activates downstream caspases, including caspase-3. The cleavage of cellular substrates by caspases results in the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis.",
  "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and in the brain. They are also expressed in a variety of non-neuronal tissues, where their function is less well understood. The neuromuscular junction is a model system for the study of synapse formation and plasticity. At the neuromuscular junction, the motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle fiber. The binding of ACh opens a channel in the receptor, allowing influx of Na + and Ca2 + into the muscle fiber. The influx of cations depolarizes the muscle fiber and activates voltage-dependent calcium channels. The influx of calcium activates signaling pathways that lead to the formation of new acetylcholine receptors and other proteins at the neuromuscular junction. Nicotinic receptors are also expressed in the brain, where they modulate the release of dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Nicotinic receptors are also expressed in non-neuronal tissues, where their function is less well understood. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor is expressed in the thymus and may modulate the immune system. The alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor is expressed in the lung and is the target of the drug nicotine used to treat tobacco dependence.",
  "Cytokines are soluble factors that are secreted by cells in the body and that act on other cells.

The cytokines are classified into different groups based on their structure and function. The hematopoietic cytokines are a group of cytokines that stimulate the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The hematopoietic cytokines include the interleukins, colony stimulating factors, and the pentraxins.",
  "Tight junctions (TJs) are specialized cell-cell adhesion structures that regulate the passage of solutes and particles through the paracellular space between epithelial cells. TJs are formed by the association of transmembrane proteins with cytoplasmic plaque proteins. The transmembrane proteins occludin and claudins are the principal components of TJs. The cytoplasmic plaque contains several proteins that are involved in the regulation of TJ assembly and function. These include the zonula occludens proteins ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3, which are involved in the organization of the membrane proteins into a stable complex, and the multi-PDZ protein MUPP1, which may serve as a scaffold for the assembly of other proteins. Other cytoplasmic plaque proteins are cingulin, 73kDa protein, and AF-6. Cingulin and AF-6 are involved in the regulation of the assembly of TJs. 73kDa protein is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.",
  "T cells are activated by the T cell receptor (TCR) -major histocompatibility complex (MHC) interaction and by costimulatory molecules. Engagement of the TCR by antigen-bound MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) leads to T cell activation. The costimulatory signal is provided by interaction of the T cell receptor with costimulatory molecules on the APC. Engagement of the TCR and costimulatory molecules induces a signaling cascade that results in T cell proliferation and differentiation into effector cells. The strength and duration of the signal are critical for T cell activation. T cell activation is regulated by a delicate balance between positive and negative signals. T cell activation requires a positive signal provided by the TCR and costimulatory molecules. T cell activation is also regulated by a negative signal provided by various mechanisms, including coinhibitory molecules. Coinhibitory molecules are expressed on T cells and bind to their ligands on APCs. T cell activation is also regulated by the cytokine environment. T helper (Th) cells are classified into two subsets based on their cytokine profiles and functions. Th1 cells produce interleukin (IL) -2, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and are involved in cellular immunity. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 and are involved in humoral immunity. CD4 0 ligand (CD40L) is a costimulatory molecule that is expressed on activated T cells and that is required for Th2 cell differentiation.",
  "Macrophages are cells of the immune system that respond to infection and injury by ingesting and destroying foreign cells and tissues. Macrophages secrete a variety of factors that stimulate the immune response, including the cytokines that stimulate the growth and differentiation of other cells of the immune system. Macrophages also secrete reactive oxygen species that are toxic to cells and tissues. Cytokines are proteins or glycoproteins secreted by macrophages that act on other cells to elicit a response. Macrophages are activated by different factors to produce different cytokines. Interferon-gamma activates macrophages to secrete interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and other cytokines.

  "Cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) are important structures that regulate cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity. At AJs, homophilic interactions between the extracellular domains of E-cadherins lead to the formation of a zipper-like structure between cells. At TJs, occludin, claudins, and junction adhesion molecules (JAMs) interact with the cytoplasmic proteins ZO-1, -2, and -2, which in turn bind to the cytoplasmic domain of occludin and claudin. These interactions are thought to be important for the formation and maintenance of TJs. The formation of AJs and TJs is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Several protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been implicated in the regulation of AJs and TJs. The PTK c-Src is a key regulator of both AJs and TJs. Overexpression of c-Src in epithelial cells disrupts AJs and TJs, whereas inhibition of c-Src activity has the opposite effect. The disruption of AJs and TJs by Src is mediated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin, occludin, and ZO-1. The phosphorylation of these proteins by Src disrupts their interactions and their localization at AJs and TJs. The activity of c-Src is regulated by several mechanisms. The activity of c-Src is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue, Y5 2 7, in the kinase domain of c-Src. Dephosphorylation of Y5 2 7 by PTPs such as PTP-1B and PTP-LAR is required for the activation of c-Src. The activity of c-Src is also regulated by its interaction with other proteins. The interaction of c-Src with FAK is required for the activation of c-Src by integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The interaction of c-Src with cortactin also positively regulates the activity of c-Src. The disruption of AJs and TJs by Src is also mediated by the phosphorylation of cortactin. The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Src disrupts the interaction of cortactin with ZO-1 and ZO-2, which leads to the disruption of TJs.",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilatation and impaired contractility of the left or both ventricles, with a clinical presentation of heart failure. The incidence of DCM is approximately one in 25 0 0, and the prevalence is approximately 1 in 10 0 0. The clinical course is usually progressive, with a high mortality rate in the absence of heart transplantation. The cause of DCM is heterogeneous, with genetic factors being the most important. The genetic causes of DCM are heterogeneous, with mutations in at least 1 0 genes identified to date. These genes encode proteins that are involved in the maintenance of cytoskeletal structure, force-generating systems, and force transmission. The diagnosis of DCM is based on clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic findings. The prognosis of patients with DCM is poor, with a high mortality rate in the absence of heart transplantation. The treatment of patients with DCM is challenging, and the optimal approach is still under debate. Key issues include the identification of high-risk patients, the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and the role of heart transplantation.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is a multimeric receptor complex expressed on the surface of T cells that plays a central role in the immune system by recognizing specific peptide antigens associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. The TCR complex is composed of two polypeptide chains, the clonotypic alpha and beta chains that noncovalently associate with the invariant gamma and delta chains. The CD3 complex is associated with the TCR complex and is required for signal transduction. Engagement of the TCR by antigen induces a complex series of signaling events that result in T cell activation. The CD3 complex contains the invariant gamma and delta chains and two variable chains, alpha and beta, that associate with the gamma and beta chains to form a complex that is noncovalently associated with the TCR. The CD3 complex is responsible for transducing the TCR-derived activation signal. The TCR-CD3 complex is associated with tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk families that are activated by TCR engagement and phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the cytoplasmic domains of the TCR-associated CD3 and TCR-zeta chains. The phosphorylation of ITAMs creates binding sites for the Syk / ZAP-7 0 family of proteins that are also associated with the TCR-CD3 complex. The activation of these kinases results in the phosphorylation of downstream targets, including phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), LAT, Vav, and other proteins, that are required for T cell activation.",
  "The mitotic spindle is a macromolecular machine that segregates chromosomes during cell division. The mitotic spindle is composed of microtubules and associated proteins. The activity of the mitotic spindle is regulated by the cell cycle, and by the cell's environment. The cell cycle regulates the activity of the mitotic spindle by controlling the assembly and disassembly of microtubules, and by regulating the activity of microtubule associated proteins. The cell's environment regulates the activity of the mitotic spindle by controlling the concentration of free tubulin dimers. The concentration of free tubulin dimers is regulated by the levels of free tubulin monomers, which are in turn regulated by the opposing activities of polymerization and depolymerization. The activity of microtubule associated proteins is regulated by phosphorylation, and by the concentration of free tubulin monomers.",
  "Mitochondria play a central role in the apoptotic pathway. The release of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm triggers the caspase cascade and the downstream destruction of the cell. The release of mitochondrial proteins is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The Bcl-2 family can be divided into three groups. The anti-apoptotic proteins include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, A1, and Mcl-1. The pro-apoptotic proteins can be further divided into two groups. The first group includes Bax and Bak, which are required for apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including the release of mitochondrial proteins. The second group includes Bid, Bim, Bad, Bik, Puma, Noxa, and Htra2. These proteins share homology in one region, the BH3 domain. When activated, these BH3-containing proteins can interact with Bcl-2 family members to either promote apoptosis or sensitize cells to apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins block apoptosis by binding to the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and preventing them from inducing apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family members are localized to the mitochondrial membrane, the only known site at which they exert their effects. The release of mitochondrial proteins is regulated by the Bcl-2 family. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential and prevent the release of mitochondrial proteins. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins like Bax and Bak induce the release of mitochondrial proteins by forming pores in the mitochondrial membrane. The release of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm activates caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that are required for apoptosis. Caspases are produced as inactive zymogens and are activated by cleavage. Caspases cleave cellular targets in a defined sequence and the destruction of these targets contributes to the morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Caspases include caspase-8, -9, and -3. Caspase-8 is activated by the Fas receptor and the adaptor protein FADD. Caspase-9 is activated by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Caspase-9 cleaves and activates caspase-3. IAP proteins block apoptosis by binding to caspases and preventing them from being activated. IAP proteins are antagonized by Smac / Diablo, a mitochondrial protein released into the cytoplasm during apoptosis.",
  "The development of cancer is a multistep process that involves the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes contribute to the development of cancer. The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. The Rb protein is involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. The Rb protein binds to the transcription factor E2F and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Inactivation of the Rb gene leads to the loss of Rb protein and the release of free E2F. The free E2F then activates genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The activation of oncogenes such as c-MYC also contributes to the development of cancer by deregulating the cell cycle and apoptosis. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes contribute to the development of cancer.",
  "TrkA is a receptor tyrosine kinase for NGF. The binding of NGF to TrkA activates several signaling pathways, including the Ras / Map kinase pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. The activation of these pathways leads to neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth.",
  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVD) is a heart muscle disease that predominantly affects young adults. It is characterized by progressive loss of ventricular myocytes, replacement by fat and fibrous tissue, and is the most common cause of SCD in young adults in industrialized countries. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive modes of inheritance. Mutations in the desmosomal genes (DSP, JUP, PKP) have been identified in patients with ARVD. Desmosomes are intercellular junctions that provide strong mechanical coupling between adjacent cardiomyocytes. The desmosomal proteins include plakoglobin (PG), plakophilin (PKP), desmoplakin (DSP), desmocolin (DSC), and desmoglein (DSG). Desmosomes are also important in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Mutations in these genes may lead to a loss of cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal disorganization, which may be responsible for the myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement. The identification of mutations in the desmosomal genes in patients with ARVD provides strong support for the desmosome hypothesis of ARVD pathogenesis.",
  "Interleukin-1 2 (IL-1 2) is a heterodimeric cytokine that is produced by activated macrophages and dendritic cells and stimulates the proliferation and activation of T cells. The IL-1 2 heterodimer is composed of p3 5 and p4 0 chains that are encoded by separate genes. The IL-1 2 receptor is a heterodimer and is composed of two chains, a ligand-binding chain (IL-1 2Rbeta1) and a signal-transducing chain (IL-1 2Rbeta2). IL-1 2 stimulates T cells to proliferate and produce cytokines such as IFN-gamma and IL-2. The IL-1 2 receptor is expressed on T cells, NK cells, and some B cells. IL-1 2 stimulates T cells and NK cells to proliferate and produce IFN-gamma and IL-2. The IL-1 2 receptor is also expressed on some B cells and is required for IL-1 2-induced B cell proliferation and the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Mice lacking IL-1 2 or IL-1 2 receptor are impaired in their ability to generate Th1 cells and are susceptible to intracellular infections. The IL-1 2 receptor is also required for the development of protective Th1 cells in humans. The IL-1 2 receptor is a member of the JAK-STAT receptor family and signals through the JAK kinases and STAT transcription factors. Binding of IL-1 2 to the receptor causes the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and Tyk2 and the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 and STAT4. The IL-1 2 receptor is not down-regulated by IL-1 2 and is not down-regulated by IFN-gamma, but the response of cells to IL-1 2 is sustained by IL-1 2. The IL-1 2 receptor is induced on T cells by activation and is maintained on activated T cells.",
  "NK cells are lymphocytes that are distinct from B and T cells in their origin, receptors, and function. NK cells are involved in innate immunity through the secretion of cytokines and lysis of virus-infected and tumor cells. NK cells are also involved in the regulation of adaptive immune responses through the regulation of T cells. NK cells express a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors that regulate their activation and cytotoxicity. Inhibitory receptors include killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLR) that bind to MHC-I molecules on target cells. Activating receptors include natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) that bind to ligands such as MICA and MICB. The balance of activating and inhibitory signals determines the activation state of the NK cell. The protein tyrosine kinase SYK is an essential component of the NK cell activation pathway. The tyrosine kinase ZAP7 0 is also involved in NK cell activation, but is not essential for NK cell cytotoxicity. The LAT adaptor protein is involved in NK cell activation and is phosphorylated by SYK and ZAP7 0. The small GTPase RAC is also involved in NK cell activation. The integrin LFA-1 is involved in NK cell cytotoxicity and may play a role in the formation of an NK cell immunological synapse.",
  "Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates the D3 position of inositol ring of phosphoinositides. PI3K is activated by a variety of growth factors and regulates a variety of cellular responses, including cell growth, survival, and motility. The activation of PI3K is negatively regulated by PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 1 0), a tumor suppressor gene. The activation of PI3K leads to the activation of AKT, also known as protein kinase B. AKT is a serine / threonine kinase that regulates a variety of cellular processes through phosphorylation of downstream targets. AKT inhibits apoptosis through phosphorylation and inactivation of the caspase-9 and BAD proteins. AKT also phosphorylates and inactivates the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, leading to the inhibition of apoptosis through the upregulation of the survival gene products like manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). AKT also phosphorylates and activates the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamcyin) kinase, leading to an increase in translation. AKT activation also leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3, a kinase that phosphorylates and regulates the phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Beta-catenin is a component of the Wnt signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin by GSK-3 leads to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome. The inhibition of GSK-3 by AKT leads to the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with the transcription factors of the TCF / LEF family to activate transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of reactions that leads to the formation of a clot at the site of injury. The clotting cascade can be divided into three phases: the extrinsic activation phase, the intrinsic activation phase and the clot formation phase. The extrinsic phase begins with damage to the vascular wall or exposure of blood to a foreign surface. This causes the release of tissue factor (TF), a membrane protein expressed on the surface of cells, which activates the clotting cascade by binding to factor VII and activating factor X. Once activated, factor X is rapidly converted to factor Xa, which cleaves prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the main component of the clot. The clot is then stabilized by factor XIII, which cross-links the fibrin monomers. The intrinsic activation phase is triggered by contact of blood with the vascular wall or with a foreign surface. This phase is activated by the intrinsic pathway, which is triggered by the presence of negatively charged phospholipids in the membrane of activated platelets. The intrinsic pathway is also activated by thrombin, which cleaves factor VIII and releases the activation peptide from factor VIIIa. Activated factor VIIIa binds to factor IXa to form the Xase complex, which activates factor X in the presence of calcium. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are closely linked and interact to form a balanced system. The clot formation phase is triggered by thrombin, which cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin. The fibrin monomers are cross-linked by factor XIII.",
  "Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted signaling protein that plays a key role in development of the central nervous system and other tissues. In the developing cerebellum, Shh secreted by the Purkinje cells acts on the granule cell precursor (GCP) cells in the external granule layer (EGL) to stimulate their proliferation. In the absence of Shh, the GCP cells continue to proliferate and migrate into the internal granule layer (IGL). The proliferation of the GCP cells is regulated by Shh through the activation of the Shh receptor Patched (Ptc). Binding of Shh to Ptc relieves inhibition of the Shh receptor Smoothened (Smo), which in turn activates a signaling pathway that includes the transcription factor Gli. The downstream targets of Shh signaling include cyclin D and N-myc. The regulation of GCP proliferation by Shh is essential for proper development of the cerebellum. Shh signaling also plays a role in the proliferation of other cell types, including some types of cancer. Inhibition of Shh signaling may provide a strategy for the treatment of some cancers.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a mitogen that stimulates proliferation of skeletal muscle cells. IGF-1 binds to its receptor, activating the receptor tyrosine kinase and initiating a signaling cascade that includes the ras / MAPK pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway. The ras / MAPK pathway is involved in the stimulation of proliferation by IGF-1, while the PI3 kinase pathway is involved in the stimulation of differentiation. The transcription factor NFAT is activated by IGF-1 and is involved in the stimulation of differentiation by IGF-1. The activity of NFAT is regulated by phosphorylation, with phosphorylation resulting in inhibition of NFAT activity. Protein phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, activating it and allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and regulate gene expression. Calcineurin is activated by calcium and calmodulin, and is inhibited by the immunophilin FKBP1 2. Rapamycin inhibits the activation of NFAT by IGF-1, indicating that the activation of NFAT by IGF-1 is mediated by the PI3 kinase pathway. The inhibition of NFAT activation by rapamycin indicates that another target of the PI3 kinase pathway is involved in the activation of NFAT by IGF-1.",
  "Rho family GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states. In their active GTP-bound state, Rho proteins interact with a variety of downstream effectors to regulate a variety of cellular processes including actin cytoskeletal organization, gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and membrane trafficking. Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and are deactivated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) maintain Rho proteins in their inactive GDP-bound state. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho proteins by catalyzing the release of GDP and the binding of GTP. GAPs inactivate Rho proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity, which promotes their dissociation from the membrane and their subsequent degradation in the cytosol. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) maintain Rho proteins in their inactive, membrane-associated state. Phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is required for the dissociation of Rho from the GDI and for the subsequent activation of Rho by GEFs. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) is a Rho effector that phosphorylates PIP2 to generate phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Rho effectors include the Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK), the Diaphanous-related formins (Dia), and the protein kinase N (PKN). ROCK and Dia regulate the actin cytoskeleton and membrane blebbing, while PKN regulates gene transcription. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin and regulates cell adhesion. Talin also binds to vinculin, which also binds to actin and regulates cell adhesion. The interaction of these three proteins (Rho, Talin, and Vinculin) is required for the formation of focal adhesions. Talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin and activates signaling through Rho and ROCK. Vinculin binds to talin and also binds to actin, bringing them together to form a complex that regulates cell adhesion.",
  "The HTLV-1 virus causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), an aggressive CD4 + T-cell malignancy. The viral protein Tax plays a central role in cellular transformation by HTLV-1. Tax interacts with a variety of cellular factors and alters their function. One of the most important of these is the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Tax interacts with p53 and increases its stability. Tax also increases the transcriptional activity of p53. The p53 protein is a transcription factor that can both activate and repress transcription. Tax interaction with p53 alters the cellular functions of p53. One of the genes activated by p53 is the gene for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p15. Tax activation of p53 causes a G2 cell cycle arrest and a subsequent increase in apoptosis. Another target of p53 is the gene for the tumor suppressor gene p16. Tax activation of p53 also represses the expression of the Fas cell surface receptor. Tax activation of p53 also activates NFkB, a transcription factor that plays a key role in inflammation and immune responses. Tax activation of NFkB causes resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF.",
  "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are part of the immune system and play a key role in the defense against viral infections and tumor cells. CTLs and NK cells release perforin and granzyme proteins into the target cell to induce apoptosis. Perforin forms pores in the cell membrane allowing the granzyme proteins to enter the cell and activate caspases and nucleases. The caspases and nucleases cleave cellular components, leading to the breakdown of the cell and the death of the cell. The granzyme proteins are a family of proteases that enter the cell through the perforin pore and activate caspases and nucleases. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that are activated during apoptosis and cleave cellular targets to induce cell death. The caspases include caspase-1 (also known as IL-1beta convertase), caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-4, caspase-5, caspase-6, and caspase-8 (also known as FLICE). The granzyme proteases activate caspases directly or indirectly. The caspases cleave and activate other caspases to amplify the apoptotic signal. The nucleases involved in apoptosis include DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) and endonuclease G (EndoG). DFF is activated by caspase-3 and caspase-7 and translocates to the nucleus to induce DNA fragmentation. EndoG is a nuclease that is released from the mitochondria during apoptosis and translocates to the nucleus to induce DNA fragmentation.",
  "Taste perception is mediated by taste receptors, which are expressed on the apical surface of taste cells. Five distinct families of taste receptors have been identified: T1R (umami), T2R (bitter), T4R (sweet), T6P (amino acids), and T6S (sour). Each of these families is represented by a large number of genes. Each family of receptors has a distinct structure and mechanism of activation. The T1R family is composed of metabotropic receptors, which are coupled to G proteins. The T1R family is composed of two subunits, T1R1 and T1R2, which form a heterodimer. T1R1 has been suggested to be the umami taste receptor, while T1R2 is involved in umami and sweet tasting. The T2R family is composed of metabotropic receptors, which are coupled to gustducin. The T2R family is composed of bitter taste receptors, which are divided into two subfamilies, TAS1R and TAS2R. The T2R family of receptors is also divided into two subfamilies, TAS1Rs and TAS2Rs. The T2R family of receptors is coupled to gustducin, while the T1R family is coupled to the G protein gustducin. The T4R family is composed of receptors for amino acids. The T6P family is composed of receptors for amino acids and is coupled to the G protein subunit GNAT3. The T6S family is composed of a receptor for protons.",
  "The calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM KII) is a multifunctional protein kinase that is expressed in all eukaryotic cells. It is activated by calcium and calmodulin. CaM KII is involved in a variety of cellular functions including learning and memory, muscle contraction, and gene expression. CaM KII is a tetramer composed of two subunits, each containing a catalytic domain, a regulatory domain, and a calmodulin binding domain. The CaM KII holoenzyme is inactive in the absence of calcium and calmodulin. Calcium binding to calmodulin causes a conformational change in the enzyme, releasing the catalytic and regulatory domains to interact and phosphorylate substrates. CaM KII is autophosphorylated at three sites in the regulatory domain, which increases the activity of the kinase. The autophosphorylation of CaM KII is a calcium-dependent process. Autophosphorylation of CaM KII at the Thr-3 0 5 site causes a 1 0-fold increase in activity, while autophosphorylation at the CaM KII sites in the alpha and beta subunits causes a further 2-3-fold increase in activity. The autophosphorylation of CaM KII at Thr-3 0 5 is reversed by a protein phosphatase, calcineurin. The CaM KII alpha subunit is the predominant isoform in the brain. A closely related kinase, CaM KIV, is also regulated by calcium and calmodulin. CaM KIV is activated by the protein kinase CaMK-2, which is activated by CaM KII. CaM KIV is involved in the regulation of gene expression by calcium.",
  "The small G-protein RhoA is a molecular switch that regulates a variety of cellular functions, including cytoskeletal structure, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and membrane trafficking. RhoA is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which stimulate the release of GDP and its replacement with GTP. The intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA is stimulated by GAPs, which increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis. The downstream effectors of RhoA are serine / threonine kinases, including PKN, Rho-kinase, and mDia1, and the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). RhoA regulates SRF through the p0 0 7 1 family of transcriptional cofactors. The p0 0 7 1 family members are transcriptional coactivators that interact with the MADS-box transcription factors serum response factor (SRF) and MEF2A. The transcriptional activity of p0 0 7 1 is regulated by phosphorylation. RhoA activates PKN, which phosphorylates p0 0 7 1 and induces its dissociation from SRF. PKN also phosphorylates and activates the transcriptional cofactor MAL, which translocates to the nucleus and activates SRF and MEF2A. The p0 0 7 1 family members include p0 0 1, p0 0 3, and p0 0 2. The transcriptional activity of p0 0 7 1 is inhibited by its interaction with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor. The interaction of p0 0 7 1 with PML is disrupted by phosphorylation of p0 0 7 1 by PKN. The p0 0 7 1-PML interaction is also disrupted by phosphorylation of p0 0 7 1 by the MAPK pathway. The interaction of p0 0 7 1 with PML is required for the localization of p0 0 7 1 to nuclear bodies. The p0 0 7 1-PML interaction is disrupted by phosphorylation of p0 0 7 1 by the MAPK pathway. The interaction of p0 0 7 1 with PML is also disrupted by phosphorylation of PML by the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). The p38 SAPK is activated by stress signals, including osmotic shock, UV irradiation, and inflammatory cytokines. The disruption of the p0 0 7 1-PML interaction by phosphorylation of p0 0 7 1 and PML by p38 SAPK may allow p0 0 7 1 to activate SRF and MEF2A in response to stress signals.",
  "The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a large superfamily of membrane proteins that actively transport a wide variety of substrates across extra- and intra-cellular membranes using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. The human genome contains 4 8 genes that encode ABC transporters, which are classified into seven subfamilies (A-G) on the basis of their sequence similarities and phylogenetic relationships. The human erythrocyte membrane contains two major ABC transporters, the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) and the band 3 protein (AE1, SLC4A1). The MRP is encoded by the ABCC1 gene and is responsible for the transport of a broad spectrum of organic anions, including conjugated metabolites, GSH conjugates, and drugs and toxins. The band 3 protein is encoded by the SLC4A1 gene and is the major anion exchanger in erythrocytes. The structure of the band 3 protein is shown in Fig. 1. The structure of the MRP is shown in Fig. 2. The MRP is a multi-specific transporter that transports a broad spectrum of anionic compounds, including anionic drugs, toxins, and carcinogens, out of cells. The structure of the band 3 protein is shown in Fig. 3.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly coordinated sequence of events that results in the replication and segregation of chromosomes. The G1 phase of the cell cycle is the growth phase in which cells prepare for DNA replication. The restriction point controls the transition from G1 to S phase. The G1 to S phase transition is regulated by the interplay of several proteins, including the cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), and cdk inhibitors. The cyclins are regulatory subunits of the cdks, and the cdks are a family of serine-threonine kinases. The cyclins are expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner and activate the cdks at specific times in the cell cycle. The cdk inhibitors oppose the action of the cyclins and cdks to regulate the cell cycle. The cdk inhibitors include p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p15INK4c, and p27KIP1. The p16INK4a gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in human cancer. The cdk inhibitors oppose the action of the cyclins and cdks to regulate the cell cycle. The cdk inhibitors are expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner and inhibit the transition from G1 to S phase. The cdk-cyclin complexes phosphorylate the tumor suppressor Rb, releasing the transcription factor E2F. E2F activates genes involved in DNA synthesis. The TGF-beta signaling pathway also regulates the G1 to S phase transition. The TGF-beta receptor phosphorylates and activates smad 2 and 3, which form a complex with E2F and p53 to repress transcription of genes involved in DNA synthesis.",
  "The Raf / Mek / Erk kinase cascade is a key mediator of growth factor signaling. Growth factor receptors activate the small G protein Ras, which recruits Raf to the membrane where it is activated by phosphorylation. Raf phosphorylates and activates Mek1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates Erk1 and Erk2. Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylate transcription factors such as ELK-1 and fos, which regulate genes involved in cell proliferation. The p38 Map kinase cascade is also activated by growth factors and is involved in cell survival and proliferation. Mek1 and Mek2 are activated by the small G protein Raf1, which is activated by growth factor receptors and by the small G protein Rac. Mek1 and Mek2 phosphorylate and activate Erk1 and Erk2, which phosphorylate transcription factors such as ELK-1 and fos. The p38 Map kinase cascade is also involved in cell survival and proliferation. The importance of this pathway in cellular responses to growth factors has been demonstrated by the finding that mice lacking Mek1 are embryonic lethal and that mice lacking Erk1 or Erk2 die at mid-gestation. The Raf / Mek / Erk cascade is also involved in cellular responses to cytokines. The Jak / Stat pathway is activated by cytokines such as IL-2 and activates genes involved in cell survival and proliferation. The Stat proteins are phosphorylated by Jak kinases, which are activated by cytokine receptors. The Map kinase pathway is also involved in cellular responses to cytokines. The p38 Map kinase cascade is activated by the IL-2 receptor and activates transcription factors such as NF-AT and AP-1.",
  "TNF is a potent inflammatory cytokine that induces the expression of adhesion molecules and the production of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. The biological effects of TNF are mediated by two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR1 is expressed on most cells and mediates the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of TNF. TNFR2 is primarily expressed on cells of the hematopoietic lineage and mediates the inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects of TNF. Binding of TNF to TNFR1 or TNFR2 induces the recruitment of TRADD, TRAF2, RIP and the TAK1 / TAB1 kinase complex to the receptor. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RIP is required for TNF-induced NF-kB activation. The TAK1 / TAB1 kinase complex phosphorylates and activates the IKK complex, which phosphorylates the NF-kB inhibitor IkB and leads to its degradation. NF-kB is then free to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes.",
  "The mu opioid receptor (MOP-r) is a GPCR that is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand, enkephalins, and the synthetic opiate drugs morphine and fentanyl. The MOP-r is widely expressed in the nervous system and is involved in the regulation of pain, reward, and respiration. The receptor is a member of the rhodopsin-like GPCR family and couples to the Gi / o family of G proteins. The receptor is rapidly desensitized and down-regulated following activation by agonist. The receptor is phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs), which recruit beta-arrestins to the receptor, uncoupling the receptor from G protein and targeting it for internalization. The receptor is then dephosphorylated by an as yet unidentified phosphatase and is targeted to clathrin-coated pits for internalization. The receptor is then either recycled to the cell surface or targeted for degradation. The receptor is also regulated by other signaling pathways. The receptor is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), and activation of these kinases desensitizes the receptor. The receptor is also regulated by other GPCRs. The delta opioid receptor (DOP-r) is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand, deltorphin, and is also regulated by the MOP-r. The kappa opioid receptor (KOP-r) is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand, dynorphin, and is also regulated by the MOP-r. The regulation of the MOP-r by other GPCRs may be important in the development of tolerance to opiate drugs. The DOP-r is also regulated by the KOP-r, and the activation of the KOP-r may contribute to the development of tolerance to opiates.",
  "The zona pellucida (ZP) is a glycoprotein matrix surrounding the oocyte that is required for sperm to bind to the egg and undergo the acrosome reaction. The mouse egg contains three major glycoproteins (ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3) that form the zona pellucida. The genes for these proteins are closely linked on mouse chromosome 1E2. The ZP1 and ZP2 genes are separated by 1kb and the ZP3 gene is 1kb downstream of the ZP2 gene. The ZP3 gene is alternatively spliced to produce two different forms of ZP3, a secreted form and a membrane-bound form. The secreted form of ZP3 is the sperm receptor that triggers the acrosome reaction. The membrane-bound form of ZP3 is involved in egg-sperm adhesion. The mouse ZP3 gene is expressed in growing oocytes and its expression is regulated by the transcription factor Obox. The Obox binding site is also the binding site for the transcription factor Foxl2. Foxl2 is also expressed in growing oocytes and is required for ZP3 expression. The ZP3 gene is also activated by the transcription factors Nobox and Bmp1 5. The protein kinase C (PKC) pathway is involved in the regulation of ZP3 expression. The PKC activator PMA increases ZP3 expression, while the PKC inhibitor calphostin C reduces ZP3 expression. The PKC pathway also regulates the expression of other oocyte-specific genes. The transcription factor Nobox activates ZP3 expression, while Bmp1 5 represses ZP3 expression. The transcription factor AP-1 is involved in the regulation of other oocyte-specific genes. The AP-1 family member c-Fos represses ZP3 expression, while c-Jun activates ZP3 expression. The transcription factor Bmp1 5 also activates ZP3 expression. The PKC pathway may regulate the activity of AP-1.",
  "The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex that is highly conserved from yeast to man. It is activated by increases in the ratio of AMP to ATP within the cell, and so acts as an intracellular monitor of energy status. It is also activated by phosphorylation by an upstream kinase, which in mammals is a complex of three subunits, each of which is a member of a gene family. The AMPK kinase complex is activated by phosphorylation of a single threonine residue (Thr1 7 2 in the rat alpha2 subunit) within the catalytic subunit by an upstream kinase, which has been identified as a member of the protein kinase gene family, LKB1. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates and regulates several metabolic enzymes to increase glucose uptake and lipid oxidation, while switching off biosynthetic pathways, such as lipid and protein synthesis. Other effects of AMPK include inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and stimulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells.",
  "TNF is a cytokine that induces apoptosis in some cells. The cytotoxic effects of TNF are mediated by two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Binding of TNF to TNFR1 leads to the activation of NF-kB and apoptosis. Binding of TNF to TNFR2 does not activate NF-kB but can activate apoptosis. The cytotoxic effects of TNF are mediated by the activation of caspases. TNF can also activate the ASK1 kinase to activate the JNK kinase pathway and apoptosis. TNF can also activate the neutral sphingomyelinase to generate ceramide, which can activate apoptosis. TNF can activate the ASK1 kinase to activate the JNK kinase pathway and apoptosis. TNF can also activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through the induction of reactive oxygen species.",
  "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from benign adenomatous polyps through the accumulation of mutations in a variety of genes. Mutations in the APC gene occur early in tumor development and are found in the vast majority of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. APC is a multifunctional protein that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis through its interaction with beta-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling. Mutations in the APC gene also result in stabilization of beta-catenin, which leads to constitutive activation of the beta-catenin / T-cell factor (TCF) pathway. Mutations in the K-ras gene occur early in tumor development and are found in approximately 5 0% of colorectal cancers. The transforming activity of mutant K-ras is mediated through multiple effectors, including the Raf / MEK / ERK kinase cascade and the PI3K / AKT pathway. Mutations in the p53 gene are late events in colorectal tumorigenesis and are found in approximately 3 0% of colorectal cancers. The p53 gene product transcriptionally activates genes that induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, such as p16 and BTG.",
  "The Rho family of GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc4 2) are molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. In their inactive state, GTPases are bound to GDP and are sequestered in the cytosol by guanine-nucleotide-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Activation occurs when extracellular signals lead to the dissociation of the GTPase-GDI complex, membrane localization of the GTPase, and interaction with a specific set of downstream effectors. The downstream effectors transduce the signal to regulate cytoskeletal structure, gene transcription, and other cellular processes. The activity of Rho GTPases is regulated by a variety of factors, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). GEFs activate Rho proteins by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, GAPs inactivate Rho proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity, and GDIs inhibit the exchange of GDP for GTP and keep Rho proteins in their inactive state in the cytosol. The Dbl family of GEFs is characterized by the presence of a conserved Dbl homology (DH) domain and a less-conserved pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain is responsible for the GEF activity, and the PH domain may regulate the activity of the DH domain or may serve as a membrane-targeting module. The Dbl family includes several members that are specific for RhoA (Lbc, Lfc, Net1, and Net2), several that are specific for Rac1 (Tiam1, Vav1, and Vav3), and several that act on both RhoA and Rac1 (Dbl, Trio, and Kalirin). The Dbl family GEFs are regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including the presence of upstream activators, interaction with other proteins, and phosphorylation. The Dbl family GEFs are also negatively regulated by several factors, including RhoGDIs, and the RhoGAP proteins. The downstream effectors of Rho GTPases include several kinases, such as the p145 and p21 isoforms of the 38-kDa subunit of the initiation factor complex, p160 of the Arp2 / 3 complex, and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK). The p145 and p21 subunits of the initiation factor complex bind to the active form of Rho GTPases and stimulate their interaction with downstream effectors. The p160 of the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the inactive form of Rho and is released when the GTPases are activated. ROCK is a serine / threonine kinase that phosphorylates several targets, including myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and LIM kinase. The phosphorylation of myosin light chain by MLCK increases myosin-based contractility, while the phosphorylation of LIM kinase by ROCK inhibits the activity of cofilin, a protein that severs actin filaments and promotes their polymerization. Cofilin promotes actin depolymerization by increasing the availability of monomers for polymerization. The balance between actin polymerization and depolymerization is critical for many cellular processes, including cell motility, cytokinesis, and cell adhesion.",
  "DNA damage checkpoints are signaling pathways that respond to DNA damage to halt cell cycle progression and allow time for DNA repair to occur. The ATM protein kinase is a key component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway that responds to double-strand breaks in DNA. ATM phosphorylates downstream targets including the checkpoint kinase chk1 and the tumor suppressor p53. The checkpoint function of ATM is important for maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer. The ATR kinase also plays a key role in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. ATR is activated by single-stranded DNA that arises from DNA damage or during DNA replication. ATR phosphorylates chk1 and p53 in response to DNA damage and is required for the G2 / M checkpoint. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 is required for the G2 / M checkpoint. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 is also required for the intra-S phase checkpoint in response to DNA damage. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 is also required for resistance to DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation. The checkpoint function of ATR is important for maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 is also required for resistance to DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 is also required for resistance to DNA damaging agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 is also required for resistance to DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin. The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 is also required for resistance to DNA methylating agents such as N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). ATR is also required for resistance to ultraviolet light (UV). ATR is mutated in the cancer-prone disorder, Seckel syndrome. Cells from patients with Seckel syndrome are sensitive to DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, mitomycin C, cisplatin, MNNG and UV. The sensitivity of Seckel cells to DNA damaging agents may be caused by the role of ATR in maintaining genomic stability. The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is also required for resistance to DNA damaging agents. BRCA1 is required for the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 in response to DNA damage. The phosphorylation of chk1 and p53 by ATR is required for resistance to DNA damaging agents. The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 is also required for resistance to DNA damaging agents. BRCA2 interacts with chk1 and p53 in response to DNA damage. The interaction of BRCA2 with chk1 and p53 may be required for resistance to DNA damaging agents.",
  "Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature, is a complex, multi-step process that is essential for both the development and the repair of tissues. It is also a key factor in a number of pathological conditions including cancer, arthritis, and psoriasis. The process of angiogenesis is regulated by a balance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. The balance is altered in favor of angiogenesis in the presence of a tumor. The angiogenic switch is activated by a variety of factors, including growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hypoxia, and inflammatory cytokines. These factors activate several signaling pathways that converge on the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is a master regulator of angiogenesis that induces the expression of a number of genes involved in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. These genes include VEGF, FGF, PDGF, and ET-1. These factors stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and vascular permeability. The activation of endothelial cells also leads to the expression of adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteases, which are required for the invasion and migration of endothelial cells. The formation of new blood vessels allows the tumor to grow beyond a few millimeters in diameter without a vascular supply. The inhibition of angiogenesis has been shown to be an effective strategy for the treatment of cancer.",
  "Peroxisomes are essential for the metabolism of a wide variety of substrates, including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and fatty acid derivatives. The oxidation of fatty acids is the most important function of peroxisomes. The first step of fatty acid oxidation is the conversion of acyl-CoA to acyl-carnitine by carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (COT). Acyl-carnitine is then transported to the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Peroxisomes are also involved in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids, which are essential for the function of human lungs, heart, and blood clotting. The biosynthesis of ether phospholipids is initiated by the conversion of dihydroxyacetonephosphate to alkylglycerol phosphate by dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT). The next steps are the conversion of alkylglycerol phosphate to plasmenylethanolamine by ethanolamine phosphotransferase (EPT) and the conversion of plasmenylethanolamine to ethanolamine phosphate by vinyl ether transferase (VCT). The final product, platelet-activating factor, is then released from the membrane and plays an important role in blood clotting.",
  "Insulin binding to its receptor activates the receptor tyrosine kinase and leads to the activation of two major signaling pathways: the PI 3-kinase pathway and the MAPK pathway. The PI 3-kinase pathway leads to the activation of protein kinase B (also known as AKT) and its downstream effectors, including the mTOR (also known as RAFT or FRAP) pathway. The mTOR pathway regulates protein translation by phosphorylating the initiation factor 4E-BP1 and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase. The MAPK pathway leads to the activation of the ternary complex factor (TCF) and ELK-1. The TCF / ELK-1 pathway regulates genes involved in cell growth and proliferation.",
  "Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle is a series of eight reactions that takes place in the mitochondria and results in the production of NADH and FADH2 that are used in the electron transport chain to produce energy in the form of a high-energy phosphate bond. The Krebs cycle is also a major source of carbon skeletons for the biosynthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, and other important metabolites. The cycle begins with the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. This reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase. The next four reactions of the cycle are the condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA to form citrate. This reaction is catalyzed by citrate synthase. The next four reactions are the same as those in the first reaction of the glyoxylate cycle. The fifth reaction of the Krebs cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of citrate to produce alpha-ketoglutarate. This reaction is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase. The sixth reaction of the Krebs cycle is the condensation of two molecules of alpha-ketoglutarate to form succinyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The last reaction of the Krebs cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of succinyl-CoA to form fumarate and CO2. This reaction is catalyzed by fumarate hydratase. The electrons from the Krebs cycle are transferred to the electron transport chain to produce energy in the form of a high-energy phosphate bond. The transfer of electrons from the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain occurs via a series of redox reactions. The first reaction of the Krebs cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to form alpha-ketoglutarate. This reaction is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase. The next reactions of the cycle are the transfer of electrons to form NADH and FADH2. NADH is used in the electron transport chain to produce energy in the form of a high-energy phosphate bond. FADH2 is also an important electron carrier in the electron transport chain. The transfer of electrons from the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain is accomplished by a series of redox reactions. The transfer of electrons from succinate to the electron transport chain is accomplished by the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. This reaction is catalyzed by fumarate reductase. The transfer of electrons from the electron transport chain to the Krebs cycle is accomplished by succinate dehydrogenase. The transfer of electrons from the Krebs cycle to oxygen is accomplished by the cytochrome pathway. The transfer of electrons from oxygen to the electron transport chain is accomplished by the terminal oxidase of the electron transport chain.

  "S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the methyl group donor for most biological methylations. The methyl group is transferred from SAM to the -nitrogen of a substrate to form S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is then hydrolyzed to homocysteine and adenosine by the enzyme SAH hydrolase. Homocysteine is either remethylated to methionine or reduced to cysteine, which is used to synthesize glutathione. DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids are modified by methylation. DNA methylation is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression. Proteins can be modified by methylation of their lysine or arginine residues. Cysteine is the limiting amino acid in food. Cysteine is synthesized from serine by the enzyme serine transhydroxymethylase (SHMT). Cysteine is also derived from methionine. Methionine synthase transfers a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) to homocysteine to regenerate methionine. Methionine synthase is an important methyl group donor in remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The remethylation of homocysteine to methionine is an important process to maintain a constant level of methionine in cells. DNA methylation is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression.",

  "The central nervous system (CNS) is separated from the rest of the body by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized endothelial cell-cell tight junction (TJ) structure that restricts the free movement of solutes and macromolecules between the circulating blood and the brain. The presence of TJs restricts the paracellular diffusion of solutes and restricts the movement of solutes between the circulating blood and the brain parenchyma. TJs are composed of a number of integral membrane proteins and associated proteins, such as occludins, claudins, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). These integral membrane proteins and associated proteins form a complex network that seals the intercellular space. TJs are also involved in the regulation of cell polarity and cell signaling. Disruption of TJs is believed to be one of the initial steps in the pathogenesis of a number of CNS diseases, including brain edema, meningitis, and brain tumors.",
  "Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that binds GTP and GDP and is required for the formation of a ternary complex with methionyl-tRNA and the initiation of translation. Phosphorylation of eIF2 at Ser5 1 by a variety of kinases inhibits the formation of the ternary complex and thus protein synthesis. The heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), the general amino acid control kinase (GCN2), and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) are all activated by different forms of stress and phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF2. The phosphorylation of eIF2 by PKR and PERK is involved in the cellular response to viral infection and the unfolded protein response, respectively.

  "The adrenergic receptor / cAMP signaling pathway is a key regulator of cardiac function. Increased adrenergic signaling is a key component of heart failure. The downstream effects of cAMP signaling are mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). EPAC is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small G protein Rap1. EPAC is activated by the second messenger cAMP and couples cAMP signaling to the regulation of Rap1. Rap1 is a member of the Ras family of small GTPases that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation. The EPAC / Rap1 pathway is involved in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. The EPAC / Rap1 pathway is also involved in the regulation of calcium channels and calcium handling in the heart.

The regulation of calcium handling by the EPAC / Rap1 pathway may be involved in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy.",
  "The innate immune response is triggered by the recognition of conserved molecular patterns associated with pathogens. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a potent activator of the innate immune response. LPS is recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on the cell surface of immune cells and in the cytoplasm. LPS recognition by TLR4 initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of NF-kB and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1. The activation of NF-kB by LPS is mediated by the adaptor protein MyD8 8, which is also involved in signaling by IL-1 and IL-18. MyD8 8 interacts with IL-1R1 and IL-18R via the adaptor protein IRAK-1, which in turn interacts with TRAF6. TRAF6 activates the IKK complex, which phosphorylates I-kB, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of inflammatory genes. The activation of NF-kB by LPS and IL-1 is negatively regulated by the I-kB kinase complex member RIP. The activation of NF-kB by LPS and IL-1 is also negatively regulated by the SOCS family of proteins, which are induced by these cytokines and which interact with the IL-1R1 and TLR4 signaling complexes to inhibit further activation of NF-kB and the production of inflammatory cytokines. The activation of NF-kB by LPS and IL-1 is also negatively regulated by the TNF receptor associated factor family member TRAF6. TRAF-6 interacts with RIP and activates NF-kB signaling, but also interacts with SOCS-1 to inhibit further activation of NF-kB and the production of inflammatory cytokines.",

The interaction of CD24 7 with CD58 activates the JAK / STAT signaling pathway in eosinophils, causing them to secrete cytokines that cause inflammation.",
  "The complement system is a group of plasma proteins that are part of the immune system. The complement system is activated by three different pathways. The classical pathway is activated by antigen-antibody complexes, the alternative pathway is activated by bacterial infection, and the lectin pathway is activated by bacterial cell wall carbohydrates. Each of these pathways culminates in the formation of a C3 convertase that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The C3a fragment is a potent anaphylatoxin that stimulates inflammation, and the C3b fragment is a key component of the C3 convertase that activates the complement membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC causes osmotic lysis of cells and is also involved in opsonization of bacteria. The three pathways converge at the formation of the C3 convertase, which cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The alternative pathway is an amplification loop that is initiated by C3 convertase formation. The lectin pathway is activated by mannan binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins, which bind carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria. The binding of MBL or ficolins to bacteria activates the lectin pathway. The MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) -1 and MASP-2 are part of the lectin pathway. MASP-1 is a protease that is part of the C1 complex of the classical complement pathway. MASP-2 is a protease that is part of the alternative complement pathway. Once activated, MASP-2 cleaves complement factors C2 and C4. The cleavage of C2 by MASP-2 forms the C3 convertase of the lectin pathway. The cleavage of C4 by MASP-2 forms the C4b2a convertase of the lectin pathway. The classical complement pathway is activated by antigen-antibody complexes. The antibody in the complex binds to C1q in the C1 complex. The binding of the antigen-antibody complex to C1q activates the C1 complex. The activation of the C1 complex cleaves C4 and C2, forming the C3 convertase of the classical complement pathway. The alternative complement pathway is initiated by spontaneous activation of C3 convertase. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3 to amplify the alternative pathway.",
  "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common B cell malignancy in the Western hemisphere. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of small mature-appearing B cells in the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. The disease is generally an indolent course, but some patients may progress to a more aggressive form of the disease. The etiology of CLL is unknown, but genetic factors appear to play a role in the development of the disease. The immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) gene mutational status is the most important prognostic factor in CLL. Patients with mutated IgVH genes have a more favorable prognosis than patients with unmutated IgVH genes. The expression of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 7 0 (ZAP-7 0) is associated with unmutated IgVH genes and a poor prognosis. ZAP-7 0 is a tyrosine kinase that is expressed in T cells and in some B cells. ZAP-7 0 is involved in signal transduction downstream of the T cell receptor and the B cell receptor. The expression of ZAP-7 0 in B cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL by interfering with normal B cell receptor signaling.",
  "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells. The IL-2 receptor is composed of three chains, alpha, beta and gamma. The IL-2 receptor is expressed on activated T cells and some T regulatory cells. Binding of IL-2 to its receptor activates the JAK / STAT pathway. JAK kinases are activated by the IL-2 receptor and phosphorylate STAT transcription factors.

The PI3K / Akt pathway is also activated by the IL-2 receptor and contributes to T cell growth and survival.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid metabolite that regulates diverse cellular functions including cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. S1P is produced by the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase (SPHK). S1P is exported from cells and binds to five different G-protein coupled receptors (S1PR1-5). S1P has been implicated in a variety of disease processes including cancer, autoimmune disease, and heart disease. The S1PR1 receptor is involved in lymphocyte trafficking and lymphocyte homing to the spleen. The S1PR2 receptor is involved in the development of the heart and the regulation of vascular tone. The S1PR3 receptor is involved in platelet activation and inflammation. The S1PR4 receptor is involved in the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the inhibition of inflammatory cell migration. The S1PR5 receptor is involved in lymphocyte trafficking. The production of S1P is regulated by the enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase). N-SMase is activated by a variety of factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Fas, and reactive oxygen species. N-SMase activation results in the production of ceramide and the activation of sphingosine kinase. S1P is degraded by the S1P phosphatases (Sgpp1 and Sgpp2) and by the S1P lyase. The S1P phosphatases hydrolyze S1P to sphingosine and the inorganic phosphate. The S1P lyase cleaves S1P to phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal.",

These factors regulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration and angiogenesis. TGF-beta superfamily members signal through type II and type I serine / threonine kinase receptors. Type II receptors are constitutively associated with type I receptors and ligand binding to the type II receptor recruits type I receptors to form heterotetrameric complexes. Ligand binding to type II receptors results in the phosphorylation and activation of type I receptors by the type II receptor kinase. Activated type I receptors phosphorylate receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), including SMADs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8. Phosphorylated R-SMADs associate with the co-SMAD, SMAD4, and the heteromeric complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of target genes in association with other transcription factors and coactivators. Inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs) such as SMAD7 act as negative regulators of signaling by preventing phosphorylation and activation of R-SMADs. TGF-beta signaling is negatively regulated by several inhibitory factors, including SMAD7.",
  "The cell cycle is a tightly regulated series of events that leads to the duplication of cellular components and the division of cells. The G1 to S phase transition is a key regulatory checkpoint in the cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of kinases that control the cell cycle. The CDKs are activated by association with cyclins and inhibited by CDK inhibitors. The activity of CDKs is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and by association with CDK inhibitors. The E2F family of transcription factors regulates the expression of genes required for progression through the S phase and into the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The activity of E2F-1 is regulated by the cell cycle, by the tumor suppressor protein p53, and by the CDK inhibitors p16 and p19. The activity of p53 is regulated by p95, which binds to p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that is activated by DNA damage. The p53 tumor suppressor induces growth arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.",
  "Serine is a non-essential amino acid derived from glycine. It is a component of several amino acids including methionine, cysteine, threonine, and tryptophan.

  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR subtypes alpha, gamma and delta are involved in lipid homeostasis and glucose metabolism. PPAR-alpha is activated by fatty acids and their metabolites and plays a key role in lipid oxidation in liver and skeletal muscle. PPAR-gamma is activated by thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs and plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. PPAR-delta is involved in lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle. PPAR-gamma and PPAR-delta are also involved in the regulation of inflammation. The activation of PPAR-gamma by TZD drugs is responsible for the insulin-sensitizing effects of these drugs. The activation of PPAR-delta by fibrates is responsible for the lipid-lowering effects of these drugs.",
  "Endocytosis is the process by which extracellular material and plasma membrane constituents are delivered to the lysosome for degradation. It is a fundamental mechanism for nutrient uptake and for the regulation of plasma membrane composition and receptor-mediated signalling. Endocytosis is also involved in the uptake of pathogens and toxins from the extracellular environment. Endocytosis can be subdivided into two major pathways: clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) and clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). CDE is the best characterized pathway and is characterized by the formation of clathrin-coated pits, which pinch off from the plasma membrane to form clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). In contrast, the mechanisms of CIE are less well characterized. In addition to clathrin, CIE pathways include caveolae, GPI-anchored proteins, lipid rafts, and macropinocytosis.",
  "The immune system is made up of a variety of cells, each with its own set of proteins called markers. T cells are a type of white blood cell that help other cells in the immune system defend against infection. They are activated when they receive a signal from a cell called the antigen-presenting cell (APC), which takes up and presents antigen on its surface and then presents it to other cells in the immune system. The APC then expresses a protein called CD4 0 ligand, which binds to a protein called CD4 on the T cell surface. This interaction activates the T cell, allowing it to respond to the antigen. The T cell also expresses a protein called CD80, which binds to a protein called CD8l to help it stay in the resting state. When the T cell is activated, it also expresses a protein called Fas ligand, which binds to a protein called Fas on the surface of other cells. This interaction triggers the cell to die, causing the other cells in the immune system to die as well. This process of cell death is called apoptosis.",
  "The opioid receptors are members of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) gene family. The opioid receptors are activated by endogenous opioid peptides and are therapeutic targets for pain relief and treatment of addiction. The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is activated by the endogenous peptide dynorphin, and is involved in analgesia, while the mu opioid receptor (MOR) is activated by the endogenous peptide enkephalin and is involved in the euphoric effects of opiates. The delta opioid receptor (DOR) is activated by the endogenous peptide enkephalin, and is involved in analgesia and the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. The opioid receptors are coupled to G-proteins of the Gi / o family, and activation of the opioid receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase and the cAMP response element (CRE) -mediated gene transcription. Gi / o-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP formation leads to activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor CREB. The activation of CREB by the opioid receptors may be involved in the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids. The opioid receptors are also coupled to G-proteins of the Gq / 1 1 family, and activation of these G-proteins leads to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the serum response factor (SRF). The activation of SRF by the opioid receptors may be involved in the regulation of genes involved in neuronal development and differentiation.",
  "The forkhead family of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and metabolism. FKHR-L1 is a member of the forkhead family that is regulated by AKT. AKT phosphorylates FKHR-L1 at three conserved residues, resulting in cytoplasmic retention and inhibition of FKHR-L1 transcriptional activity. Growth factors activate AKT, which phosphorylates FKHR-L1, resulting in its inactivation and allowing for the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell survival.",
  "Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is characterized by a number of morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. The morphological changes are caused by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases that are activated by apoptotic stimuli. Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspase activation can be induced by two different pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the binding of death receptors on the cell surface, such as Fas, to their ligands. The binding of Fas ligand to Fas-receptor recruits the adapter protein FADD and the initiator caspase-8. The activated caspase-8 then activates caspase-3 and other caspases, leading to apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by cellular stress, such as DNA damage, and is mediated by mitochondria. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol triggers the formation of a caspase-activating complex called the apoptosome. The apoptosome activates caspase-9, which activates caspase-3. Caspase-3 cleaves cellular proteins, including the DNA repair enzyme PARP, that are important for maintaining cellular structure and function.",
  "The immune system is comprised of a variety of cells that communicate with one another through secreted cytokines and other signaling molecules. The immune system is constantly responding to the presence of foreign pathogens through the activation of innate immune cells and the subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines. The adaptive immune response is initiated by the recognition of foreign antigens by B cells and T cells, which proliferate and differentiate to produce antigen-specific effector cells. The activation of innate immune cells and the differentiation of antigen-specific effector cells are regulated by a variety of cytokines. Macrophages and other innate immune cells respond to a variety of stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, extracellular parasites, and fungi, and produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Macrophages also produce IL-18, a chemokine that recruits and activates NK cells and T cells. B cells and T cells respond to a variety of stimuli, including antigen, T cell costimulatory signals, and cytokines, to differentiate into antigen-specific effector cells. T helper cells differentiate into Th1 cells that produce the cytokines IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, or Th2 cells that produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10. Th1 cells are involved in cellular immunity and activate macrophages and other cells to fight intracellular pathogens, while Th2 cells are involved in humoral immunity and allergies. The differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells is regulated by the cytokines IL-12 and IL-4, respectively. IL-12 induces Th1 differentiation and the production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, while IL-4 induces Th2 differentiation and the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10. The differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells is also regulated by the cytokines IL-18 and IL-18 receptor. IL-18 induces Th1 differentiation and the production of IFN-gamma by activating the transcription factor STAT4. IL-18 also induces the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits Th1 differentiation and the production of IFN-gamma by Th1 cells. IL-18 receptor is expressed on Th1 cells and is required for IL-18 to induce Th1 differentiation and the production of IFN-gamma. IL-18 is produced by macrophages and other cells in response to LPS and other stimuli, and IL-18 receptor is expressed on Th1 cells. IL-18 receptor is also expressed on Th2 cells, but IL-18 does not induce Th2 differentiation. The differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells is also regulated by the cytokines IL-12p7 0 and IL-10. IL-12p7 0 induces Th1 differentiation and the production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, while IL-10 induces Th2 differentiation and the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10. The differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells is also regulated by the costimulatory molecules CD8 0 and CD8 6 on antigen-presenting cells that bind to the CD2 8 and CTLA-4 costimulatory receptors on T cells. The binding of CD8 0 and CD8 6 to CD2 8 and CTLA-4 induces the activation of T cells and the production of IL-2 and other cytokines. The differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells is also regulated by the transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3. T-bet induces Th1 differentiation and the production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, while GATA-3 induces Th2 differentiation and the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10.",
  "Cell migration is a fundamental process in development, wound healing, and metastasis of cancer cells. Cell migration is regulated by many factors, including growth factors, extracellular matrix, and cell-cell interactions. Cell migration is initiated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and is followed by the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, which are driven by actin polymerization. The formation of lamellipodia and filopodia is regulated by the small G protein Rac1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex, which nucleates actin polymerization. The formation of lamellipodia and filopodia is followed by the formation of focal adhesions, which are formed by the clustering of integrins and the recruitment of signaling molecules. The formation of focal adhesions is required for cell migration. Cell migration is also regulated by the small G protein RhoA, which induces the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) is a downstream target of RhoA and regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions through the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). Cell migration is also regulated by the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K is activated by growth factors and is required for cell migration. PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates Rac1 and Cdc4 2. PIP3 also activates the serine / threonine kinase Akt, which regulates cell migration through the phosphorylation of several targets.",
  "Angiotensinogen is the precursor of the vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II (AngII). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal cascade that regulates blood pressure and sodium balance. AngII is the effector peptide of the RAS. It is produced from angiotensinogen by the proteolytic action of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that cleaves off the C-terminal dipeptides from both angiotensin I and bradykinin. ACE is a key regulatory enzyme of the RAS. ACE is also known as dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-1 (DCP1). Bradykinin is a vasodilator peptide that is produced from its precursor kininogen by the action of kallikrein. Bradykinin is degraded by the enzyme ACE to produce the inactive metabolite angiotensin 1-8. ACE is also known as kininase II. The RAS is a key regulator of blood pressure and sodium balance. ACE inhibitors are a class of drugs used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thus blocking the action of angiotensin II at its receptor. ACE inhibitors are also used to treat heart failure and diabetic nephropathy. ACE inhibitors do not increase the levels of bradykinin, but increase the levels of the ACE substrate angiotensin 1-9. This peptide is an agonist of the bradykinin receptor. ACE inhibitors also increase the levels of the ACE substrate angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin 1-7 is a vasodilator peptide that acts through the G-protein coupled receptor MAS. The RAS also includes the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2). The RAS is a key regulator of cardiac growth and remodeling. ACE inhibitors block the action of angiotensin II at its receptor, blocking the growth of cardiac tissue. ACE inhibitors block the growth of cardiac tissue, preventing cardiac hypertrophy and dilation. ACE inhibitors block the growth of cardiac tissue, preventing cardiac hypertrophy and dilation. ACE inhibitors block the growth of cardiac tissue, preventing cardiac hypertrophy and dilation.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors that includes brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3). Neurotrophins are involved in the development and maintenance of the peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF is required for the survival and maintenance of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. NGF also plays a role in the development of sensory neurons and in the survival of developing motor neurons. NGF is also involved in learning and memory. NGF binds to TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, to initiate a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the ras-MAP kinase pathway and the ELK-1 transcription factor. NGF also binds to the p7 5 neurotrophin receptor, a member of the TNF receptor gene family. Binding of NGF to the p7 5 receptor can activate apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3. NGF also activates NF-kB through a pathway that does not involve the ras-MAP kinase pathway.",
  "Notch signaling is a conserved mechanism of cell-cell communication that is essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms. The Notch family of receptors and their ligands are both highly conserved throughout evolution. In addition to its role in development, Notch signaling is also involved in a number of pathological conditions, including cancer. Presenilin is the protease that cleaves the Notch receptor to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus and forms a transcriptional activation complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1, Su (H), Lag-1) and the coactivator Mastermind. CSL is a DNA-binding protein that represses transcription in the absence of NICD. In the absence of NICD, corepressors such as histone deacetylases and the histone methyltransferase MAML1 are associated with CSL. NICD displaces corepressors and recruits coactivators to convert CSL from a transcriptional repressor to an activator. Notch signaling regulates the expression of a number of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes.",
  "The intercalated disc (ID) is a specialized region of cardiac myocyte plasma membrane that provides a critical link between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cytoskeleton. The ID is a highly organized structure with distinct junctional complexes that transmit mechanical and electrical signals between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm. The ID is composed of two major junctional complexes: the desmosome, which provides strong intercellular adhesion, and the fascia adherens junction (FAJ), which provides a structural bridge between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. Desmosomes are composed of transmembrane proteins of the cadherin family (desmoglein and desmocollin) that interact with the cytoplasmic armadillo protein plakoglobin. Plakoglobin interacts with desmoplakin, which in turn binds to the intermediate filament protein desmin. The FAJ is composed of two major components: the fascia adherens junction (FAZ) and the gap junction (GJP). The FAZ is composed of the transmembrane proteins N-cadherin and beta-catenin, which interact with the cytoplasmic proteins alpha-catenin and plakoglobin. The GJP is composed of the integral membrane proteins connexin-4 3 (Cx4 3) and plakoglobin. The integrity of the ID is essential for normal cardiac function. Mutations in genes encoding proteins of the desmosome and the gap junction have been associated with inherited cardiac disorders including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and sudden cardiac death.",
  "Cell migration is a fundamental cellular function that is involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, inflammation, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. Cell migration is a complex process that requires the coordinated regulation of the cytoskeleton, membrane protrusion, adhesion, and membrane trafficking. Rho family GTPases are molecular switches that regulate many aspects of cell behavior, including cell migration. Rho regulates the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, which are involved in the formation of cell adhesions and cell motility. Rac and Cdc-4 2 regulate membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation, respectively, which are involved in cell migration. Rho also regulates membrane trafficking through the formation of membrane ruffles and vesicles. The regulation of membrane trafficking by Rho is mediated by the Rho effector protein kinase N (PKN). The regulation of membrane trafficking by Rho is also involved in the invasive migration of cancer cells.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGFR is activated by a variety of ligands including EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), amphiregulin (AREG), betacellulin (BTC), epiregulin (EREG), and epigen (EPGN). These ligands are synthesized as transmembrane precursors that are proteolytically cleaved to release soluble growth factors. The soluble ligands bind to the extracellular domain of the EGFR and induce receptor dimerization and activation. The intracellular domain of the EGFR contains a tyrosine kinase domain that is activated by ligand-induced dimerization. Receptor activation leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain that serve as docking sites for signaling molecules. The adaptor protein Shc binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the EGFR and couples to the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAPK pathway. The Grb2-Sos complex is recruited to the receptor via binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the EGFR and couples to the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAPK pathway. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) are also recruited to the activated EGFR and contribute to the activation of the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAPK pathway. Growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) is an adaptor protein that couples to the EGFR and couples to the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAPK pathway. Grb2 also couples to the adaptor protein Gab1 and couples to the Ras / Map kinase pathway as well as the PI3K pathway. The adaptor protein Shc couples to the EGFR and couples to the Grb2-Sos complex. Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) is a docking protein that couples to the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAPK pathway as well as the PI3K pathway. Gab1 also couples to the Crk-associated substrate (CAS) / Crk pathway. The Crk adaptor protein couples to the Crk / DOCK1 8 0 pathway.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically programmed cell death that is characterized by a series of morphological changes including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated by cleavage or other mechanisms. Caspases are grouped into initiator and executioner caspases. Caspases-2, -8, -9, and -1 0 are initiator caspases that activate the downstream executioner caspases-3, -6, and -7. The caspase cascade is initiated by the activation of initiator caspases, which in turn activate the downstream executioner caspases. Caspases are activated by two main pathways, the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the binding of death receptors of the TNF receptor gene family to their ligands. Caspases-8 and -1 0 are activated by the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which is formed on the cell surface by the ligation of the receptor and its adaptor protein FADD. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by various apoptotic stimuli, such as DNA damage, ER stress, and hypoxia. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol is a key event in the intrinsic pathway. Cytochrome c activates Apaf-1, which in turn activates caspase-9. Caspases-3, -6, and -7 are the main executioner caspases. Granzyme-B is a protease released from cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells to induce apoptosis in virus-infected or transformed cells. Granzyme-B activates caspases directly and also activates the caspase-independent pathway.",
  "The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily is the largest gene family in the human genome. GPCRs respond to a wide variety of stimuli, including light, odorants, neurotransmitters, lipids, and peptides, and are the target of many drugs. The GPCRs are coupled to intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins, which are composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The alpha subunits of G proteins are classified into four families (Gs, Gi, Gq / 1 1, and G1 2 / 1 3), and each family is coupled to a different set of effectors. The Gs family is coupled to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and an increase in cAMP levels, the Gi family is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and the Gq / 1 1 family is coupled to the activation of phospholipase C and the release of intracellular calcium. The G1 2 / 1 3 family is coupled to the activation of Rho and the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (betaARK1) and the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are two important regulators of GPCR signaling. The betaARK1 phosphorylates agonist-occupied GPCRs and targets them for desensitization and internalization. The RGS proteins are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the alpha subunits of G proteins and act as negative regulators of GPCR signaling. The Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP pathway is involved in learning and memory, and is also involved in heart failure and asthma. The Gi-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP pathway is involved in heart rate control and is also involved in heart failure and asthma.

The G1 2 / 1 3-Rho pathway is involved in cell proliferation and is also involved in heart failure and asthma.",
  "The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is activated by the chemokine ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1). SDF-1 is expressed in the bone marrow and recruits leukocytes to the bone marrow during immune responses. The CXCR4 receptor is also expressed on the surface of lymphocytes and is involved in lymphocyte homing to the bone marrow. Binding of SDF-1 to CXCR4 activates a G-protein coupled signaling pathway that includes activation of phospholipase C, release of intracellular calcium, activation of protein kinase C, and activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The MAP kinase pathway includes activation of the small G-protein Rac, which activates the MAP kinase kinase kinase MEKK1, which activates the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf, and ultimately activates MAP kinase ERK1 and ERK2. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway by SDF-1 through CXCR4 is distinct from the pathway activated by the growth factor receptor CXCR4 that includes PI3 kinase and Akt. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway by SDF-1 through CXCR4 may play a role in lymphocyte homing to the bone marrow.",
  "The regulation of the cell cycle is a complex process that involves the coordinated activation of a variety of proteins. The cell cycle is regulated by the interaction of cyclins with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The activity of CDKs is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and by the presence of CDK inhibitors. The activity of cyclins is also regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The transition from G1 to S phase is regulated by the interaction of cyclin D with CDK4 or CDK6 and the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). The transition from G1 to S phase is also regulated by the interaction of cyclin E with CDK2 and the phosphorylation of the Rb and the protein encoded by the p61c- gene. The transition from G2 to M phase is regulated by the interaction of cyclin A with CDK2. The progression through the cell cycle is also regulated by the interaction of checkpoint control proteins with cyclins and CDKs. The checkpoint control proteins include the protein kinases ATM and ATR, which are activated by DNA damage and phosphorylate the checkpoint proteins chk1 and chk2. These proteins then phosphorylate cdc2 5, a phosphatase that activates cdc2 (CDK1), and phosphorylate the CDK inhibitors, p27 and p19, that inhibit the activity of cdc2. The checkpoint control proteins also regulate the interaction of cyclins with CDKs. The interaction of cyclin A with CDK2 is inhibited by the checkpoint control protein p21. The interaction of cyclin B with CDK1 is inhibited by the checkpoint control protein p19.",
  "Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically regulated mechanism of cell death that is essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, growth factor withdrawal, radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and viral infection. The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a key role in regulating apoptosis. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal, cytotoxic drugs, and radiation. Bcl-2 functions by interacting with other Bcl-2 family members to regulate the release of mitochondrial factors that induce apoptosis. Bcl-2 interacts with Bax, another Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bax interact to form a heterodimer that inhibits apoptosis. Other Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, promote cell survival, interacting with Bax to inhibit apoptosis. Bax promotes apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, which activates caspases and other apoptotic factors. Bad is another Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to release cytochrome c. Bid is a Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis by interacting with Bax. Bad is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) in response to growth factor signaling, which inhibits its interaction with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to promote cell survival. Bcl-xL is a Bcl-2 family member that promotes cell survival by interacting with Bax to inhibit apoptosis. Bad is also a Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-xL to inhibit apoptosis. Bax is a Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis. Interaction of Bax with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL inhibits their anti-apoptotic activity. Other Bcl-2 family members, such as Bak and Bik, do not interact with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to promote apoptosis. Bad and Bax are also regulated by phosphorylation. Other factors involved in regulating apoptosis include the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) that inhibit caspase activation, and the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) that inhibits caspase activation by caspase-activated DNase (CAD). IAP proteins interact with caspases to inhibit their activity. ICAD is cleaved by caspase-3 to release CAD, which induces apoptosis.",

  "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone secreted by the atrial cardiocytes in response to atrial stretch. ANP is a 2 8-amino acid peptide with a ring structure formed by the oxidation of a cysteine residue and a C-terminal amino acid. ANP is a potent natriuretic and diuretic agent. The biological effects of ANP are mediated by binding to its receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A). The binding of ANP to NPR-A activates the receptor-coupled guanylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cGMP levels. The cGMP then activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-regulated PDE3, and cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase, leading to the inhibition of Na + / Ca + exchanger and the activation of the Na + / K + ATPase. The inhibition of the Na + / Ca + exchanger and the activation of the Na + / K + ATPase by ANP reduce intracellular Na + and Ca + + levels, leading to water and salt excretion. The activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by ANP also leads to the phosphorylation of phospholamban, which relieves its inhibition on the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca + -ATPase, increasing the reuptake of Ca + + into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and leading to increased relaxation of cardiac myocytes. The activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by ANP also leads to the phosphorylation of the heat shock protein 2 7, which may contribute to the anti-hypertrophic action of ANP. The anti-hypertrophic action of ANP may also be mediated by the inhibition of the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathway. The activation of NF-kB by hypertrophic stimuli such as angiotensin II leads to the induction of hypertrophic genes. ANP inhibits the activation of NF-kB by blocking the degradation of I-kB, the inhibitor of NF-kB.",
  "The Rho family of small GTPases (Rho, Rac and Cdc-4 2) are molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. The cycling between the GDP- and GTP-bound states is regulated by three classes of proteins: Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) and Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors (GDIs). GEFs promote the exchange of GDP for GTP, GAPs stimulate the intrinsic GTP-ase activity of GTPases, and GDIs inhibit the release of GTPases from the membrane and keep them in the inactive state in the cytosol. The Rho GTPases regulate a variety of cellular functions including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility, gene expression, cell cycle progression and membrane trafficking. The best characterized downstream effectors of Rho are the ROCK kinases (ROCK I and II), which are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility. ROCK kinases also phosphorylate LIM kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin, an actin-binding protein that stimulates actin depolymerization. ROCK also phosphorylates and inhibits myosin phosphatase, increasing actin-myosin interactions and stimulating contraction. ROCK is involved in the regulation of neurite retraction and neuronal cell migration. Other Rho effectors include the PKN kinase, which phosphorylates and activates the ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) family of proteins, which link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.

  "The regulation of skeletal muscle growth and development is a complex process involving the coordinated expression of multiple genes. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plays a key role in skeletal muscle growth and development. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen for many cell types, including skeletal muscle cells. IGF-1 stimulates muscle cell proliferation and differentiation. IGF-1 exerts its effects through the IGF-1 receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family. The IGF-1 receptor is expressed in skeletal muscle and its expression increases during muscle development. The IGF-1 receptor activates several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. The activation of these pathways leads to the expression of immediate early genes, such as c-fos and Egr-1, and late response genes, such as myogenin and myosin light chain. The coordinated expression of these genes leads to the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells.",
  "Heart development is a complex process that requires the integration of multiple signaling pathways. The Wnt pathway is one of several signaling pathways that are involved in cardiogenesis. Wnt signaling is involved in the formation of the first heart field, which gives rise to the left and right ventricles and parts of the atria. Wnt signaling is also involved in the second heart field, which gives rise to the outflow tract and parts of the atria. Wnt signaling is also involved in the development of the cardiac conduction system. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of secreted factors also plays a role in cardiogenesis. Members of this family include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), activins and inhibins. TGF-beta family members signal through serine-threonine kinase receptors and SMAD family members. TGF-beta family members are involved in the formation of the cardiac cushions, septation of the heart, and the development of the cardiac valves.",
  "Tight junctions (TJs) are cell-cell contacts that restrict the movement of solutes and lipids between the apical and basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells. They are formed by the association of transmembrane proteins, occludin, claudins and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), with cytoplasmic proteins. The cytoplasmic proteins include the MAGuK protein ZO-1, which interacts with occludin, ZO-2, ZO-3, and the myosin-binding protein cingulin. ZO-1 also binds to the actin cytoskeleton through its association with ZO-2 and actin. The PAR complex, consisting of PAR-3, PAR-6 and aPKC, is localized at the apical region of epithelial cells and is involved in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. The PAR complex is also involved in the organization of tight junctions. The PAR complex is localized at the apical region of epithelial cells and is involved in the organization of tight junctions.",
  "The growth and development of hematopoietic cells is regulated by a variety of cytokines. The actions of these cytokines are mediated through specific cell surface receptors. The binding of cytokines to their receptors results in the activation of a variety of signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT, MAPK, and PI3 kinase pathways. The net effect of these pathways is to regulate cellular survival, proliferation, and differentiation.",
  "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells are a major component of the immune system and play a key role in the defense against viral infection and tumor cells. CTLs and NK cells are activated by the interaction of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with specific antigens on the surface of tumor cells or virus-infected cells. Activated CTLs and NK cells induce apoptosis in target cells through two major pathways, the perforin / granzyme pathway and the Fas / Fas ligand (FasL) pathway. Perforin is released by CTLs and NK cells and forms pores in the membrane of target cells, allowing the entry of granzyme proteases into the cytosol of the target cell. Granzyme A and granzyme B are the most abundant granzyme proteases in CTLs and NK cells and are the major proteases that induce apoptosis in target cells. Once in the cytosol, granzyme B activates caspase-3, -7 and-6, which are key proteases in apoptosis. Perforin also induces apoptosis in target cells through a caspase-independent pathway. The interaction of Fas on the surface of target cells with Fas ligand on the surface of CTLs induces apoptosis in target cells. The interaction of perforin and granzyme with the target cell membrane and the interaction of Fas with its ligand induce the release of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c and AIF into the cytosol. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form an apoptosome that activates caspase-3, -7 and-6. AIF induces apoptosis independently of caspase activation.",
  "The transcription factor NFAT is a key regulator of cytokine expression in T cells. In resting T cells, NFAT is sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with the proteins 14-3-3 and 19kDa-AKAP. T cell activation leads to the activation of phospholipase C, the production of IP3 and release of calcium from intracellular stores. The increase in intracellular calcium activates calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NFAT binds to the IL-2 promoter and other NFAT-dependent promoters and activates transcription. The activity of NFAT is regulated by phosphorylation. The kinases GSK-3 and cdk9 phosphorylate NFAT and cause it to be retained in the cytoplasm. Dephosphorylation by calcineurin causes NFAT to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The activity of NFAT is also regulated by binding of 14-3-3 and 19kDa-AKAP. 14-3-3 binds to NFAT when it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and prevents it from translocating to the nucleus. 19kDa-AKAP binds to NFAT and anchors it in the cytoplasm. Binding of cAMP to PKA causes the regulatory subunit of PKA to dissociate from the catalytic subunits, allowing them to phosphorylate NFAT and cause it to be retained in the cytoplasm. The activity of NFAT is also regulated by the kinase PKC. PKC activates calcineurin, causing NFAT to be dephosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus. The kinase PKA can also inhibit NFAT by phosphorylating it and causing it to be retained in the cytoplasm.",
  "Cyclin B is a regulatory subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1. It is required for the transition from the G2 to the M phase of the cell cycle. The activity of cyclin B / CDK1 is regulated by the phosphorylation of CDK1 and the phosphorylation of the cyclin B. The phosphorylation of CDK1 is regulated by the balance of the activities of the kinases and phosphatases. The phosphatase PP2A dephosphorylates CDK1 and inactivates CDK1. The phosphatase CDC2 5 activates CDK1 by dephosphorylating CDK1 and activating cyclin B / CDK1. The activity of CDC2 5 is regulated by the phosphorylation of CDC2 5 by the kinase p38 and the phosphatase PP2A. The kinase p38 activates CDC2 5 and inactivates PP2A. The phosphatase PP2A dephosphorylates CDC2 5 and inactivates CDK1. The activity of PP2A is regulated by the phosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit by PKC and the dephosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit by the p21 kinase. The kinase p38 is activated by the EGF receptor and PKC and inhibited by the kinase p21.",
  "The interferon gamma receptor is a heterodimer of two subunits, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. The ligand for the receptor is interferon gamma, a cytokine secreted by activated T cells that is involved in the immune response. Interferon gamma binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor and signals through the JAK / STAT pathway to activate transcription of interferon-stimulated genes. The receptor is also involved in other cellular processes such as cell adhesion and apoptosis. The receptor is found on the surface of cells of the immune system, including macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells. The receptor is also found on some epithelial cells. The IFNGR1 subunit is a 70000Dalton protein that is associated with the IFNGR2 subunit in the plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic domain of IFNGR1 is involved in signaling and contains several tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by JAK kinases in response to ligand binding. The JAK kinases phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors that move into the nucleus and activate transcription of interferon-stimulated genes. The IFNGR2 subunit is a transmembrane protein that is associated with JAK2 in the plasma membrane. The activation of JAK kinases by the receptor is believed to be mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of IFNGR2. The role of the receptor in other cellular processes is not yet clear.",
  "Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease resulting from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The autoimmune destruction of beta-cells leads to a deficiency in insulin secretion and the clinical symptoms of diabetes. The disease is caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include viral infections, dietary factors, and chemicals. The genetic factors include mutations in immune regulatory genes such as the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) gene and the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2 2 (PTPN2 2) gene. The CTLA-4 gene is involved in the regulation of T cell activation and tolerance. The PTPN2 2 gene is involved in the regulation of T cell activation and the control of T cell receptor signaling. The mutations in these genes may lead to an imbalance in the immune system and an increased susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes. The genetic factors also include the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC genes. The MHC is the most polymorphic region of the genome and is responsible for presenting foreign antigens to T cells. Non-MHC genes include those involved in insulin production (insulin gene), beta-cell function (PDX1), and immune regulation (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 2 (PTPN2 2), and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type 6 (PTPRD)). Environmental factors may trigger the autoimmune process in genetically predisposed individuals by altering the immune system, leading to the production of autoantibodies and T cells that are reactive to beta-cell antigens. The autoantibodies are used as markers to identify individuals at risk for developing T1DM. T cells that are specific for beta-cell antigens are found in the peripheral blood of individuals at risk for T1DM. The beta-cell-specific autoantibodies are produced by autoreactive B cells. The presence of these autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells in the blood of individuals at risk for T1DM indicates that the autoimmune process leading to T1DM begins before the onset of clinical diabetes. The autoimmune response is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and islet antigen-2 (IA-2).

  "The Rab GTPases are a family of small GTPases that regulate intracellular membrane traffic and are involved in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, cell cycle control, differentiation, and malignant transformation. The human Rab family consists of more than 6 0 members and is classified into five subfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity: Y111110 (Rab1A), Y11120 (Rab1B), Y11130 (Rab11cl8), Y11140 (Rab27A), and Y11150 (Rab11c29). The Rab11c29 subfamily consists of three closely related proteins, Rab1c29, Rab11c4p, and Rab11c1p. Rab11c29 is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in the regulation of ER to Golgi traffic. Rab11c4p is expressed in secretory cells and is involved in the regulation of exocytotic transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Rab11c1p is expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Each Rab protein is localized to a specific membrane compartment and is associated with a specific set of proteins that regulate its activity and membrane association. Guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rabs by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rabs by stimulating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. The activity of Rabs is also regulated by GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) that bind to the inactive GDP-bound form of Rabs and prevent membrane association. The localization and activity of Rabs are also regulated by post-translational modifications such as prenylation and phosphorylation. The post-translational modifications of Rabs are catalyzed by a set of specific enzymes, RabGGTase, Rab1p11and Rab1p22. The prenylation of Rabs by RabGGTase is catalyzed by Rab1p12 and is essential for the membrane association and biological activity of Rabs. The activity of Rab1p112 is regulated by the Rab1p22 GAP. The phosphorylation of Rab1p11 and Rab1p19 by casein kinase II (CK II) inhibits the membrane association and biological activity of Rab1p11 and Rab1p19.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily contains several members that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and activation of the immune system. One of these receptors, TNFR1, is activated by both the cytotoxic TNF and the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha binds to two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which are differentially expressed on different cell types. TNF-alpha is a key mediator of inflammation and is involved in autoimmune disorders and septic shock. TNF-alpha binds to both TNFR1 and TNFR2 and activates two different signaling pathways. In the cytotoxic pathway, TNF-alpha binding to TNFR1 induces apoptosis in some cell types. In the survival pathway, TNF-alpha binding to TNFR1 activates the transcription factor NF-kB, which leads to the expression of genes involved in inflammation and the immune response. The cytotoxic and survival pathways of TNF-alpha signaling are differentially regulated by the TRAF proteins, which are recruited to the receptor complex by the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. TRAF2 is involved in the activation of NF-kB and the activation of apoptosis by TNF-alpha. TRAF1 is involved in the activation of NF-kB but not apoptosis by TNF-alpha. TRADD is involved in both pathways. The activation of NF-kB by TNF-alpha is mediated by the kinase NIK and the kinase map kinase 8. The TRAF proteins interact with NIK and map kinase 8 to activate NF-kB.",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells that contain more than 40 hydrolases that degrade a variety of macromolecules in the endolysosome. Lysosomal hydrolases are transported to the lysosome by mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). The binding of MPRs to mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues in the mannose-6-phosphate-containing proteins (M6PRs) is followed by their transport to the late endosome (LE). In the LE, the proteins are packaged into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) by the action of the vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) and the endosomal-associated membrane protein (EAP) complex. In addition to MPRs, other pathways for lysosomal enzymes include clathrin-dependent endocytosis, mannose-6-phosphate-independent endocytosis, and phagocytosis. The intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) are then released from the LE by the action of the vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) and the EAP complex. The soluble contents of the lysosome are acidified by the action of the vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase). Acidification of the lysosome is essential for the activation of lysosomal hydrolases and the subsequent digestion of macromolecules.",
  "The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that provides protection against invading pathogens and is essential for the maintenance of homeostasis. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and provides early protection through the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection. The adaptive immune system is a second line of defense that is activated hours to days after the innate immune system has been activated and provides long-term protection through the generation of antigen-specific immune cells. The innate immune system is composed of cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) that do not require antigen-specific activation and that respond rapidly to invading pathogens through the recognition of conserved molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors, and the pentraxin family of proteins. PAMPs are recognized by PRRs and activate signaling pathways that induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The adaptive immune system is composed of T cells and B cells and is required for the generation of antigen-specific immune cells and the generation of immunological memory. T cells are further classified into Th1 and Th2 cells based on their cytokine expression profiles. Th1 cells produce proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) and are important for intracellular infections, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and are important for extracellular infections and allergic responses.",
  "The peptide hormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that is also mitogenic and may play a role in cell growth and differentiation. ET-1 is produced by endothelial cells and is secreted into the circulation. ET-1 is also produced by a variety of other tissues, including the heart, kidney, and lung. ET-1 is a member of a gene family that also includes ET-2 and ET-3. The three peptides are derived from a common precursor by the action of two distinct proteases. ET-1 is the most potent vasoconstrictor yet identified, causing a rapid and sustained increase in blood pressure when infused into humans. ET-1 acts on its receptors on the smooth muscle cell surface to increase intracellular calcium and other signaling pathways. ET-1 also has mitogenic activity and may play a role in cell growth and differentiation. ET-1 is a substrate for the metalloprotease EC3, also known as endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE). ECE cleaves big ET-1 to ET-1, which is the biologically active form. ET-1 is a substrate for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the enzyme that produces angiotensin II from angiotensin I. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor that may also play a role in cell growth and differentiation. ET-1 may also play a role in cardiac hypertrophy and renal disease.

  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the key regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. It is released into the portal circulation in a pulsatile fashion and acts on the pituitary to stimulate the release of LH and FSH. The frequency of GnRH pulses varies throughout the mammalian reproductive cycle and is a major factor in the control of the differential synthesis and release of the two gonadotropins. The frequency of GnRH secretion is thought to be regulated by the negative feedback of the sex steroids on the hypothalamus and pituitary. At the level of the hypothalamus, this is mediated by the release of the peptide transmitters, kisspeptin and tuberoinfundibular dopamine. At the level of the pituitary, the frequency of GnRH stimulation is determined by the amount of GnRH released per pulse and the responsiveness of the gonadotrope to GnRH. The sensitivity of the gonadotrope to GnRH is modulated by the expression of the GnRH receptor and the activation of the protein kinase A and calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase pathways. The expression of the GnRH receptor is regulated by the action of the transcription factors EGR1, EGR-2 and PITX2. The expression of the genes for the alpha and LHbeta subunits of LH and FSH is also regulated by the transcription factors PITX1 and PITX3.",
  "The Nrf2 / ARE pathway is a key cellular defense mechanism that regulates the expression of a battery of genes encoding phase II detoxification and antioxidant enzymes. Nrf2, a member of the Cap'n'collar (CNC) family of bZIP transcription factors, is a key regulator of this pathway. Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) found in the regulatory regions of these genes. Nrf2 is normally localized in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through association with the actin-bound cytoplasmic repressor protein, Keap1. Induction of phase II genes by Nrf2 activators such as tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) requires Nrf2 nuclear translocation and DNA binding. Nrf2 activators such as tBHQ induce the phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of Nrf2 on serine 4 0 by ERK. The phosphorylation of Nrf2 on serine 4 0 by ERK promotes the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 and the subsequent Nrf2 nuclear translocation. The dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 is essential for Nrf2 activation. The dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 is facilitated by the disruption of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex by the cysteine reactive small molecule inducers such as sulforaphane. The dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 is also facilitated by the disruption of the Nrf2-actin and Keap1-actin complexes. The disruption of the Nrf2-actin complex is facilitated by the phosphorylation of Nrf2 by ERK1 / 2. The dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 and the disruption of the Nrf2-actin complex are essential steps for Nrf2 activation. The induction of phase II genes by Nrf2 activators is essential for protection against oxidative stress and carcinogens. The constitutive activation of Nrf2 in many cancer cells may contribute to the drug resistance of cancer cells.",
  "The olfactory system is a complex sensory system that detects and discriminates between a large variety of odorants. The olfactory epithelium is a pseudostratified neuroepithelium lining the nasal cavity. Each cell in the epithelium is unique in its morphology and function. The sensory neurons are the most numerous cell type in the epithelium and are located in a layer of cells called the basal cell layer. The dendrites of these neurons are exposed to the environment and are the site of odorant detection. The cell bodies of the neurons are located in the middle of the epithelium and extend their axons into the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The axons of the sensory neurons synapse with second order neurons in the olfactory bulb to form the first synapse in the olfactory pathway. The second order neurons are projection neurons that send their axons to higher brain centers. The olfactory receptor genes are expressed in a combinatorial fashion in a monogenic or low-complexity manner. Each neuron expresses only one of the approximately 1, 0 0 0 different odorant receptors. The combinatorial expression of these receptors allows the recognition of a large variety of odorants. The expression of the receptor genes is regulated by a complex array of transcriptional control elements. The olfactory receptor genes are located in a large gene family. Each family contains a large number of genes that are similar in sequence but distinct in their expression patterns. The olfactory receptor genes are organized into a cluster on the chromosome. The olfactory receptor genes are separated by large regions of DNA that are not expressed in the olfactory receptor neurons. The transcriptional control elements that regulate the expression of the olfactory receptor genes are located in the large intergenic regions. The transcriptional control elements that regulate the expression of the olfactory receptor genes are located in the olfactory receptor gene promoters and in the intergenic regions. The olfactory receptor gene promoters contain the basal transcriptional machinery and transcription factors that regulate the expression of other genes. The olfactory receptor intergenic regions contain multiple transcriptional control elements that regulate the expression of the olfactory receptor genes. The olfactory receptor gene transcriptional control elements are regulated by a complex interplay of positive and negative regulatory factors.",
  "The heat shock protein 40 (HSP40), also known as heat shock protein 9 0 (HSP9 0), is a molecular chaperone that assists in the folding of other proteins and regulates the activity of other proteins. The activity of HSP9 0 is regulated by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The binding of ATP to HSP9 0 is regulated by co-chaperones such as cdc3 7 and p140. The p140 protein is a co-chaperone that binds to HSP9 0 and regulates its activity. The p140 protein is also a component of the IKK complex that regulates the activity of the transcription factor NF-kB. The IKK complex includes the IKKa kinase, the IKKb kinase and a third protein, NEMO. The IKKa and IKKb kinases phosphorylate the NF-kB inhibitor, IkB, causing IkB to be ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteosome. The NF-kB transcription factor then enters the nucleus and activates genes that regulate apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and inflammation. The activity of the IKK complex is regulated by phosphorylation of the IKKa and IKKb kinases. The activity of the IKK complex is also regulated by the binding of the p140 co-chaperone to HSP9 0. The p140 protein is an ATPase that binds to the N-terminal domain of HSP9 0. The activity of the p140 protein is regulated by the binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain of p140. The binding of ATP to p140 causes a conformational change in p140 that allows it to bind to the IKK complex and activate the IKK complex. The binding of the p140 protein to the IKK complex is regulated by the binding of the cdc3 7 co-chaperone to HSP9 0. The cdc3 7 protein binds to the C-terminal domain of HSP9 0 and the binding of cdc3 7 to HSP9 0 is regulated by the binding of the p140 protein to the N-terminal domain of HSP9 0. The activity of the IKK complex is also regulated by the binding of the IKKa kinase to the N-terminal domain of IKKa. The binding of the IKKa kinase to the N-terminal domain of IKKa causes the phosphorylation of the activation loop of IKKa and activation of the kinase. The activity of the IKKa kinase is also regulated by the binding of the IKKb kinase to the N-terminal domain of IKKa. The binding of the IKKb kinase to the N-terminal domain of IKKa causes the phosphorylation of the activation loop of IKKa and inactivation of the IKKa kinase. The regulation of the IKK complex by the binding of the p140 protein to the N-terminal domain of IKKa and the binding of the IKKa kinase to the N-terminal domain of IKKa are similar to the regulation of the src kinase by the src kinase. The regulation of the src kinase by the src kinase also involves the binding of the src kinase to the N-terminal domain of the src kinase and the binding of the cdc3 7 co-chaperone to the C-terminal domain of the src kinase. The binding of the cdc3 7 co-chaperone to the C-terminal domain of the src kinase is regulated by the binding of the p140 protein to the N-terminal domain of the src kinase.",
  "Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin. The biological effects of PDGF are mediated by two structurally similar receptor tyrosine kinases, the alpha and beta forms, encoded by distinct genes. Binding of PDGF to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase in the cytoplasmic domain. The activated receptor tyrosine kinase stimulates a complex signaling network that leads to cellular proliferation and migration. The major signaling pathways activated by the PDGF receptor are the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway. The Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway is activated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the subsequent association of Grb2-Sos-1 with the receptor. The PI3 kinase pathway is activated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and the subsequent association of PI3 kinase with Gab1. The net effect of these signaling pathways is to stimulate the expression of immediate early genes such as fos and jun. These genes in turn activate a number of genes involved in cellular proliferation and migration.",
  "The formation of focal adhesions is a key component of cell migration. Focal adhesions are large macromolecular complexes that form at the ends of actin stress fibers and contain many structural and signaling proteins. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix interactions and are essential for the formation of focal adhesions. Integrins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein talin and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Talin binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin and also binds to the cytoskeletal protein vinculin. Talin binding to integrins activates the integrin signaling pathway and also provides a link to the actin cytoskeleton. FAK is also a component of focal adhesions and is activated by integrin signaling. FAK interacts with src and other signaling molecules in the focal adhesion complex. The activation of src by FAK may provide a pathway for the phosphorylation of other focal adhesion components. Rho family GTPases are also involved in the regulation of focal adhesions. Rac and Cdc-4 2 activate the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, while Rho inhibits these processes. The regulation of Rho family GTPases by integrins and other signaling pathways may provide a mechanism for the coordinated regulation of cell migration and other processes by the extracellular matrix.",
  "Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in men in the United States. Approximately 7 0% of bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), which arise from the transitional epithelium. The etiology of bladder cancer is complex and involves multiple factors. The formation of bladder cancer is a multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The most common genetic alterations in bladder cancer are in the tumor suppressor genes p53 and RB, and the oncogene RAS. Alterations in the p53 and RB genes lead to uncontrolled proliferation and loss of cell-cycle control. RAS mutations are associated with the induction of proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. The identification of these molecular alterations may provide novel targets for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic markers, and for the development of more effective therapies.",
  "Phagocytosis is the process by which cells engulf and ingest large particles such as bacteria and large particles of IgG-coated material. The binding of IgG-coated particles to Fc gamma receptors on the surface of macrophages activates a signaling pathway that leads to the formation of actin-rich structures called phagosomes. Phagosomes mature through a series of steps that are coordinated by actin. Nascent phagosomes move centripetally towards the cell center, where they acquire early endosomal markers. As phagosomes mature, actin is depolymerized and the vesicles are fused with late endosomal and lysosomal membranes. Phagocytosis is essential for the effective removal of infectious agents and apoptotic cells. Defects in this process can lead to autoimmune disorders and chronic inflammation.",
  "The mucosal immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is composed of two major compartments, the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and the immune effector cells in the mucosa. MALT is organized into distinct anatomical compartments, organized lymphoid tissue and GALT. GALT consists of organized lymphoid tissue, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and other lymphoid tissues. The effector cells in the mucosa include macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes. Macrophages and neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. Macrophages phagocytose bacteria and present bacterial antigens to T cells in the context of MHC-II molecules. Macrophages and neutrophils produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12. Macrophages and neutrophils also induce mucosal tissue damage through the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Macrophages and neutrophils also induce mucosal tissue damage through the production of TNF-alpha and other inflammatory cytokines. Macrophages and neutrophils also induce mucosal tissue damage through the production of proteases. T cells are the effector cells of the mucosal immune system. T cells are classified into two types, Th1 and Th2 cells, based on their cytokine expression patterns. Th1 cells produce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and are involved in cellular immunity. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 and are involved in humoral immunity. Macrophages and neutrophils are the effector cells of cellular immunity. Macrophages and neutrophils produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Macrophages and neutrophils also induce mucosal tissue damage through the production of TNF-alpha and other inflammatory cytokines. Macrophages and neutrophils also induce mucosal tissue damage through the production of TNF-alpha and other inflammatory cytokines.",
  "The binding of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) to its receptor (CSF-1R) activates multiple signaling pathways that regulate proliferation and differentiation of cells of the monocyte / macrophage lineage. The CSF-1R is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and is activated by its ligand, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Binding of CSF-1 to the extracellular domain of the CSF-1R induces receptor dimerization and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain. The CSF-1R activates multiple signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway. The activation of these pathways leads to proliferation and differentiation of cells of the monocyte / macrophage lineage.",
  "The MET receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF). HGF is a potent mitogen for hepatocytes and has morphogenic activity in epithelial cells. The MET receptor is a heterodimer with a beta-chain that contains the tyrosine kinase domain and an alpha-chain that contains a four-domain structure including a Sema domain. The MET receptor is activated by HGF binding to the Sema domain. The beta-chain tyrosine kinase phosphorylates several cellular proteins including the adaptor protein GRB2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Gab1. The adaptor proteins GRB2 and Shc bind to MET and activate the Ras / Map kinase pathway. The Ras / Map kinase pathway leads to activation of ELK1 and the p21-activated kinase (PAK) pathway leads to activation of Jun and ATF2. The Ras / Map kinase pathway also leads to activation of the p38 Map kinase pathway. The p38 pathway leads to activation of ets-2 and induction of genes such as cyclin D1. The combination of activation of the Ras / Map kinase and p38 Map kinase pathways leads to cell proliferation and cell motility.",
  "The coagulation cascade is a series of enzymatic reactions that lead to the formation of a clot at the site of vascular injury. The first step in this cascade is the activation of prothrombin by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin activates factors V and VIII, which together form factor Xa. Activated factor Xa cleaves prothrombin to thrombin, which activates factors V and VIII, and also cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin. The clot is stabilized by the binding of fibrin monomers to each other and to the platelets in the clot. The activation of prothrombin by thrombin is the point at which the coagulation cascade is initiated. The prothrombin activation complex (PTC) is a macromolecular complex that activates prothrombin. The components of the PTC are Factors V, VIII, prothrombin, and thrombin. The formation of the PTC is regulated by two inhibitors, antithrombin III and protein C. Antithrombin III is a glycoprotein that inhibits the activity of thrombin by forming a 1: 1 complex with it. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen that is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Activated protein C inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, which are cofactors for the prothrombinase complex. The inhibition of thrombin formation by antithrombin III and protein C is an important regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive blood clotting.",
  "The Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of four cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) that associate with the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors. Cytokines that activate the JAK / STAT pathway include IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-1 2, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, leptin, growth hormone, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and IL-1RA. The JAKs are activated by cytokine binding and phosphorylate the receptor on tyrosine. The phosphorylated receptor serves as a docking site for the STAT proteins, which are latent transcription factors that are activated by phosphorylation. The STATs are then able to dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription. The JAKs are also involved in other signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathway. The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are induced by cytokines and act as negative regulators of cytokine signaling.",
  "The Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in development and is also involved in the development of cancer. Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that bind to Frizzled receptors and low-density lipoprotein-related protein co-receptors. In the absence of Wnt signaling, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3beta and is targeted for degradation by the proteasome. Wnt binding to Frizzled leads to inhibition of GSK-3beta, resulting in accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm. Beta-catenin then enters the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF / LEF transcription factors to activate transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Wnt signaling can also lead to beta-catenin-dependent activation of the transcription factor p30-catenin, which interacts with the APC tumor suppressor protein to regulate cell proliferation. Mutations in beta-catenin, APC, and other members of the Wnt signaling pathway have been implicated in cancer.",
  "Axons are long, thin, cylindrical projections that are guided by a variety of guidance cues in their environment. Axons are guided by attractive and repulsive guidance cues. The attractive guidance cues include netrins, ephrins, and slits. The repulsive guidance cues include ephrins, netrins, and semaphorins. These guidance cues are expressed on the surface of both the target tissue and the growing axons. They interact with their receptors on the growth cone to determine the direction of growth cone extension.",
  "TNF is a cytokine that induces both inflammation and apoptosis. The TNF receptor family includes four members, TNFR1 (also called p55 or CDw 5 5), TNFR2 (also called p7 5 or CDw 2 9), Fas (CD95), and TRAIL-R1 (CD03 0) and -R2 (CD02 9). These receptors are all type I integral membrane proteins with a C-terminal cytoplasmic region called the death domain (DD). The DD is an approximately 8 0 amino acid motif that is found in many proteins involved in apoptosis and inflammation. The DD is also found in some of the proteins that interact with the TNF receptor family to transduce signals. The first protein with a DD in the TNF receptor family was TNFR1. The DD is essential for signaling by TNFR1. The DD of TNFR1 interacts with the DD of TNF receptor associated protein (TRADD). TRADD also interacts with the DD of FAS and the adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated via death domain). FADD in turn interacts with and activates caspase-8. Activation of caspase-8 leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-3, a protease that cleaves many cellular proteins and induces apoptosis. The DD of TNFR1 also interacts with the DD containing protein RIP (receptor interacting protein). RIP is involved in TNF induced activation of NF-kB and JNK kinases. The DD of TNFR1 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor 2). TRAF2 is involved in TNF induced activation of NF-kB and JNK kinases.",
  "Cutaneous pigmentation plays a critical role in camouflage, mimicry, social communication, and protection against harmful solar radiation. Melanogenesis is a complex process involving multiple cellular and molecular steps. The key regulatory step in the biosynthesis of melanin is the formation of melanin from its precursor, L-dopa. Melanogenesis is regulated by a variety of agents, including hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and UV light. The first two steps in the biosynthetic pathway are catalyzed by tyrosinase (monophenol monooxygenase) and dopachrome tautomerase. The resulting melanin is formed either by oxidation-coupled reduction of dopaquinone or by polymerization of dopaquinone. Melanin is classified as either phaeomelanin or eumelanin based on its color. Eumelanin is brown, black, or yellow, and is deposited in hair, skin, and eyes. Melanin synthesis is also regulated by various factors, including cAMP, alpha-MSH, and agouti signaling protein. Melanin synthesis is also regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS inhibit tyrosinase activity and melanogenic proteins. Melanin synthesis is also regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Melanin synthesis is also regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Melanin synthesis is also regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Melanin synthesis is inhibited by ROS generated by UV light.",
  "Glycolysis is a central pathway of glucose metabolism that produces pyruvate, a precursor of many important metabolites, including glucose, amino acids, and lipids. In this pathway, glucose is converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and subsequently to fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP). Then, GAP is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by two steps. One is catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and the other is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK). PEP is converted to pyruvate by the action of enolase. Pyruvate is converted to either acetyl-CoA or a combination of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolite in the pathway of fatty acid synthesis. In addition to these enzymes, there are a number of enzymes involved in the metabolism of other sugars, such as tagatose-6-phosphate (T6P), ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P), xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P), and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). These sugars are converted to the corresponding monosaccharides by the action of specific enzymes.",
  "The heart is a highly coordinated organ system that pumps blood throughout the body. The heart is composed of three major cell types: cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells. The contractile force of the heart is generated by the coordinated contraction of individual cardiomyocytes, which are electrically coupled by gap junctions. The heart is a highly adaptable organ system that responds to a variety of stresses by undergoing changes in size, shape, and function. Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response to increased hemodynamic load that is initially a compensatory response, but can progress to heart failure if prolonged. Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cardiomyocyte size, which is initially mediated by an increase in protein synthesis. The increase in protein synthesis is accompanied by an increase in the expression of fetal cardiac genes, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The increase in protein synthesis is mediated by the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway. In addition to the increase in protein synthesis, the breakdown of proteins also plays an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The increase in protein breakdown is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",
  "The Krebs cycle is a central metabolic pathway that produces NADH and FADH2 to drive oxidative phosphorylation. It also produces key metabolites such as acetyl-CoA, which is used to acetylate proteins to regulate gene expression. The Krebs cycle is a multi-step pathway consisting of eight major reactions and two minor reactions. The eight major reactions occur in the mitochondrial matrix and are catalyzed by enzymes found in the mitochondrial matrix. The two minor reactions occur in the bacterial cytosol and the intermembrane space of mitochondria. The Krebs cycle begins with the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to form citrate. Citrate is then converted to isocitrate by the enzyme aconitase. Isomer 1 of isocitrate is converted to 2-oxoglutarate by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. 2-oxoglutarate is then converted to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Succinyl-CoA is converted to fumarate by the enzyme fumarate hydratase. Fumarate is then converted to malate by the enzyme malate dehydrogenase. Malate is transported out of the mitochondria and is converted to pyruvate by the enzyme malic enzyme. Pyruvate is transported out of the mitochondria and is converted to acetyl-CoA by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. The acetyl-CoA is then converted to citrate by the enzyme citrate synthase. The cycle is completed with the oxidative decarboxylation of citrate to form carbon dioxide and the reduction of the six-carbon compound of succinate to the four-carbon compound of malate. The Krebs cycle is also involved in fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis. The oxidation of fatty acids produces acetyl-CoA, which is converted to citrate by the enzyme citrate synthase. Citrate is then converted to 2-oxoglutarate by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. 2-oxoglutarate is converted to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Succinyl-CoA is converted to fumarate by the enzyme fumarate hydratase. Fumarate is converted to malate by the enzyme malate dehydrogenase. Malate is transported out of the mitochondria and is converted to pyruvate by the enzyme malic enzyme. The pyruvate is transported back into the mitochondria and is converted to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The acetyl-CoA is then oxidized by the Krebs cycle to produce NADH and FADH2.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Disruption of this pathway has been implicated in the development of cancer. The type II TGF-beta receptor (TGFBR2) is a tumor suppressor gene. Mutation of TGFBR2 has been found in a variety of human cancers, including colon, gastric, and breast. In addition, TGFBR2 mutations have been found in HNPCC patients. The TGFBR2 gene is located on 3p2 2. 1, a region that shows frequent loss of heterozygosity in many types of cancer. The TGFBR2 protein is a serine / threonine kinase that transduces TGF-beta signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus. In the absence of ligand, TGFBR2 homodimerizes and phosphorylates TGFBR1. Activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then complex with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription. The PTEN gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in a variety of cancers. PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K / AKT pathway, which is involved in cell survival and proliferation. PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3, the product of PI3K, and thus inhibits the activation of AKT. The SMAD proteins are transcription factors that regulate the expression of a variety of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a multi-subunit complex that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for the recognition of foreign antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the surface of other cells. The TCR is composed of a heterodimer of TCRalpha and TCRbeta associated with CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta2 dimers. The CD3 complex is non-covalently associated with the TCRzeta chain. The TCR-CD3 complex is responsible for transducing the antigen recognition signal into the T cell. The CD3 complex is also involved in the regulation of T cell activation. The activation of T cells requires two signals. The first signal is provided by the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) binding to antigen bound to MHC. This signal is called the \"signal 1\". The second signal is provided by the interaction of the T cell receptor with costimulatory molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. This interaction is called the \"signal 2\". The CD24 coreceptor is involved in the second signal. The CD24 coreceptor is a type I transmembrane protein that is expressed on the surface of T cells only during the early stages of T cell activation. CD24 binds to the CD3epsilon chain of the TCR-CD3 complex. The interaction of CD24 with the TCR-CD3 complex prevents the T cell from becoming anergic. Anergic T cells are non-responsive to subsequent antigen stimulation and do not proliferate or secrete cytokines. The interaction of CD24 with the TCR-CD3 complex also down-regulates T cell activation. The interaction of CD24 with the TCR-CD3 complex also prevents the T cell from becoming cytolytic. The interaction of CD24 with the TCR-CD3 complex also prevents the T cell from becoming anergic. The interaction of CD24 with the TCR-CD3 complex also prevents the T cell from becoming cytolytic.

CXCR4 is expressed on a variety of cell types including lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, and neurons. The ligand for CXCR4 is CXCL1 2, also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Binding of CXCL1 2 to CXCR4 activates a variety of signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) pathway, and the p38 kinase pathway. Activation of these signaling pathways leads to changes in cellular migration, proliferation, and gene expression.",
  "Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Although most ECs are sporadic, a small fraction (5-1 0%) are associated with an inherited predisposition syndrome. ECs are classified into two major histologic types: type I, which is associated with a good prognosis, and type II, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Type I endometrioid ECs are frequently associated with mutations in the PTEN, K-RAS, and beta-catenin genes, whereas type II non-endometrioid ECs are associated with mutations in the p53, k-RAS, and Her2 / neu genes. Mutations in PTEN are the earliest genetic alterations in endometrial carcinogenesis. PTEN inactivation leads to activation of the AKT pathway, which stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. K-RAS activation leads to the constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, which stimulates cell proliferation. Beta-catenin activation causes the activation of the Wnt pathway, which stimulates cell proliferation and also contributes to the invasive phenotype. Amplification of the HER2 / neu gene and overexpression of the protein are associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that regulates growth and metabolism. The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is a member of the cytokine receptor family and is coupled to the Jak / Stat signaling pathway. In addition to activating the Jak / Stat pathway, GH also activates the Ras / Map kinase pathway. The Map kinase pathway is activated by the interaction of GH with its receptor, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, the recruitment of Grb-2 and Sos-1, and the activation of Ras. Ras activates the Map kinases Erk1 and Erk2, which phosphorylate and activate a number of transcription factors including ELK-1, which leads to activation of genes involved in proliferation. The PI3 kinase pathway is also activated by GH and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. The role of AKT in the transcriptional activation by GH is not yet clear, but may be related to the inhibition of apoptosis by AKT. The activation of PI3 kinase by GH also leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of FKHRL1, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. Phosphorylated and inactivated FKHRL1 is localized in the cytoplasm, where it is unable to activate transcription. When dephosphorylated, FKHRL1 is transported into the nucleus, where it activates transcription of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle progression. The phosphorylation of FKHRL1 by AKT may also contribute to the anti-apoptotic activity of AKT.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Binding of EGF or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF\u03b1) to the extracellular domain of the EGFR induces receptor dimerization and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase.

The homophilic interaction of PECAM-1 is important for the formation of cell-cell adhesions. The PECAM-1 extracellular domain also interacts with integrins to regulate cell-matrix adhesions. The interaction of PECAM-1 with integrins and the cytoskeleton may also be involved in the regulation of cell-cell adhesions.",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine that regulates red blood cell production. Epo is produced in the kidney in response to hypoxia and stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. Epo binds to its receptor on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and stimulates their proliferation and differentiation into red blood cells. Epo also stimulates the survival of erythroid progenitor cells. Epo is produced in very low levels in the liver under normoxic conditions and is induced by hypoxia in the kidney and other tissues. Epo production in the liver is induced by hypoxia through the transcription factor HIF-1. HIF-1 is a transcription factor that is induced by hypoxia and stimulates the expression of genes involved in oxygen delivery and cell survival. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta. HIF-1beta is a subunit in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) family of transcription factors. HIF-1alpha is induced by hypoxia and is the oxygen regulated subunit of HIF-1. ARNT is a constitutive transcription factor that forms a heterodimer with HIF-1beta and is not regulated by oxygen tension. HIF-1alpha is degraded in the proteosome in normoxic cells through the action of a VHL-dependent ubiquitin ligase. In hypoxic cells, the VHL ubiquitin ligase is inhibited and HIF-1alpha is stabilized. HIF-1 activates the transcription of genes involved in red blood cell production, including the gene for Epo. HIF-1 also activates the transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism, cell survival, and cell proliferation. HIF-1 also activates the transcription of genes encoding many other proteins that are not directly involved in red blood cell production, including genes involved in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. The activation of red blood cell production by HIF-1 is opposed by the transcription factor NFkB. NF-kB is a transcription factor that is activated by a variety of stimuli, including hypoxia. NF-kB opposes the induction of red blood cell production by HIF-1 and inhibits red blood cell production in response to hypoxia. NF-kB opposes the induction of red blood cell production by Epo by inhibiting the transcription of the Epo gene. NF-kB opposes the induction of red blood cell production by Epo by inhibiting the transcription of the Epo receptor gene.",
  "Fc epsilon RI is a high affinity receptor for the Fc portion of IgE. It is expressed on mast cells and basophils and is the receptor for the anaphylactic reaction. Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI induces degranulation and the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators. The degranulation releases preformed inflammatory mediators such as histamine and serotonin. The newly synthesized mediators include leukotrienes and prostaglandins. The activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-AT leads to the production of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-4.",
  "The Krebs cycle is a central metabolic pathway that produces NADH and FADH2 to drive oxidative phosphorylation. The cycle begins with acetyl-CoA, the activated form of acetate, which is converted to citrate by citrate synthase. The citrate is then split down the pathway to produce four molecules of NADH and two molecules of FADH2. The oxidation of NADH and FADH2 provides the energy for the process. The first reaction of the cycle is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase, which decarboxylates isocitrate to yield alpha-ketoglutarate and CO2. The next four reactions are catalyzed by the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which decarboxylates alpha-ketoglutarate to yield succinyl-CoA. Succinyl-CoA is then a precursor for the biosynthesis of many important metabolites, including amino acids, heme, and pyrimidine nucleotides. The fifth reaction of the cycle is catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, which condenses succinyl-CoA with ADP to yield succinate and CoA. The sixth reaction of the cycle is catalyzed by fumarase, which catalyzes the conversion of fumarate to malate. The cycle continues with the oxidation of these two molecules of malate to yield oxaloacetate and pyruvate. Oxaloacetate is converted to aspartate by aspartate aminotransferase. The oxidation of pyruvate yields two molecules of NADH and two molecules of FADH2. The NADH and FADH2 are oxidized by the electron transport chain to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to yield ATP. The electron transport chain consists of four protein complexes, each of which transfers a single electron from NADH or FADH2 to a final electron acceptor. The oxidation of NADH and FADH2 releases energy in the form of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The proton gradient is used by ATP synthase to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi.",
  "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which results from the reciprocal translocation t (9; 2 2) (q3 4; q1 1). The product of the BCR-ABL fusion gene is a deregulated tyrosine kinase that is responsible for the pathogenesis of CML. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) has revolutionized the treatment of CML. Imatinib is highly effective in patients with chronic-phase CML, but is less effective in patients with accelerated or blast phase disease. Resistance to imatinib can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain, amplification of the BCR-ABL gene, or overexpression of drug efflux pumps. blast phase CML is a rapidly progressive disease, with a short median survival of 6 months. The development of second-generation TKIs, such as nilotinib and dasatinib, has provided additional treatment options for patients with imatinib-resistant CML.",
  "The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections. WAS patients also have a variety of neurological defects. The gene defective in WAS encodes a protein called WASP, which is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization. WASP interacts with a variety of proteins, including Arp2 / 3, a complex that nucleates actin polymerization. The interaction of WASP with Arp2 / 3 is inhibited by the binding of WASP interacting protein (WIP) to WASP. The binding of GTP-bound Rac to the WASP-interacting protein (WIP) -WASP complex relieves WASP inhibition and activates WASP to stimulate actin polymerization. The binding of Cdc4 2 to WASP also activates actin polymerization, but does not relieve WASP inhibition of Arp2 / 3. The interaction of WASP with the Abl tyrosine kinase is also involved in the regulation of actin polymerization.",
  "The protein translocation apparatus of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is a macromolecular complex that recognizes, transports, and disposes of proteins that are to be secreted, membrane inserted, or degraded. The protein translocation apparatus consists of three distinct protein complexes: the signal recognition particle (SRP), the Sec6 1 protein-conducting channel, and the docking or docking complex. In the targeting of proteins to the ER membrane, the ribosome is first bound by the signal recognition particle (SRP). The ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex is then targeted to the docking complex, consisting of the membrane protein Sec6 1 and the docking / SRP receptor. The ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex is then transferred to the membrane-bound Sec6 1 complex, in which the polypeptide chain is inserted into the membrane in a cotranslational manner.",
  "The proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades proteins in a highly selective manner. Proteins to be degraded are first tagged with multiple ubiquitin molecules by a three-step process involving a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). Proteins tagged with ubiquitin are recognized by the proteasome, an ATP-dependent protease complex, and are degraded by the proteasome into small peptides. The proteasome is a large protein complex with multiple subunits. The proteasome is a barrel-shaped complex consisting of four rings stacked together to form a 26SA proteasome. The two outer rings are each composed of 7SA proteins, PA70 or PA35. The two inner rings are each composed of 6SA proteins, PA28 or PA29. The PA28 and PA29 proteins are regulatory proteins that bind to the 20S proteasome to form the 26S proteasome. The PA70 and PA35 proteins are PA28 and PA30 proteins that are involved in PA7 0 / PA35 recognition of ubiquitinated proteins, deubiquitination, and 20S proteasome activation. The PA28 and PA30 proteins are encoded by separate genes and are present in different forms of the 26S proteasome. The PA28 proteins are PA28alpha and PA28beta. The PA28alpha protein is encoded by the PSMC2 gene. The PA28beta protein is encoded by the PSMC3 gene. The PA28beta protein is encoded by the PSMC3. gene. The PA201 protein is also a regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome. The PA201 protein is encoded by the PSMD1. gene. The PA201 protein is a proteasome activator that stimulates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The PA27 protein is a proteasome inhibitor that blocks the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The PSMD2. gene encodes the PA27 protein.",
  "The WEE1 kinase phosphorylates and thereby inactivates the CDK1 / cyclin B complex, preventing the cell from entering mitosis. The kinase activity of WEE1 is inhibited by phosphorylation of a single site, tyrosine 1 5, by the kinases Abelson tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) and the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90 RSK). The p90 RSK kinase is activated by the MAP kinase pathway, which is activated by growth factor receptors and the small G-protein Ras. The WEE1 kinase is also inhibited by the p21 protein (p21 Cip1), which is induced by the tumor suppressor p53. The WEE1 kinase is a component of a feedback loop that prevents the cell from entering mitosis when DNA is damaged. The WEE1 kinase is degraded when the cell enters mitosis, releasing the CDK1 / cyclin B complex to promote mitosis.",

  "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which results from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The fusion gene BCR-ABL encodes a protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that deregulates a number of signaling pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The discovery of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has revolutionized the treatment of CML. Imatinib mesylate has been shown to induce hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML. However, some patients develop resistance to imatinib mesylate, and some patients in chronic phase develop a more aggressive phase, termed accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP). The mechanisms of resistance to imatinib mesylate are complex and include the development of mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL. The development of new drugs that inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity and are effective against imatinib-resistant CML cells is an important goal.",
  "The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is structurally similar to the insulin receptor. IGF-1R is expressed in many different tissues and is involved in the regulation of growth, differentiation and transformation. IGF-1R is activated by its ligands, IGF-1 and IGF-2, and is involved in transformation and anti-apoptosis. The IGF-1R signaling pathway is similar to that of the insulin receptor, with the exception of the adaptor proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are involved in the activation of the PI3 kinase pathway by the insulin receptor, but not the IGF-1R. The IGF-1R activates the ras / MAP kinase pathway through Shc and Grb-2, but does not activate PI3 kinase.",
  "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a key cytokine in the development of Th1 cells and Th1-mediated immune responses. The IL-12 receptor is a heterodimer of IL-12 receptor beta 1 (IL-12Rbeta1) and IL-12 receptor beta 2 (IL-12Rbeta2). The IL-12Rbeta1 is responsible for the signal transduction, while the IL-12Rbeta2 is responsible for the high affinity binding of IL-12. The IL-12Rbeta1 is also the ligand binding subunit of the IL-118 receptor. The IL-12Rbeta2 is also a component of the IL-4 receptor. The IL-12Rbeta2 is expressed on Th1 cells and is not expressed on Th2 cells. The IL-12Rbeta2 is also expressed on a small population of natural killer cells and activated macrophages.

  "Eosinophils are leukocytes that are derived from the bone marrow and are found in the blood, tissues, and the placenta. Eosinophils are important in host defense against parasitic infections, but they can also cause tissue damage in response to certain allergens. Eosinophils are activated by a variety of cytokines, including IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF. IL-5 is a key cytokine in eosinophil differentiation, activation, and survival. IL-5 is produced by a variety of cells, including activated T cells and mast cells. IL-5 binds to a receptor on the eosinophil surface that is composed of two chains, IL-5Ralpha and the betac chain. The IL-5Ralpha chain is also part of the receptor for IL-3 and GM-CSF. The betac chain is a component of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12, and IL-15. The IL-5Ralpha chain is required for IL-5 signaling, but it is not required for signaling by IL-3 or GM-CSF. The IL-5Ralpha chain is also called the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor. IL-5 signaling is important in eosinophil differentiation and activation, and blocking IL-5 signaling may be useful in the treatment of allergic diseases.",
  "Melanoma is a cancer of pigment producing melanocytes that have been de-differentiated. The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in the last 3 0 years. The etiology of melanoma is complex and includes both environmental and genetic factors. The role of the environment is well established with intermittent sun exposure being a major risk factor. The identification of genes that are mutated in melanoma has provided important insights into the molecular basis of melanoma. The CDKN2A gene encodes two proteins, p16INK4A and p21CIP, that play a key role in cell cycle regulation. Mutations in this gene are found in approximately 2 0% of melanoma cases. The CDK4 gene encodes a protein that binds to the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and regulates the G1 to S phase transition. Activating mutations in the NRAS gene are found in approximately 1 5% of melanoma cases. The BRAF gene encodes a protein kinase that transduces growth signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Mutations in this gene are found in approximately 5 0% of melanoma cases. The PTEN gene encodes a phosphatase that regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis. Mutations in this gene are found in 5-1 0% of melanoma cases. The MC1R gene encodes a receptor for the hormone alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH).

  "The NFAT family of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of a number of genes involved in the immune response, cardiac hypertrophy, and other cellular processes. In resting cells, NFAT is phosphorylated and sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to 1 4-3-3. Activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin leads to dephosphorylation of NFAT, its translocation to the nucleus, and activation of NFAT-dependent transcription. The activity of NFAT is regulated by a variety of kinases and phosphatases, including PKA, PKC, and calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT to activate its transcriptional activity, while phosphorylation by kinases such as PKA and PKC inhibits NFAT activity. The regulation of NFAT by kinases and phosphatases is complex, involving multiple phosphorylation sites and multiple kinases and phosphatases. The activity of NFAT is also regulated by other transcription factors and signaling pathways.",
  "Cell migration is essential for a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, and immune responses. Cells migrate in response to extracellular signals, such as growth factors, that activate cell surface receptors. Cell migration requires the formation of new cell-substratum adhesions at the leading edge and the disassembly of adhesions at the cell rear. The formation of new adhesions at the leading edge is mediated by the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc4 2, while the disassembly of adhesions at the cell rear is mediated by Rho. Rac and Cdc4 2 activate the p2 1-activated kinase (PAK), which phosphorylates and activates the kinase LIM-kinase. LIM-kinase phosphorylates cofilin, a regulator of actin filament dynamics, and stimulates its actin-depolymerizing activity. Phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM-kinase blocks cofilin activity, increasing actin filament stability and inhibiting cell migration. Rac also activates the WAVE complex, which stimulates actin polymerization through the Arp2 / 3 complex. Rac and Cdc4 2 also activate the kinase PAK1, which phosphorylates and activates the protein kinase Mek1. Mek1 phosphorylates and activates p38 Map kinase, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor p38. The activation of p38 Map kinase by Rac and Cdc4 2 also contributes to cell migration through an unknown mechanism.",
  "The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway plays a critical role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis in adults. The pathway is activated by three secreted HH ligands (SHH, IHH, and DHH) that bind to the Patched (Ptc) receptor. This binding relieves Patched-mediated inhibition of the 7TM protein Smoothened (Smo). Smo activation leads to the inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase activity of the beta-TRCP complex, which normally targets the transcription factors Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 for proteolytic degradation in the proteasome. The resulting accumulation of these transcription factors in the nucleus leads to the activation of target genes, including ptc-1 and cyclin-D2.",
  "Homologous recombination (HR) is a mechanism for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). HR is initiated by the generation of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region, which is then coated with the ssDNA binding protein RPA. The ssDNA-RPA complex is then converted to a 3 \u2019 -ssDNA by the action of the recombinase, RAD5 1. The strand exchange activity of RAD5 1 is stimulated by several HR mediators, including BRCA2, which displaces RPA from ssDNA and loads RAD5 1 onto ssDNA. Once loaded, RAD5 1 forms a right-handed helical filament on ssDNA, which is the active form for homology search and strand exchange. The nucleoprotein filament is stabilized by BRCA2 and several accessory factors, including the tumor suppressor protein BLM, to allow HR to proceed. Once strand exchange has been completed, the RAD5 1 filament is deactivated by the anti-recombinase, Srs2. Once deactivated, RAD5 1 can be removed from the DNA by the ATP-dependent translocase activity of BLM or the structure-specific endonuclease activity of MUS81-EME1. Once repaired, HR can be completed by synthesis-dependent strand-annealing (SDSA) or by double Holliday junction (dHJ) resolution. In SDSA, the newly synthesized DNA is dis-pasted to the broken molecule, and the remaining joint molecule is resolved by a helicase or a structure-specific endonuclease. In dHJ, the two Holliday junctions are then resolved by structure-specific endonucleases.",
  "The c-kit receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated by its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). SCF / c-kit signaling is involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, gametogenesis, and melanogenesis.

  "The role of cilia and flagella in the movement of cells and microorganisms is well established. Cilia are also involved in the sensation of light and in the regulation of the flow of liquids in the kidney. The cilium is a microtubule-based structure that extends from the surface of cells. The dynein motor complex is responsible for moving cilia and other intracellular structures along microtubules. The dynein complex is made up of several different proteins, including dynein heavy chains, intermediate chains, light intermediate chains and light chains. The dynein heavy chain is encoded by DNA116 and is responsible for the ATPase activity of the dynein complex. The dynein intermediate chain is encoded by DNA114 and is involved in the binding of cargo to the dynein motor complex. The dynein light chain is encoded by DNA113 and is involved in the regulation of the activity of the dynein motor complex. The nexin-dynein-1complex is involved in the regulation of the activity of the dynein motor complex. The ARL1 3B gene encodes a small GTPase that is associated with the cilia and flagella. Mutations in this gene lead to the Joubert syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterised by a specific brain malformation and renal dysfunction. The ARL1 3B protein is localised to the primary cilia and is involved in the regulation of the activity of the dynein motor complex. The ARL1 3B protein is also involved in the regulation of the sonic hedgehog signalling pathway.",
  "The BCAR1 gene was identified as a gene that is differentially expressed in breast cancer cells selected for metastatic spread. The BCAR1 protein is a scaffold protein that coordinates the action of several signaling pathways. One of the pathways regulated by BCAR1 is the MAP kinase pathway. The BCAR1 protein binds to the p21-activated kinase (PAK) and the downstream MAP kinase kinases, MKK4 and MKK7. The BCAR1 protein also binds to the adaptor protein CRK and the tyrosine kinase c-src. The BCAR1 protein also binds to the focal adhesion protein paxillin. The interaction of BCAR1 with paxillin may localize the protein to focal adhesions and coordinate the action of the BCAR1 protein in response to integrin signaling. The BCAR1 protein also binds to the focal adhesion protein Cas. The interaction of the BCAR1 protein with the focal adhesion proteins may coordinate the action of the BCAR1 protein in response to integrin signaling. The interaction of the BCAR1 protein with the p21-activated kinase may also regulate the activity of the BCAR1 protein. The interaction of the BCAR1 protein with the focal adhesion proteins may also regulate the action of the BCAR1 protein in response to integrin signaling.",
  "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder that progresses from a chronic phase (CP) to an accelerated phase (AP) and finally to blast phase (BP). The hallmark of CML is the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9q3 4 and 22q21. The translocation creates a BCR-ABL fusion gene, which encodes a constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The BCR-ABL fusion protein has a profound effect on multiple cellular signaling pathways, leading to the uncontrolled proliferation and reduced apoptosis of CML cells. The development of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly STI5 7 1), a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has dramatically changed the treatment of CML. Imatinib mesylate has also been approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to harmful stimuli, such as infection, injury, or degeneration. The inflammatory response is mediated by a variety of cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, and is characterized by the infiltration of leukocytes into tissues. The infiltration of leukocytes is induced by the production of chemokines and cytokines by various types of cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and their subsequent interaction with leukocytes. Chemokines are small chemoattractant cytokines that are classified into four groups on the basis of their cysteine residues: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C. The C chemokines are mainly involved in the attraction of leukocytes, and the other chemokines are involved in the recruitment of other cell types. Macrophages and fibroblasts are the major source of chemokines, and they are activated by various inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, and TNF. The interaction of chemokines with their receptors on leukocytes plays a crucial role in the recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites.",
  "Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a multi-functional protein that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). PS1 is a component of the gamma-secretase complex that cleaves APP to generate the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) that accumulates in the brains of patients with AD. PS1 is also involved in the Notch signaling pathway, in which it functions as a gamma-secretase component. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in cell fate determination during development, and is also involved in the maintenance of stem cells in adult tissues. The role of PS1 in the Notch signaling pathway may be involved in the development of cancer. The role of PS1 in the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which may also be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The role of PS1 in the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP may also be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and neuronal differentiation.",
  "The complement system is a key component of the innate immune system that provides a rapid response to infection. The complement system is activated by three different pathways, the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All three pathways converge in the formation of a C3 convertase that cleaves the complement protein C3 into C3a and C3b. The C3 convertase is a central component of the complement cascade and is the point of convergence for all three complement activation pathways. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by the C1 complex. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of microbial carbohydrates by the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway. The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous activation of C3 convertase. The cleavage of C3 by the C3 convertase leads to the formation of the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC causes lysis of cells that are unprotected by complement regulatory proteins. The anaphylatoxin C3a and the MAC cause inflammation and cell lysis, respectively. The formation of the MAC causes the swelling and lysis of cells that are unprotected by complement regulatory proteins. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins plays a key role in development and tissue homeostasis. Wnt signaling is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and is often misregulated in cancer. Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled (Fz) receptors and activate two different signaling pathways, one involving beta-catenin and the other involving the small G-protein, Rac. In the beta-catenin pathway, binding of Wnt to Frizzled leads to inhibition of the APC / axin / GSK-3 beta complex, resulting in stabilization of beta-catenin. In the absence of Wnt signaling, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3 beta and is targeted for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Stabilized beta-catenin can then move into the nucleus and associate with the TCF / LEF family of transcription factors to activate transcription of Wnt responsive genes. In the Rac pathway, Wnt signaling leads to activation of the small G-protein Rac, which activates the JNK kinase cascade. JNK activation leads to phosphorylation of DSH, which then activates MEKK1, which in turn activates JNK. The transcriptional coactivator p300 is also involved in Rac signaling, and phosphorylation of p300 by JNK leads to its dissociation from p300 and activation of TCF-mediated transcription.",
  "Trefoil factors are a family of small peptides with a common four amino acid sequence (SWEETPV) that are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract in a highly tissue-specific manner. They are secreted into the intestinal lumen where they are thought to act as hormones, promoting mucosal restitution and wound repair. Trefoil factors are also expressed in a number of tumours where they may play a role in tumour development and metastasis. Trefoil factor expression is regulated by a number of factors including growth factors, cytokines and extracellular matrix components. The trefoil factor genes are regulated by a number of different transcription factors including AP-1, SP-1, HNF-3, HNF-1 and NF-IL6. Trefoil factor expression is also regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms.",
  "Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is critical for tissue homeostasis and the removal of damaged or abnormal cells. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in the execution phase of apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases are classified into two groups: the initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -1 0) that respond to apoptotic stimuli and the effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) that amplify the caspase cascade. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by the binding of ligands to cell surface receptors, such as Fas, and leads to the direct activation of caspase-8. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, and ER stress, and results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which activates caspase-3. Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Bid is a substrate of caspase-8 and is cleaved to produce tBid, which translocates to mitochondria to induce the release of cytochrome c. The translocation of AIF from mitochondria to the nucleus also induces nuclear condensation and fragmentation. The inhibition of apoptosis by Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is associated with their ability to prevent the release of cytochrome c and AIF.",
  "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a major protein degradation system in eukaryotic cells. Proteins are targeted for degradation by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a 7 6 amino acid protein, to a lysine residue. Proteins that are marked for degradation by the ubiquitin pathway are recognized by a large multi-subunit complex, the proteasome, and are degraded in an ATP-dependent manner. The proteasome is a barrel-shaped protease with two stacked rings each containing 6subunits. The two outer rings are identical and each contains 13subunits. The two inner rings are identical and each contains 14subunits. The two stacked rings form a channel through which proteins must pass to be degraded. The entry of proteins into the proteasome is regulated by a set of proteasome activators. The three proteasome activators that have been identified in mammalian cells are PA2 8alpha, PA2 8beta and PA200. PA2 8alpha and PA2 8beta are homologous activators that form heptamers that activate the proteasome to degrade peptides but do not degrade proteins. PA200 is a large activator that is not homologous to PA2 8 but forms a ring that binds to the proteasome and activates the proteasome to degrade proteins. Proteins that are marked for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are marked by ubiquitin. The addition of ubiquitin to the protein is a signal that targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Proteins that are not marked by ubiquitin are not degraded by the proteasome. The addition of ubiquitin to the protein is a three step process. The first step is the activation of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) by ATP. The second step is the transfer of ubiquitin to the protein to be tagged by the E1. The third step is the transfer of ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-activating enzyme to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). The E2 enzyme then interacts with the proteasome activator PA200 to open the channel in the proteasome to allow proteins to be degraded.",
  "Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone that regulates calcium metabolism and bone density. Vitamin D3 binds to its receptor in the cell nucleus and regulates the transcription of many genes. The vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate transcription. The vitamin D3-VDR-RXR complex binds to vitamin D3 response elements (VDREs) in the promoter regions of target genes and recruits coactivators such as SRC-1 and p160 to remodel chromatin and facilitate transcription. In the absence of ligand, VDR is bound by corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT. The binding of ligand causes a conformational change in VDR, which alters the interaction between VDR and coactivators and corepressors. The binding of coactivators such as SRC-1 and p160 causes histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling, while the binding of corepressors such as NcoR and SMRT causes histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation. The vitamin D3-VDR-RXR complex also interacts with components of the basal transcriptional machinery, such as CBP / p300 and TBP, to regulate transcription.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor gene family. It forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific DNA sequences (peroxisome proliferator response elements, PPREs) in the promoter region of target genes. PPARgamma plays a key role in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. PPARgamma is activated by fatty acids and their metabolites, such as 1 5deoxy-delta1 2, 1 4prostaglandin J2 (1 5PGJ2). PPARgamma induces adipocyte differentiation by inducing the expression of genes involved in lipid storage, including the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and the glycerol-3P-acyltransferase (GPAT). PPARgamma also inhibits adipocyte differentiation by blocking the activity of the transcription factor CEBP / EBPa, which is required for the expression of genes involved in differentiation. PPARgamma is also involved in glucose homeostasis by modulating the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase). PPARgamma is expressed in macrophages and its activation inhibits the expression of proinflammatory genes in macrophages. Activation of PPARgamma in macrophages inhibits the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6.",
  "TNF is a potent cytokine that can induce a variety of cellular responses including apoptosis, inflammation, and the immune response. The cytotoxic effects of TNF are mediated through the 5 5kDa TNF receptor (TNFR1), while the signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory and immune responses are activated through the 75kDa TNF receptor (TNFR2). Upon binding TNF, TNFR1 and TNFR2 recruit a variety of signaling molecules to their cytoplasmic domains to transduce the signal. The death domain of TNFR1 recruits TRADD, which in turn recruits TRAF2, RIP, and the IKKs. TRAF2 and RIP are E3 ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate themselves and other proteins in the complex. The ubiquitination of RIP and TRAF2 by these ligases leads to the activation of the NF-kB pathway and JNK. The recruitment of the IKKs by TNFR1 also requires TRADD and TRAF2. The activation of NF-kB and JNK by TNF is involved in the inflammatory and immune responses. The TNFR2 cytoplasmic domain does not have a death domain and does not recruit TRADD, TRAF2, RIP, or the IKKs. However, TNFR2 does recruit TRAF2 and RIP to activate the NF-kB pathway. TNFR2 also recruits the TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) to activate the non-canonical NF-kB pathway. The activation of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway by TNF does not involve the IKKs, but is mediated by the TRAF proteins and leads to the processing of the NF-kB precursor protein, NFkB2, to produce the p5 2 subunit. The p5 2 / RelB NF-kB heterodimer is a transcription factor that activates genes involved in the immune response and the processing of NF-kB by TNF is involved in the activation of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway.",
  "The activation of glutamate receptors in the mammalian brain is a key component of excitatory synaptic transmission. The binding of glutamate to the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) or NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors on post-synaptic neurons triggers the influx of calcium, which in turn activates calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways that regulate a variety of neuronal functions, including gene expression. The activation of NMDA receptors also leads to the influx of sodium, which depolarizes the membrane and further activates voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of calcium through these channels and through the NMDA receptor triggers a variety of signaling cascades, including the activation of the CaM kinase cascade, the Ras / MAPK cascade, and the PI3 kinase cascade. These signaling pathways converge on the CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) transcription factor, which regulates the expression of genes involved in neuronal survival and plasticity.",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a critical role in development of many different animal phyla. Hh proteins are also involved in the growth and patterning of many adult tissues and are implicated in the development of several human cancers. Hh proteins are expressed in a concentration-dependent manner, with high levels of Hh signaling observed in regions of high Hh concentration, and lower levels of Hh signaling observed in regions of low Hh concentration. The concentration-dependent Hh signaling is achieved through a positive feedback loop in which Hh protein binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptc), releasing Ptc-mediated inhibition of the signaling protein Smoothened (Smo). Signaling through Smo leads to activation of the transcription factors Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3, which then activate transcription of target genes.",
  "TPO is the primary regulator of platelet production. Binding of TPO to its receptor (Mpl) activates a number of signaling pathways. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by TPO through phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors by JAK kinases. The MAPK pathway is also activated by TPO through phosphorylation of MAPK kinases and downstream activation of MAPK. The PI3 kinase pathway is also activated by TPO through phosphorylation of PI3 kinase and AKT. The activation of these pathways leads to increased proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes.",
  "IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation is a key event in the pathogenesis of allergic reactions. Degranulation is triggered by aggregation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) by multivalent antigen-antibody complexes. The aggregation of FcepsilonRI stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) -gamma, which cleaves the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate the second messengers inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 triggers calcium release from intracellular stores, which in turn leads to activation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways, including the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). DAG activates the calcium-dependent protein kinase C (PKD). The activation of PKC and PKD leads to the degranulation response. In addition to the PLC-dependent pathway, there is a PLC-independent pathway that leads to degranulation. This pathway is triggered by the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and leads to the activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The activation of PLA2 leads to the production of arachidonic acid, which is metabolized by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) to produce leukotrienes. The activation of PKC and calcium are also involved in the PLC-independent pathway.",
  "Angiotension II (Ang II) is a peptide hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Ang II is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor angiotensinogen by renin and the protease angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II exerts its effects through two receptors, AT1 and AT2. The AT1 receptor is coupled to a Gq / 1 1 protein to activate phospholipase C, which leads to the formation of IP3 and DAG. IP3 causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores, activating PKC. DAG activates PKC, which activates the Na + / H + exchanger and the sodium / potassium pump. The activation of the sodium / potassium pump leads to an increase in the intracellular sodium concentration, which leads to cellular depolarization and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The activation of the sodium / hydrogen exchanger leads to an increase in intracellular sodium concentration, which activates the sodium / calcium exchanger and the calcium channels. The increase in intracellular calcium activates the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates and activates NFAT, a transcription factor that induces the expression of cytokines and other genes. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway by AT1 receptor also contributes to the activation of NFAT. The activation of the potassium channels and the sodium / hydrogen exchanger leads to cellular depolarization and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The increase in intracellular calcium activates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates and activates NFAT. The activation of the potassium channels and the sodium / hydrogen exchanger leads to an increase in intracellular sodium concentration, which activates the sodium / calcium exchanger and the calcium channels. The increase in intracellular sodium concentration also activates the sodium / potassium-ATPase, which leads to cellular depolarization and activation of the voltage-gated calcium channels. The increase in intracellular calcium activates the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT.",
  "The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit complex that recognizes peptide antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the surface of other cells. The TCR is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for the recognition of specific peptide antigens bound to MHC proteins. The TCR is composed of three chains, the alpha, beta, and gamma chains of the constant region and the variable region of the TCR. The CD3 complex is associated with the TCR and is composed of the CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chains. The CD3 complex is required for the expression of the TCR on the cell surface and is required for signal transduction. The TCR is expressed on the surface of T cells in two forms, the mature form that recognizes antigen bound to MHC, and the immature form that recognizes self-MHC proteins. The mature form of the TCR is expressed on the cell surface in two forms, the naive or effector cell and the memory cell. The expression of the TCR on the cell surface is regulated by the CD3delta and CD3epsilon chains. The CD3delta and CD3epsilon chains are required for the expression of the TCR on the cell surface, but are not required for the formation of the TCR complex. The CD3gamma, CD3gamma / delta, and CD3gamma / epsilon chains are required for the expression of the TCR on the cell surface, but are not required for the formation of the TCR complex. The CD3zeta chain is required for the expression of the TCR on the cell surface, but is not required for the formation of the TCR complex. The CD3zeta chain is required for the expression of the TCR on the cell surface, but is not required for the formation of the TCR complex. The regulation of the expression of the TCR on the cell surface is complex and is dependent on the assembly of the TCR complex in the ER, transport of the complex to the cell surface, recycling of the TCR back to the ER, and degradation of the TCR.",
  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous group of neoplasms derived from the renal epithelium. Approximately 3% of all adult malignancies are renal cell carcinomas. The most common histologic subtype is clear cell RCC (CCRCC), representing 7 5% of all renal cell carcinomas. Papillary RCC (pRCC) accounts for approximately 1 5% of all renal cell carcinomas. The remaining subtypes include chromophobe RCC, collecting duct carcinoma, and unclassified RCC. The molecular pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma is still not well understood. However, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is inactivated in the majority of sporadic CCRCCs, leading to the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and the subsequent up-regulation of several genes involved in angiogenesis, cell survival, and glucose metabolism. Papillary RCCs are associated with activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene. The VHL gene is also inactivated in hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC), an inherited form of renal cancer. The VHL protein (pVHL) is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIF for degradation by the proteasome. Loss of pVHL function results in HIF accumulation and the induction of HIF-dependent genes.",
  "TNF-alpha is a cytokine that induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types. TNF-alpha induces apoptosis through two distinct cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. The TNFR1 receptor is a member of the TNF receptor gene family and is activated by TNF-alpha. The TNFR2 receptor is a member of the nerve growth factor receptor gene family and is not activated by TNF-alpha. The binding of TNF-alpha to the TNFR1 receptor induces the recruitment of several proteins to the receptor to form a signaling complex. The recruitment of TRADD, FADD and TRAF2 to the TNFR1 receptor induces the activation of the NF-kB transcription factor and the apoptotic protease cascade. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 is involved in the anti-apoptotic function of TNF-alpha. The activation of the apoptotic protease cascade by the TNFR1 receptor is involved in the apoptotic function of TNF-alpha. The activation of the apoptotic protease cascade by TNFR1 is inhibited by the recruitment of the proteins TRAF2, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 to the receptor. The activation of NF-kB by TNFR1 is involved in the anti-apoptotic function of TNF-alpha.",
  "The immune system is a complex network of cells that respond to signals from other cells and communicate with other cells to coordinate the response to foreign materials, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, with the goal of eliminating them. The antigen-presenting cell (APC), or antigen-presenting cell, is central to this network. The APC is the cell that presents antigen to T cells in the immune response. Macrophages and dendritic cells are two types of APC. Macrophages are tissue macrophages that are involved in innate immunity and phagocytose foreign materials. Dendritic cells are a type of APC that are found in the skin and other tissues and are responsible for the initiation of the adaptive immune response. Macrophages and dendritic cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and costimulatory molecules to present antigen to T cells. Macrophages and dendritic cells also produce cytokines and chemokines that alert other cells in the immune system and stimulate the response of other cells. The response of T cells is determined by the nature of the antigen presented by the APC and the cytokines produced by the APC. T cells are classified into different types based on their receptors and the nature of the signals they receive from the APC and the APC-stimulated cells. Th1 cells respond to antigen presented by MHC-II molecules together with IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Th2 cells respond to antigen presented by MHC-II molecules together with IL-4 and IL-13. The Th1 and Th2 cells produce different cytokines and stimulate different immune responses.",
  "Phagocytosis is the process by which cells engulf and remove large extracellular particles and / or particles of cells. The process of phagocytosis is triggered by the interaction of the Fc portion of IgG with Fc gamma receptors on the surface of the cell. The signal is transmitted through the Fc gamma receptor and leads to actin polymerization and membrane extension around the particle, followed by the internalization of the particle.",
  "Laminins are a family of large, complex glycoproteins that are major constituents of basement membranes. They are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, proliferation, motility, survival, and apoptosis. The laminin family is comprised of at least 1 5 distinct polypeptides, which are classified into two groups based on their size and structure. The long alpha-helical coiled-coil rod domain is common to all laminin subunits. The N-terminal globule-like globule domain is unique to each laminin subunit. The various functions of laminins are mediated through specific interactions between the different subunits. The binding of laminin to the cell surface is mediated by the integrin receptors. Integrins are a family of cell surface adhesion molecules that consist of noncovalently associated alpha- and beta-subunits. The interaction of laminins with integrins is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and proliferation. The binding of laminins to integrins activates several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway.",
  "The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is a key regulator of actin polymerization. Mutations in WASP lead to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, and an increased incidence of infection due to defects in the immune system. The WASP protein is involved in the formation of actin-based structures such as filopodia, lamellapodia, and podosomes. The activity of WASP is regulated by interaction with several different proteins. The WASP-interacting protein (WIP) stabilizes WASP and increases its activity. The tyrosine kinase Abl phosphorylates WASP and down-regulates its activity. The GTPase Cdc4 2 activates WASP and induces the formation of filopodia. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a key component of the actin polymerization machinery. The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by N-WASP and WASP in a Cdc4 2-dependent manner. The Arp2 / 3 complex induces the formation of a branched actin network, which provides the force necessary for membrane protrusion and cell motility. The activity of WASP is regulated by several different factors. The tyrosine kinase Abl phosphorylates WASP and down-regulates its activity. The interaction of WASP with Nck and the GTPase Rac activates WASP and induces the formation of filopodia. The interaction of WASP with the protein 14@-@ 3-3 inhibits its activity.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary that acts on multiple tissues to regulate growth and metabolism. In addition to its role in growth, GH also has important actions on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and hematopoietic systems. The actions of GH are mediated by the GH receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. The GHR is expressed in many tissues in addition to the pituitary, including the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Binding of GH to its receptor activates multiple signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT, MAPK, and PI 3-kinase pathways. The pathways activated by GH are tissue specific and may be determined by the presence of specific signaling molecules in a particular cell type.",
  "The opioid peptide family includes enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins. These peptides are produced by proteolytic processing of larger precursors, proenkephalin and prodynorphin. The actions of these peptides are mediated by three types of receptors, mu, kappa, and delta. The mu receptor is activated by all three peptides, the kappa receptor by dynorphin, and the delta receptor by enkephalins and endorphins. The three receptors are all G-protein coupled, but the kappa receptor is also known to interact with G-proteins of the Gi family. The three receptors are widely distributed in the brain and are involved in a variety of physiological functions. The mu receptor is involved in pain perception and the delta receptor in analgesia. The kappa receptor is involved in analgesia, euphoria, and respiratory depression. The proenkephalin gene is expressed in a number of regions of the brain, including the basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The prodynorphin gene is expressed in the same regions, but also in the cortex and spinal cord. The expression of proenkephalin and prodynorphin is regulated by a variety of factors, including stress, hormones, and drugs of abuse. The proenkephalin gene is regulated by the transcription factor AP-1, which is activated by the protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The prodynorphin gene is regulated by the transcription factor CREB, which is activated by the cAMP pathway. The enkephalin peptide is released from the presynaptic terminals of enkephalin-containing neurons and acts as a neuromodulator at the postsynaptic neuron. The kappa receptor is found at the postsynaptic neuron and is activated by the enkephalin peptide. The activation of the kappa receptor leads to a decrease in cAMP levels and a reduction in protein kinase A activity. This results in a reduction in the phosphorylation of CREB and a decrease in the expression of CRE-regulated genes. The reduction in CREB phosphorylation and CRE-regulated gene expression may be involved in the analgesic effects of kappa receptor activation. The mu receptor is found at both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The presynaptic mu receptor is involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release. The postsynaptic mu receptor is involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission. The postsynaptic mu receptor is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a reduction in cAMP levels. The reduction in cAMP levels leads to a reduction in the phosphorylation of CREB and CRE-regulated gene expression. The presynaptic mu receptor is involved in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, such as morphine. The presynaptic mu receptor is involved in the euphoric effects of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine. The presynaptic mu receptor is also involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release. The presynaptic mu receptor is found at the presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons and is activated by the enkephalin peptide released from the presynaptic neuron. The activation of the presynaptic mu receptor leads to a reduction in the release of dopamine at the postsynaptic neuron. The modulation of neurotransmitter release by the presynaptic mu receptor may be involved in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse.",
  "Notch signaling is an intercellular signaling pathway that plays a key role in development and is also involved in the pathogenesis of many human cancers. The Notch family of receptors (Notch1-4) are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are activated by binding to Delta-like or Jagged / Serrate family Delta / Serrate / Lag-2 (DSL) ligands on the surface of adjacent cells. Ligand binding induces two consecutive proteolytic cleavages. The first cleavage is mediated by a metalloprotease called 'a disintegrin and metalloprotease' (ADAM) and is required for the release of the Notch receptor from the plasma membrane. The second cleavage is mediated by the gamma-secretase complex and liberates the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes together with the DNA binding protein CSL (CBF1 / Su (H) / Lag-1) and coactivator proteins such as MAML. Notch signaling is negatively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases LNX2 and Deltex, which promote the endocytosis and degradation of Notch receptors.",
  "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a major route by which growth factors regulate cellular proliferation. The ERK cascade is activated by growth factor receptors through Ras, Raf, MEK and ERK. The Crk-associated substrate (CAS) is a scaffold protein that couples tyrosine kinase signaling to the ERK cascade. The CrkII-CAS-Dock1 8 0 complex activates Rac and stimulates the formation of lamellipodia, a process involved in cell motility. The CrkL-C3G complex activates Rap, another small G protein that regulates cell adhesion.",
  "Translation of mRNA into protein occurs in three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Translation initiation begins with the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) complex to the 5 'end of the mRNA. The eIF-4F complex is a group of proteins that binds to the 5' end of mRNA and includes eIF-4A, eIF-4B, eIF-4G, and eIF-3. The eIF-4F complex brings the 4 0S ribosomal subunit to the 5 'end of the mRNA and unwinds the secondary structure in the mRNA to allow the binding of the tRNA and the ribosome to the mRNA. The binding of the eIF-4F complex to the mRNA is regulated by the phosphorylation of eIF-2 and the eIF-4E binding protein (BP). eIF-4E binds to eIF-4G, and the phosphorylation of eIF-4E by MAP kinase increases the affinity of eIF-4E for eIF-4G. The phosphorylation of eIF-2 by the eIF-2alpha kinase also increases the affinity of eIF-2 for eIF-2B. The binding of eIF-4B to eIF-4E and eIF-4G increases the helicase activity of the eIF-4F complex. The binding of eIF-4A to eIF-4F and eIF-4B increases the helicase activity of the eIF-4F complex. The binding of eIF-2 to the tRNA and the ribosome increases the affinity of the tRNA for the ribosome. The termination of translation occurs when the termination factor binds to the ribosome and causes the release of the tRNA and the mRNA. Translation of the polyprotein by the picornaviruses is mediated by a viral protease that cleaves eIF-4G and eIF-2.",
  "The release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores is a key event in many cellular signalling pathways. The inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates intracellular Ca2 + release in response to IP3. The ryanodine receptor is a ligand-gated Ca2 + release channel that mediates Ca2 + release in response to the second messenger cADP-ribose. The Na + / Ca2 + exchanger and the mitochondrial Ca2 + uniporter are the main Ca2 + efflux pathways. Calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca2 + sensor that regulates the activity of many target proteins. The CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the regulation of a large number of cellular processes. The multifunctional Ca2 + / CaM-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) and CaMKIV are involved in the regulation of gene expression and neuronal plasticity. The CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is involved in the regulation of ion channels and synaptic transmission.",
  "The AT1 receptor is coupled to Gq / 1 1 proteins to activate phospholipase C, which in turn catalyzes the formation of two second messengers, IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores, which in turn activates calcium-dependent protein kinases. DAG activates PKC, which also activates other signaling molecules such as the Ras pathway. The AT1 receptor also couples to the G1 2 / 1 3 pathway, which activates the Rho family of small G proteins. The Rho pathway is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression. The AT1 receptor also couples to Gi proteins, which inhibit adenylyl cyclase and thus the Gs-coupled receptor-mediated activation of the cAMP pathway. The AT1 receptor is rapidly internalized upon agonist stimulation. This process is mediated by clathrin-coated pits and is dependent on dynamin. After internalization, the receptor is dephosphorylated and recycled back to the plasma membrane.",
  "ErbB receptors are activated by ligands of the EGF family. The receptors consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The receptors are activated by ligand-induced receptor dimerization, resulting in autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The adaptor proteins GRB2 and CRK are recruited to the activated receptor and link the receptor to the RAS / MAPK pathway and to the CRK / DOCK1 8 0 pathway, respectively. The activation of these pathways leads to proliferation and cell survival. The transcription factor MYC is a convergence point of these pathways.",
  "The neutrophil is a key cell in the innate immune response. It is activated by a variety of signals, including bacterial products, and produces reactive oxygen species and other reactive metabolites to kill bacteria. In addition, it releases a variety of inflammatory mediators that help recruit and activate other immune cells. The response of the neutrophil is coordinated by a variety of signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathways. The neutrophil also plays a role in the inflammatory response to tissue injury, and in some cases can lead to tissue damage. The role of the neutrophil in inflammation is not yet clear, but it may be that the release of reactive oxygen species and other inflammatory mediators by the neutrophil contributes to tissue injury. The neutrophil also plays a role in the resolution of inflammation, and in this role it may also release inflammatory mediators.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The recognition of PAMPs by PRRs leads to the activation of innate immune responses, including the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic PRR that recognizes viral RNA and triggers innate immune responses. Upon recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change and interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), also known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif. This interaction leads to the activation of transcription factors, NF-kB and IRF-3, which induce the expression of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines.",
  "The adaptive immune response is initiated by the recognition of foreign antigens by T cells. T cells are activated by a complex signaling network that includes the T cell receptor (TCR), costimulatory molecules such as CD2 8, and the cytokine milieu of the cell. The combination of these signals determines the fate of the T cell, whether it will proliferate and differentiate to become an effector cell or whether it will survive and become a memory cell. The T cell receptor (TCR) is a complex of the CD3 heterodimer and the TCR-associated proteins TCRzeta, TCRgamma, TCRdelta, and TCReta. The CD3 heterodimer is responsible for the recognition of the antigen and the formation of the complex. The TCRzeta chain is responsible for the association of the complex with the CD3 heterodimer. The CD2 8 coreceptor is responsible for the costimulatory signal. The cytokines provide the third signal. The combination of these signals determines the fate of the T cell.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that signals through the JAK / STAT pathway to regulate a variety of cellular processes including inflammation, hematopoiesis, and acute phase responses. The IL-6 receptor is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha subunit that confers ligand specificity and a beta subunit that is shared with the IL-6 family of cytokines. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor induces dimerization of the receptor subunits and activation of the JAK / STAT pathway. JAK1 and JAK2 are associated with the receptor alpha subunit and are activated by phosphorylation in response to IL-6. The receptor beta subunit associates with the JAK kinases and the adaptor protein Shc. The ras / Map kinase pathway is also activated by IL-6 through recruitment of Shc and Grb2 to the receptor. STAT-3 is activated by phosphorylation by the JAK kinases and translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of responsive genes. The activation of the JAK / STAT pathway by the IL-6 receptor is distinct from that of other cytokine receptors in that it does not require the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor beta subunit. The beta subunit is not required for JAK activation but is required for STAT activation. The beta subunit is also required for activation of the ras / Map kinase pathway. The JAK / STAT and ras / Map kinase pathways are activated by IL-6 with different kinetics and are differentially regulated by the IL-6 receptor. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated within minutes of IL-6 addition to cells while the activation of the ras / Map kinase pathway takes longer to achieve. The difference in kinetics of activation of these two pathways may provide a mechanism for regulating the cellular response to IL-6.",
  "The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. It is activated by a variety of conserved microbial products, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), that are absent from the host. These PAMPs are recognized by a set of host proteins, termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Upon recognition of PAMPs, NLRs and RLRs trigger the assembly of multiprotein complexes termed inflammasomes, which mediate the activation of proinflammatory caspases (caspase-1) and the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, TLRs recruit the adaptor protein MyD8 8, which leads to the activation of NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, the TRIF-dependent pathway leads to the production of type I interferons (IFNs).",
  "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein that plays a key role in patterning the developing CNS. In the developing cerebellum, Shh secreted by Purkinje cells acts as a mitogen on GNPs in the external germinal layer (EGL). Shh signaling promotes proliferation of GNPs by inducing expression of the cell cycle regulator Cyclin D1. Patched (Ptc) is a receptor for Shh that is expressed in GNPs but not in Purkinje cells. Binding of Shh to Ptc relieves inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), a G-protein coupled receptor. Activation of Smo leads to activation of the Gli family of transcription factors, induction of Cyclin D1, and progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to the S phase. In addition to inducing proliferation, Shh signaling also blocks differentiation of GNPs. The role of Shh signaling in the development of medulloblastoma, a cancer of the cerebellum, has also been investigated. About 2 0% of human medulloblastomas have amplification of the Shh pathway transcription factor, Gli1. Constitutively active Smo mutations have also been identified in a small percentage of human medulloblastomas.",
  "ErbB receptors are a family of four closely related cell surface receptors (EGFR / ErbB-1, ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4) that bind at least seven different polypeptide growth factor ligands. The best characterized ligands for the ErbB receptors are EGF, TGF-alpha, HB-EGF and neuregulins (also known as NDF / heregulins). These ligands are synthesized as transmembrane precursors that are proteolytically cleaved to release soluble growth factors. The soluble growth factors bind to the receptor ectodomains, inducing receptor dimerization and activation. The ErbB receptors are structurally similar, consisting of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Ligand-induced receptor dimerization leads to the autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues and the recruitment of a variety of signaling molecules, including the tyrosine kinases src and p21 0c-, the adaptor proteins GRB2 and SHC, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the adaptor protein GAB1. The net result of these molecular interactions is the activation of multiple signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, differentiation and migration.",
  "The interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium is a key step in the inflammatory response. The adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium is a multistep process involving the initial rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium, followed by firm adhesion and diapedesis of the leukocytes into the tissue. The rolling of leukocytes is mediated by the interaction of P-, E- and L-selectins with their ligands on the endothelium. The firm adhesion of leukocytes is mediated by the interaction of beta2 integrins with their endothelial ligands. The interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium is also regulated by the expression of adhesion molecules such as CD4 0L and CD4 0.",
  "The cell cycle is regulated by the sequential activation of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their inhibitors. The CDKs are a family of serine / threonine kinases that are positively regulated by association with cyclins and negatively regulated by CDK inhibitors. The activity of CDKs is further regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The activity of CDKs is highest during the S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle and is lowest during the G1 phase. The activity of CDKs is regulated by phosphorylation of threonine 1 6 0 (T1 6 0) and tyrosine 1 5 (Y1 5). Phosphorylation of T1 6 0 by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) activates the kinase activity of CDKs. The activity of CDKs is inhibited by phosphorylation of T1 4 and Y1 5 by the Wee1 and Myt1 kinases and dephosphorylation of these residues by the CDC2 5 phosphatase. The activity of CDC2 5 is positively regulated by phosphorylation by the kinases from the MAP kinase pathway. The activity of CDKs is also regulated by the interaction with CDK inhibitors (CKIs). CKIs include p15, p16, p18, p21 and p27. The p15 and p16 are encoded by the same gene and are often referred to as p15 and p16. The p15 and p16 are expressed in all cells but their expression is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The expression of p15 is high in G1 and is degraded in S phase by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. The expression of p16 is high in G1 and is degraded in S phase. The p15 and p16 form a complex with CDKs and inhibit their kinase activity. The CDK inhibitors are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle in response to extracellular signals. The p15 and p16 are induced by the DNA damage checkpoint pathway and block the cell cycle progression at the G1-S transition. The p18 and p21 inhibit CDKs and the replication of damaged DNA.",
  "The NFAT family of transcription factors are activated by the calcium / calcineurin signaling pathway. The NFAT transcription factors are involved in the regulation of genes involved in T cell activation, cardiac hypertrophy, and skeletal muscle development. The NFAT family members are regulated by a conserved regulatory domain that contains a series of serine residues that are targets of phosphorylation by the kinases GSK-3 and cdk9. The phosphorylation of these sites creates a binding site for the 1 4-3-3 proteins, which sequester NFAT in the cytoplasm. The binding of calmodulin and calcineurin to NFAT displaces the 1 4-3-3 proteins and allows NFAT to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The activity of NFAT is regulated by the opposing actions of kinases and phosphatases. The kinases that phosphorylate NFAT include cdk9 and GSK-3. The phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT is calcineurin. Calcineurin is activated by the increase in intracellular calcium that results from the activation of the T cell receptor. The activation of T cells by antigen-presenting cells results in the activation of phospholipase C and the production of IP3 and DAG. IP3 causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores. The increase in intracellular calcium activates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The activation of NFAT by the calcium / calcineurin pathway is involved in the regulation of genes involved in T cell activation. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A block T cell activation and are used as immunosuppressants to prevent transplant rejection. The activation of NFAT by the calcium / calcineurin pathway is also involved in the regulation of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy and skeletal muscle development. Calcineurin inhibitors block cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload and in response to the expression of activated ras in the heart. Calcineurin inhibitors also block the hypertrophy of skeletal muscle induced by the expression of activated ras in skeletal muscle. The activation of NFAT by the calcium / calcineurin pathway is also involved in the regulation of genes involved in skeletal muscle development. The activation of NFAT by the calcium / calcineurin pathway is also involved in the regulation of genes involved in the development of slow muscle fibers. The expression of slow skeletal muscle genes is regulated by the transcription factor Mef2. Mef2 is activated by the calcium / calcineurin pathway and activates the slow fiber program by inducing the expression of slow fiber type specific genes such as TnnC and MLC-1. The expression of slow fiber type genes is opposed by the transcription factor MyoD, which induces the fast muscle program. MyoD induces the expression of genes involved in fast muscle fiber development such as MyHC2. The opposing actions of Mef2 and MyoD on fiber type gene expression are regulated by calcineurin-dependent phosphorylation of MyoD. Calcineurin-dependent phosphorylation of MyoD increases its DNA binding activity and decreases its transcriptional activity.",
  "The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is activated by a set of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), that recognize conserved microbial components known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon recognition of PAMPs, a series of signaling cascades are triggered, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN). These cytokines are essential for activating the adaptive immune response and are involved in the elimination of infectious agents. Tightly regulated activation of these pathways is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. Several negative regulators of TLR signaling have been identified, including IRAK-M, SOCS, and SIGIRR.",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen for a variety of cell types. IGF-1 binds to its receptor, which is a tyrosine kinase, and activates several signaling pathways. One pathway leads to the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAPK pathway and activates transcription of genes through the transcription factor AP-1. Another pathway leads to activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway and activation of the transcription factor ELK-1. Both pathways converge on the ETS transcription factor family member SHC. The net effect of these pathways is to activate transcription of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is a key regulatory step in receptor-mediated endocytosis. The assembly of clathrin and the adaptor protein AP2 into a lattice on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane is the driving force for vesicle formation. The GTPase dynamin is required for the final fission event. The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is also involved in other cellular processes such as the formation of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals. The assembly of clathrin and AP2 is regulated by the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI (4, 5) P2). The conversion of PI (4, 5) P2 to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) by the phosphatase synaptojanin releases clathrin and AP2 from the membrane and terminates vesicle formation. The adaptor protein AP1 8 0 is involved in the assembly of clathrin and AP2 into a lattice on the Golgi. The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is also regulated by phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain. The protein kinase casein kinase 1phosphorylates clathrin heavy chain and stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The protein phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylates clathrin heavy chain and deactivates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is also regulated by the adaptor protein epsin. Epsin binds to both clathrin and AP2 and is involved in the assembly of clathrin and AP2 into a lattice on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. Epsin also interacts with ubiquitin and is involved in the internalization of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that regulates the assembly of clathrin and AP2. Calmodulin is also involved in the regulation of other steps in endocytosis such as the disassembly of clathrin-coated pits. Calmodulin binds to the ear domain of the alpha-adaptin subunit of AP2. The ear domain of alpha-adaptin is also the site of interaction for the epsin, amphiphysin1 and synaptojanin 1 proteins.",
  "Mucin-2 (Muc2) is a high molecular weight glycoprotein that is secreted by a variety of epithelial tissues. In the intestine, Muc2 is the major component of the mucus layer that lines the intestinal tract and protects it from abrasive injury and infection. Muc2 is also a component of the stool and is a marker of intestinal disease. Muc2 is produced by intestinal goblet cells and its expression is regulated by a variety of factors including hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and environmental stress. In addition to its role as a protective barrier, Muc2 may also act as a signaling molecule. Muc2 interacts with a variety of signaling molecules including growth factors, cytokines, and integrins. Muc2 interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through its EGF-like repeats and activates the EGFR signaling pathway. Muc2 also interacts with p38 kinases through an as yet unidentified protein. The interaction of Muc2 with p38 kinases may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis by Muc2.",
  "Granzyme B is a protease released by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells that induces apoptosis in target cells by cleaving and activating caspases. Granzyme B is packaged in the granules of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells and is released into the synapse with a target cell. The target cell then expresses Fas ligand, which binds to Fas on the target cell and initiates apoptosis. Granzyme B activates caspases by cleaving Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, to form a fragment that translocates to the mitochondria and activates cytochrome c release. Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria and activates Apaf-1, which activates caspase-9. Caspase-9 then activates caspase-3 and other caspases that lead to apoptosis. Granzyme A is also a protease released by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells that induces apoptosis in target cells. Granzyme A cleaves Bid to activate cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Granzyme A also activates caspases directly. The ability of Granzyme A to induce apoptosis in target cells is not dependent on caspases.",
  "DNA damage checkpoints are signal transduction pathways that provide a mechanism to delay cell cycle progression and allow time for repair of damaged DNA. The ATM kinase is a key component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway and is activated by double-stranded DNA breaks. ATM phosphorylates and activates downstream checkpoint kinases, chk1 and chk2, that phosphorylate and regulate downstream targets to halt the cell cycle and allow time for DNA repair. The breast cancer susceptibility gene product, BRCA1, is also involved in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. The breast cancer susceptibility gene product interacts with checkpoint proteins and is required for the activation of the checkpoint response to DNA damage. The BRCA2 gene product interacts with the recombinase RAD5 1 and is required for homologous recombination, a process that repairs DNA damage by copying the sequence of a damaged DNA strand into the undamaged strand. The ATR kinase is another checkpoint kinase that is activated by DNA damage and is required for the DNA damage checkpoint response. ATR interacts with the checkpoint clamp complex RAD1-RAD5and phosphorylates and activates chk1 and chk2. ATR also interacts with the checkpoint kinase Chk1, and phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR is required for the activation of Chk1 by other checkpoint kinases. The interaction of ATR with the checkpoint clamp complex may allow ATR to respond to DNA damage at a very early stage, before the DNA has been damaged, and to respond to a variety of DNA damage.",
  "The Wnt / Frizzled pathway is one of several evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that are involved in the control of cell fate and tissue patterning during development. Secreted Wnt proteins bind to cell-surface receptors of the Frizzled family, and the coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP). This leads to the formation of a ternary complex between Wnt, Frizzled and LRP, which initiates a variety of cellular responses, including the stabilization of beta-catenin and the activation of TCF-dependent transcription. In the absence of Wnt, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by a complex containing axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), and the tumor suppressor protein APC, and is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Wnt binding to Frizzled leads to the inhibition of GSK-3beta, resulting in the stabilization of beta-catenin, its accumulation in the cytoplasm, and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. In the nucleus, beta-catenin displaces TCF-4 from Groucho and activates gene expression. Several Wnt genes are expressed in the developing CNS, and Wnts are involved in the regulation of proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Wnt-3A, -5A, and -7A are expressed in the developing CNS, and can act as both proliferative and differentiative signals. Wnt-3A can induce proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors, and can block the differentiation of these cells induced by retinoic acid. Wnt-5A can also induce proliferation, but inhibits neuronal differentiation. Wnt-7A, on the other hand, can induce neuronal differentiation without affecting proliferation. Wnt-3A can also act as a survival factor for cultured cortical neurons, and can block the apoptotic cell death of these cells induced by trophic factor withdrawal.",
  "Pancreatic islet cells are derived from a common progenitor cell during development. The endocrine cells of the pancreas include the insulin-secreting beta-cells, the glucagon-secreting alpha-cells, the somatostatin-secreting delta-cells, and the pancreatic polypeptide-secreting PP-cells. Each of these cell types is derived from a distinct precursor cell that expresses a unique set of transcription factors. The bHLH factor Pdx-1 is required for the development of all four islet cell types. The paired-box factor Pax4 is required for the development of the beta- and delta-cells, while the paired-like homeodomain factor Pax6 is required for the development of the alpha- and PP-cells. The NK2 homeobox factor Nkx2. 2 is required for the development of the beta- and delta-cells, while the homeo-domain factor Isl-1 is required for the development of the alpha- and PP-cells. The hormone genes expressed in mature islet cells are regulated by these transcription factors during development.",
  "DNA replication is a highly conserved process that occurs in all organisms. In eukaryotes, DNA replication occurs at multiple levels, including initiation, leading-strand replication, and lagging-strand replication. In eukaryotic cells, DNA replication is a complex process that requires the coordinate action of many proteins. At the replication fork, a DNA helicase called the MCM complex (mini-chromosome maintenance complex) unwinds the parental DNA duplex and provides the single-stranded DNA template for DNA replication. DNA polymerase alpha-primase (pol alpha-primase), a complex of DNA primase and DNA polymerase alpha, synthesizes RNA and DNA primers for the leading and lagging-strand DNA polymerases. DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) and DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon) replicate the leading and lagging DNA strands, respectively. The switch from DNA primase to DNA polymerase delta is facilitated by replication factor C. DNA ligase I seals the nick in the DNA.",
  "The immune system is comprised of two distinct cell types, the lymphocytes and the macrophages. Macrophages are the body's sentinels that respond to infection and injury by secreting cytokines and chemokines that alert the immune system. Macrophages are also involved in the removal of apoptotic cells and the removal of cellular debris. The macrophage is a highly specialized cell that must respond to a variety of signals in order to carry out its role. One of the signals that macrophages receive to respond is the cytokine interleukin-1 5 (IL-1 5). IL-1 5 is a cytokine that is secreted by a variety of cells in the body in response to infection or injury. Macrophages respond to IL-1 5 by increasing the expression of adhesion molecules on their cell surface, increasing their migration to the site of inflammation, and inducing the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. The response of macrophages to IL-1 5 is distinct from the response of lymphocytes to IL-1 5. Macrophages do not express the IL-1 5 receptor alpha chain (IL-1 5Ralpha), but respond to IL-1 5 by increasing the expression of the IL-1 5Ralpha on their cell surface. The response of macrophages to IL-1 5 is similar to the response of lymphocytes to IL-2. Macrophages respond to IL-1 5 by increasing the expression of adhesion molecules on their cell surface, increasing their migration to the site of inflammation, and inducing the secretion of cytokines and chemokines.

  "The cell cycle is a series of events that results in the duplication of genetic material and the subsequent division of the cell into two daughter cells. The cell cycle is regulated by a complex network of proteins that interact to control the transition from one phase of the cell cycle to the next. Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of proteins that regulate the cell cycle. The activity of CDKs is dependent on the binding of a cyclin subunit and the presence of a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI). The activity of the CDKs is negatively regulated by the INK4 family of proteins (p15, p16, p18, p19) and positively regulated by the Cip / Kip family of CKIs (p2 1, p16, p18). The Cip / Kip family of CKIs includes p2 1, p16, and p18. The Cip / Kip family of CKIs bind to the CDK / cyclin complex and block the phosphorylation of downstream targets that are required for cell cycle progression. The Cip / Kip family of CKIs also interact with a variety of other proteins to regulate cell cycle progression and other cellular processes. The p16 gene encodes two splice variants, p16Ink4a and p16Arf. The p16Ink4a protein interacts with Cdk4 and Cdk6 to inhibit the phosphorylation of the RB protein and block the progression of the cell from G1 to S. The p16Ink4a protein also interacts with MDM2 to block the ability of MDM2 to negatively regulate the tumor suppressor protein p5 3. The p16Ink4a gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted or mutated in a variety of human cancers. The p16Ink4a protein also interacts with the MDM2 protein to block MDM2 mediated degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p5 3. The p16Ink4a protein is induced by the p53 protein in response to DNA damage to block cell cycle progression and allow DNA repair. The p16Ink4a gene is also a transcriptional target of p53. The p16Arf protein interacts with MDM2 to block degradation of the p5 3 protein and activate the p5 3 tumor suppressor pathway. The p16Ink4a and p16Arf proteins are both required for the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the prevention of tumor formation by p53. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated or deleted in a large number of human cancers. The p53 protein is activated in response to a variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage, to induce the expression of genes that block cell cycle progression and allow repair of damaged DNA. The p16Ink4a and p16Arf proteins block the interaction of MDM2 with p5 3 to block degradation of the p53 protein and activate the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated or deleted in a large number of human cancers.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone that regulates growth and metabolism. In addition to its endocrine actions, GH acts as a local factor in many tissues. In the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, GH acts as a local factor to stimulate growth. The mechanism by which GH acts as a local factor is not well understood. One possibility is that the local action of GH is mediated by a different set of signaling molecules than the systemic action of GH. In this study, we examined the role of the small GTPase Ras in the cardiac and hepatic actions of GH. Ras is a key signaling molecule that regulates many cellular functions, including cell growth and differentiation. Ras is activated by many factors, including growth factors and cytokines. In addition to activating Ras, growth factors also activate Ras-activated kinases, including Map kinases. Ras activates Map kinases, including Erk1 and Erk2, which phosphorylate transcription factors such as ELK-1 and ATF2. In this study, we found that Ras is activated by GH in the heart and liver. In addition, we found that Ras is required for the cardiac and hepatic growth induced by GH. Ras activates multiple signaling pathways, including the Map kinase pathway. We found that Ras activates the Map kinase pathway in the heart and liver in response to GH. In addition, we found that the transcription factor CREB is activated by GH in a Ras-dependent manner. CREB is a transcription factor that is activated by phosphorylation by Map kinases. These results indicate that Ras is a key mediator of the cardiac and hepatic growth induced by GH. In addition, these results indicate that Ras activates multiple signaling pathways in response to GH.",
  "Bone marrow stromal cells are a heterogeneous population of cells that include fibroblasts, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and other cell types. The major function of stromal cells is to provide a structural support for hematopoiesis. Stromal cells also produce cytokines that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Cytokines produced by stromal cells include IL-3, IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-10, and TNF. IL-10 and TGF-beta are anti-inflammatory cytokines that inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines produced by hematopoietic cells include IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a polypeptide hormone that has a high degree of structural and functional similarity to proinsulin. IGF-1 is produced in the liver and acts on a wide variety of tissues, stimulating growth and differentiation. IGF-1 is also produced in the brain and acts as a neurotrophic factor. IGF-1 acts through the IGF-1 receptor, a tyrosine kinase closely related to the insulin receptor. IGF-1 is an important growth factor in vivo and has been implicated in the growth of many types of cancer. IGF-1 is also involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and may be involved in the development of type II diabetes. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen and can act as a survival factor in neurons. The IGF-1 receptor is a heterodimer with alpha and beta subunits. The beta subunit is the tyrosine kinase portion of the receptor and is similar to the insulin receptor. Binding of IGF-1 to the IGF-1 receptor activates several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, and the protein kinase Akt pathway. The IGF-1 receptor is widely expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of neuronal survival and differentiation. IGF-1 also stimulates the proliferation of neural precursor cells.",
  "The proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades intracellular proteins. It is composed of two subunits-- the 20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle. The 20S core particle is a cylinder-shaped structure consisting of four stacked rings each with seven subunits each. The two outer rings each contain subunits 13PA7 and 1PA6, and the two inner rings each contain 1PA8 and 1PA9. The 19S regulatory particle is responsible for recognizing, unfolding, and cleaving peptides from proteins that are to be degraded. Proteins to be degraded are first tagged with a chain of ubiquitin, and then recognized by the 19S regulatory particle. The 19S regulatory particle contains six subunits that are responsible for binding the ubiquitin chain, and two subunits that open the gate in the 20S core particle to allow entry of the protein to be degraded. Once the protein is unfolded, it can enter the 20S core particle, where it is cleaved by the proteases PA28 and PA20. the PA28 subunit is a chymotrypsin-like protease, and the PA20. subunit is a trypsin-like protease.",
  "The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a G-protein coupled receptor that is activated by the chemokine ligand CXCL1 2. CXCR4 is expressed on the surface of many cell types, including lymphocytes, and is involved in lymphocyte chemotaxis, activation, and development. The CXCR4 receptor is also expressed in some types of cancer, where it may play a role in metastasis.

The activation of these pathways leads to changes in cellular morphology and motility.",
  "The hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that plays a key role in oxygen homeostasis and adaptation to low oxygen levels (hypoxia). HIF-1 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors. It is a nuclear protein that is maintained at a low level under normoxic conditions. O2-dependent regulation of HIF-1 is mediated by the HIF-1 prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). These enzymes use oxygen as a substrate to catalyze the hydroxylation of two prolines in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) of HIF-1alpha. This modification targets HIF-1alpha for ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the proteasome. Severe hypoxia or exposure to hypoxia-mimicking agents inhibits the activity of PHDs, leading to HIF-1 activation. HIF-1 activates the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in oxygen transport (EPO), glycolysis (HK1, HK2), and P9orf1ba, a gene involved in hypoxic adaptation. HIF-1 also inhibits the expression of genes encoding angiogenic factors such as VEGF.",
  "Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. They are essential for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The biologically active form of vitamin A is all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). ATRA is used clinically for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA induces differentiation of APL cells and has a therapeutic effect. However, ATRA has a short half-life and causes side effects such as nightmares, insomnia, and skin dryness. In addition, ATRA-resistant APL cells frequently develop. Therefore, there is a need to develop new synthetic retinoids with improved therapeutic index. This review summarizes the progress made in the development of synthetic retinoids. The synthetic retinoids are classified into two groups: 1) conformationally restricted retinoids and 2) conformationally flexible retinoids. The conformationally restricted retinoids include the benzamides, benzoic acids, and aroylazacyclopentan-2-ones. The conformationally flexible retinoids include the tetrahydronaphthalenes, piperidinols, and chromenes. The conformationally restricted retinoids are represented by the classical retinoids, which include the aroylazacyclopentan-2-ones, and the non-classical retinoids, which include the benzamides and benzoic acids. The non-classical retinoids are structurally diverse and include the chromenes, chromanones, and the chromanylchromanones. The conformationally restricted retinoids are represented by the benzamides, benzoic acids, and aroylazacyclopentan-2-ones.

The lymphoid cells include lymphocytes, the cells responsible for the immune response, and the lymphoid tissues that contain the lymphoid cells. The nonlymphoid system consists of the tissues that produce and deliver the humoral factors of the immune system, such as antibodies and complement. The humoral factors of the immune system include antibodies and the cytokines that are secreted by the lymphocytes.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit complex that recognizes specific antigens in the form of short peptides bound to MHC molecules. The TCR is composed of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma, which are associated with the membrane proteins CD3-gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta. The CD3 subunits are noncovalently associated with the TCR subunits and are required for TCR expression and function. The CD3 subunits are also associated with the protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn that are required for TCR signaling. The Thy-1 glycoprotein is a minor component of the thymocyte cell surface that is not associated with the TCR. Thy-1 is expressed on a variety of cell types, including neurons, and is not associated with the TCR. Thy-1 is anchored to the cell membrane by a glycophosphatidylinositol linkage, and is found in the extracellular space. Thy-1 is not required for T cell development, but may play a role in T cell activation.",
  "Cell-cell adhesion is essential for many biological processes including hemostasis, the immune response, and development of the cardiovascular system. The first step in cell-cell adhesion is the recognition of cell surface molecules on apposing cells. Selectins are a family of cell surface glycoproteins that function as adhesion molecules by binding to carbohydrates on the surface of other cells. Selectins are expressed on the surface of leukocytes and mediate their initial attachment to activated platelets and the vascular endothelium during the inflammatory response. Selectins are also expressed on the surface of platelets and mediate their initial attachment to the vascular endothelium during hemostasis. The selectins bind to carbohydrates on the surface of other cells and are involved in the rolling of leukocytes along the vascular endothelium during inflammation and in the initial stages of hemostasis. The selectins are also expressed on the surface of platelets and mediate their initial attachment to the vascular endothelium during hemostasis. The selectins are comprised of three members: P-, E-, and L-selectin. Each selectin is expressed on the surface of a different cell type and binds to different carbohydrates on the surface of other cells. P-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated platelets and is involved in the initial attachment of platelets to the vascular endothelium during hemostasis. E-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells and is involved in the initial attachment of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium during inflammation. L-selectin is expressed on the surface of leukocytes and mediates their initial attachment to the vascular endothelium during inflammation. The carbohydrate ligands for the selectins are a family of sulfated, branched, polylactosamine type O-glycans. The expression of these glycans is regulated by a series of genes called the \"histo-blood group\" genes. The histo-blood group genes encode glycosyltransferases that synthesize the histo-blood group antigens on the surface of red blood cells and leukocytes. The expression of these histo-blood group antigens is regulated by a process called \"glycosilation,\" in which glycosyltransferases modify the histo-blood group antigens in a specific manner. The histo-blood group antigens are also expressed on the surface of platelets and mediate their initial attachment to the vascular endothelium during hemostasis. The histo-blood group antigens are also expressed on the surface of many other cell types and are involved in many other biological processes.",
  "The inflammatory response is a complex process involving the coordinated expression of a variety of genes. The expression of many of these genes is regulated by the transcription factor NF-kB. NF-kB is a heterodimer of p5 0 and p6 5 subunits. The p5 0 subunit is expressed at a higher level than the p6 5 subunit in most cells. In the absence of an activating signal, NF-kB is retained in the cytoplasm by association with an inhibitory protein, I-kB. Various inflammatory stimuli, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activate a signaling pathway that results in the phosphorylation of I-kB, its ubiquitination and degradation, and the release of NF-kB for nuclear translocation. NF-kB activates transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of target genes. The activation of NF-kB by LPS is mediated by the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The signaling pathway that leads to I-kB phosphorylation and degradation and the subsequent activation of NF-kB by LPS is similar to that used by a variety of other extracellular stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The Toll-like receptor 4 is a member of a family of proteins that mediate the inflammatory response to bacterial products. The signaling pathway that leads from the Toll-like receptor 4 to NF-kB activation has not been fully elucidated, but involves the adaptor protein MyD8 8, the protein kinase IRAK-1, and the I-kB kinase (IKK) complex. The NF-kB activation by LPS is transient, lasting only a few hours. The I-kB kinase complex is one target of negative regulation in the NF-kB activation pathway. The I-kB kinase complex is also a component of the signaling pathway that leads from the T-cell receptor to NF-kB activation. The I-kB kinase complex is also involved in the activation of NFkB by other stimuli, including those that do not activate the Toll-like receptor 4, such as the activation of NF-kB by the T-cell receptor. The activation of NF-kB by LPS and other stimuli is opposed by the tumor suppressor protein p53. The p53 inhibits NF-kB activation by binding to the I-kB kinase complex, preventing its activation. The p53 gene is a transcriptional target of NF-kB, providing a negative feedback loop for the activation of NF-kB by inflammatory stimuli.",
  "Growth factors bind to their receptors and activate signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors includes EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and betacellulin. These growth factors are synthesized as transmembrane precursors that are proteolytically cleaved to release a soluble, active factor. The EGF receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, which also includes ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4. Binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The major signaling pathways activated by the EGFR include the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway. Ras activates the Raf kinase, which phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinase cascade. PI3-K phosphorylates phosphoinositides, which activate the protein kinase AKT. Activation of AKT inhibits apoptosis and stimulates cell survival. The ErbB receptors also activate the Stat transcription factors, which induce expression of genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 that regulate cell proliferation. The ErbB receptors are frequently over-expressed or mutated in human cancers, and activation of these receptors can contribute to tumor formation and progression.",
  "The breakdown of glycogen releases glucose 1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Glucose-6-phosphate is the precursor of all glucose in the cell, and is converted to glucose-1-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. Glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. The next step in glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme phosphofructokinase to produce fructose-6-phosphate. Fructose-6-phosphate is isomerized by the enzyme fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase to produce fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate and inorganic phosphate. Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate is converted to yield another molecule of fructose-6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. The next step in glycolysis is the phosphorylation of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate to produce fructose-6-phosphate. Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase to produce glucose-1-phosphate. The final step in glycolysis is the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to yield pyruvate and inorganic phosphate. The pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. The acetyl-CoA is converted to citrate by the enzyme citrate synthase. The citrate is transported to the mitochondria where it is converted to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, which are then used to generate the other metabolic pathways.",
  "The interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is a key event in the activation of T cells. The interaction is mediated by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the MHC-bound peptide. The interaction is also regulated by costimulatory molecules. The CD2 8 molecule is a costimulatory molecule that is expressed on the T cell surface and binds B7 (CD8 0 and CD8 6) molecules on the APC. The interaction of CD2 8 with B7 molecules provides a second signal that is required for full T-cell activation. The interaction of the T cell receptor with the MHC-bound peptide and B7 provides the first signal. The second signal provided by CD2 8 is required for full T-cell activation. The interaction of CD2 8 with B7 is also involved in the regulation of T-cell responses. The interaction of CTLA-4 with B7 provides a negative signal that down-regulates T-cell responses. The interaction of T cells with APCs is also regulated by other costimulatory molecules. The inducible T cell costimulatory molecule (ICOS) is a member of the CD2 8 family that shares many of the same functions as CD2 8. The interaction of ICOS with its ligand B7x provides a second signal that is required for T-cell activation. The interaction of ICOS with B7x is involved in the regulation of T-cell responses. The Programmed death-1 (PD-1) molecule is another member of the CD2 8 family that is involved in the regulation of T-cell responses. The interaction of PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1 or PD-L2 provides a second signal that down-regulates T-cell responses.",
  "The protease-activated GPCRs are a family of GPCRs that are activated by proteases rather than peptide hormones. The protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four GPCRs that are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminus to reveal a new N-terminal sequence that functions as a tethered ligand. This new N-terminus functions as a peptide ligand that activates the receptor and is subsequently removed by an aminopeptidase. The tethered ligand can be unmasked by synthetic peptides corresponding to the newly created N-terminus. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the new N-terminus of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 can activate the PARs in the absence of cleavage. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the new N-terminus of PAR1 and PAR2 can also activate the protease-activated receptors in the absence of cleavage. The tethered ligand can also be unmasked by peptides corresponding to the newly created N-terminus of PAR3. The PAR receptors are widely expressed in the cardiovascular, central nervous, and immune systems. Activation of the PARs by thrombin and other proteases can lead to cellular responses that can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on the cellular and disease context.",
  "The immune system consists of two major components, the lymphoid cells and the nonlymphoid cells. The lymphoid cells are formed from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through a series of differentiation steps, called hematopoiesis, in the bone marrow. The HSCs differentiate into common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which give rise to T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) differentiate into granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), which produce the myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. The megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) differentiate into the common erythrocyte-granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (EGPs), which produce megakaryocytes and erythrocytes.",
  "The 5HTR is a receptor for serotonin (5HT) that is expressed in the central nervous system and in the gastrointestinal tract. The 5HTR is coupled to the Gq / 1 1 family of G proteins. Activation of the 5HTR stimulates phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to form inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol trisphosphate causes release of intracellular calcium, and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. Activation of the 5HTR also stimulates the MAP kinase pathway through a G protein-independent mechanism involving transactivation of the EGF receptor. The 5HTR is involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions including learning and memory, feeding behavior, and gastrointestinal motility.",
  "The protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a unique family of GPCRs activated by proteolytic cleavage of their extracellular N-termini to reveal a tethered peptide ligand that binds and activates the receptor. The tethered ligand sequences of the four PARs are SFLLRN (PAR1), GYPGQV (PAR2), GYPGQV (PAR4), and SLIGKV (PAR4). Synthetic peptides corresponding to these sequences can activate the receptor and are referred to as PAR-APs. The tethered ligand peptides are not present in the intact receptor and are not found in plasma or extracellular matrix. The PAR-APs are generated by the limited proteolysis of extracellular proteins by a family of proteases that includes trypsin, tryptase, and coagulation factors VIIa and Xa. The PAR-APs are the first known examples of cellular ligands that are activated by proteolysis.

  "Neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) are released from presynaptic nerve terminals and bind to specific receptors on the surface of postsynaptic neurons. These receptors are coupled to a variety of signal transduction pathways, including the Gs, Gi, Gq and Gi / o families of heterotrimeric G proteins. The activation of Gs-coupled receptors leads to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase and the production of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (PKA). The activation of Gi-coupled receptors leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and a reduction in cAMP levels. The activation of Gq-coupled receptors leads to the activation of phospholipase C and the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to the intracellular receptor, resulting in the release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC).

  "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of structural and functional macromolecules that provides a structural framework for cells and tissues. The ECM also plays a critical role in cell signaling and in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The major components of the ECM are collagen, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. The collagens form a family of fibril-forming proteins that provide tensile strength to tissues. Proteoglycans consist of a core protein with covalently attached glycosaminoglycan chains. Proteoglycans interact with collagen and other ECM components to provide structural support and regulate cell proliferation and migration. Glycoproteins include laminin, fibronectin, and tenascin. The laminin family of glycoproteins provides structural support for tissues and regulates cell adhesion. The extracellular matrix is synthesized and secreted by cells and is continuously remodeled by the combined action of proteolytic enzymes and the action of tissue-derived and secreted metalloproteinases (MMPs). The balance between the synthesis and degradation of ECM components is critical for the maintenance of tissue structure and function. Disruption of this balance can lead to tissue destruction and is associated with a number of pathological conditions. The collagen family of proteins is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as precursors that are cleaved in the Golgi to produce the mature proteins. The propeptide domains of the collagen propeptides inhibit the assembly of collagen monomers into higher order structures. The propeptides are removed from the procollagens in the trans-Golgi network by the action of the enzyme C-proteinase. The removal of the propeptide domains is required for the assembly of collagen monomers into fibrils and fibers. The removal of the propeptide domains is also required for the activation of the collagen-degrading MMPs. The removal of the propeptide domains is regulated by the interaction of the propeptides with the chaperone protein HSP4 7. The collagen-degrading MMPs are secreted as inactive zymogens. The conversion of the inactive zymogen to the active enzyme is regulated by a family of secreted proteins called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The activity of the MMPs is also regulated by the action of a family of ECM-associated proteinase inhibitors (cystatins).",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease associated with dilation and impaired function of the left or both ventricles. Familial forms of DCM are caused by mutations in genes encoding cytoskeletal, contractile, or regulatory proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. The most common form of DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is associated with mutations in the genes encoding the sarcomeric proteins beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-TM). In addition, mutations in the genes encoding the cytoskeletal protein desmin (DES) and the Z-disk protein Cypher (CSRP3) have been identified in rare families with autosomal dominant DCM. Mutations in the genes encoding the Z-disk protein Titin (TTN) and the sarcolemmal proteins dystrophin (DMD) and laminin (LAMA2) have been identified in families with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The Titin gene encodes a protein that spans the half-sarcomere from the Z disk to the M-band. Mutations in this gene are thought to cause DCM by altering the elasticity of the sarcomere and / or by disrupting signaling pathways that are important for cardiac development and / or homeostasis.",
  "The E2A-HLF fusion gene is generated by the t (1 7; 1 9) (q2 3; p1 3) chromosomal translocation in pre-B-cell ALL. The E2A gene on chromosome 1 9 is fused to the HLF gene on chromosome 1 7. The E2A-HLF chimeric protein consists of the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of E2A and the basic leucine zipper domain of HLF.

  "Inflammasomes are large protein complexes that assemble in response to cellular stress and damage and serve to activate inflammatory caspases and induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The best characterized inflammasome is the one formed by the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), also known as NALP3 or Pypa1R, and the adaptor protein ASC. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-1 8. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by a variety of stimuli, including bacterial and viral components, extracellular ATP, and the environmental irritants silica and asbestos. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires two signals. The first signal is provided by microbial components or stress signals that activate the transcription of the inflammasome components. The second signal is provided by a variety of agents that activate the inflammasome. The identification of the molecular mechanisms that regulate inflammasome activation will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",
  "The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) that lines the inner surface of the glomerular capillaries and is essential for the permselective properties of the kidney glomerular filter. The GBM is a highly specialized ECM that is composed primarily of type IV collagen, laminin, and proteoglycans. The size, charge, and shape of the proteins in the GBM are precisely regulated to maintain the size and shape of the glomerular filtration barrier, while allowing for the selective permeability of the filter. The size of the proteins in the GBM is regulated by the proteolytic degradation of large proteins by the serine protease plasmin, which is activated by the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1). The charge of the proteins in the GBM is regulated by the heparan sulfate (HS) side chains of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) agrin. The size and charge of the proteins in the GBM are also regulated by the post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues in the collagen chains. The collagen IV molecules in the GBM are heterotrimers, with each molecule consisting of two alpha 1 chains, two alpha 2 chains, and one alpha 3 chain. The alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains are encoded by the COL4A1 and COL4A2 genes, and the alpha 3 chain is encoded by the COL4A3 gene. Mutations in the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes cause Alport syndrome, a progressive kidney disease characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and eventual renal failure. Mutations in the COL4A5 gene cause thin basement membrane disease, a disorder characterized by persistent microscopic hematuria. Mutations in the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes cause autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive thin basement membrane disease. Mutations in the COL4A5 gene also cause the more severe disease Alport syndrome. Mutations in the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes cause Alport syndrome by a dominant negative effect, in which the mutant alpha 3 and alpha 4 chains are incorporated into the GBM, but do not participate in the formation of heterotrimers. The mutant alpha 3 and alpha 4 chains are incorporated into the GBM, and disrupt the normal structure and function of the GBM. The disruption of the GBM leads to the thickening and splitting of the basement membrane, the loss of the normal filtration properties of the GBM, and the development of proteinuria and renal failure.",
  "Fas-mediated apoptosis is triggered by the Fas ligand (FasL), a member of the TNF family of cytokines. Fas is a 4 0kDa type I transmembrane protein that is expressed on the cell surface. Binding of FasL to Fas triggers a signaling cascade that results in apoptosis. The signaling cascade begins with the aggregation of Fas by the binding of FasL, which leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein). FADD in turn recruits caspase-8 to the membrane through the death effector domains (DED) of each protein. Caspase-8 is then activated by self-cleavage and this active caspase-8 proteolytically activates downstream caspases, including caspase-3. The cleavage of caspase-3 leads to the degradation of cellular proteins and the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis. The cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 leads to the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.",
  "TNF is a cytokine that can induce a variety of cellular responses including inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. The TNF receptor family contains five members, TNFR1 through 5. TNFR1 and TNFR2 are expressed on most cells, and can induce both apoptotic and proliferative signals. The proliferative signal is activated by the TRAF family of proteins recruited to the TNF receptor complex by the death domain of the receptor. The apoptotic signal is activated by the recruitment of RIP and FAN to the receptor complex. Both of these pathways activate the transcription factor NF-kB, but the mechanism of activation is different. The proliferative signal is activated by the TRAF family of proteins recruiting the protein kinase NIK to the receptor complex. NIK activates the IkappaB kinase complex, which phosphorylates IkB, causing it to dissociate from NF-kB and move into the nucleus to activate transcription. The apoptotic signal is activated by the recruitment of RIP and FAN to the receptor complex. RIP activates the kinase RIP-associated ICH-1 to phosphorylate FADD and activate caspase-8. FAN activates caspase-1 through a still unknown mechanism. Caspase-1 activates caspase-3, which cleaves ICAD, releasing the CAD to enter the nucleus and activate the apoptotic program.",
  "The progression of melanoma is associated with the loss of the cell cycle checkpoint control and the activation of cellular proliferation. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a key event in the transformation of normal melanocytes to melanoma. The activation of the MAPK pathway is achieved by the mutation of the NRAS, BRAF, and HRAS genes. The NRAS mutation leads to the constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, which is not dependent on growth factor stimulation. The BRAF mutation is found in approximately half of all melanomas and is associated with the constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The HRAS mutation is found in a small subset of melanomas and is associated with the constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway in the absence of growth factor stimulation.",
  "Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of protein synthesis. Eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) is a key regulator of translation and is regulated by phosphorylation of its alpha subunit. One eIF-2 kinase activated by double-stranded RNA is the PKR protein kinase. PKR is also activated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress-activated kinase PERK. Activation of PKR and PERK leads to phosphorylation of eIF-2 and inhibition of translation. Another eIF-2 kinase activated by interferon is the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). PERK is activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER and phosphorylates the eIF-2 alpha subunit. The phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha by PKR, PERK and other eIF-2 kinases leads to inhibition of translation and a reduction in protein synthesis that can lead to the formation of stress granules. Stress granules are cytoplasmic aggregates of mRNA, translation initiation factors and other proteins that are induced by stress. The formation of stress granules may play a role in the translational control and the stress response.",
  "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that signals the status of energy stores to the brain and other tissues. Leptin acts on its receptor in the hypothalamus to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. Leptin receptors are also expressed in other tissues, including skeletal muscle, liver, and the heart. In skeletal muscle, leptin stimulates fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure. The mechanism by which leptin stimulates fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle is not known, but may involve inhibition of ACC. Leptin also stimulates glucose uptake and oxidation in skeletal muscle, and this may contribute to the ability of leptin to reduce body weight. Leptin does not appear to alter glucose homeostasis in humans, but may improve glucose tolerance in diabetic animal models. The ability of leptin to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure may be useful in the treatment of obesity and other conditions in which energy storage is increased, such as type II diabetes.",
  "GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABA is released from presynaptic terminals and binds to postsynaptic GABA-A receptors to produce an inhibitory response. GABA-A receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels that are inhibited by benzodiazepines. GABA-A receptors are heteropentamers, typically composed of two alpha, two beta, and two delta subunits. The alpha subunits determine the pharmacological properties of the receptor, and the delta subunit is required for the formation of receptors on the dendrites. The subcellular localization of GABA-A receptors is an important determinant of the response to GABA. Receptors on the cell surface are rapidly internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The receptors are then either rapidly recycled back to the cell surface or transported to the lysosome for degradation. Gephyrin is a brain specific protein that binds to the intracellular domain of the beta subunit of the GABA-A receptor. Gephyrin is required for the clustering of GABA-A receptors at synapses. The clustering of GABA-A receptors at synapses may also be regulated by phosphorylation of the receptor.",
  "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I, which is further cleaved by ACE to form the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Angiotensinogen is also cleaved by the serine protease cathepsin G to form angiotensin I, which is the same length as angiotensin I formed by ACE. Angiotensinogen is found in plasma and is filtered through the kidney glomerulus, where it is cleaved by cathepsin G in the tubular lumen. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that also has proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. ACE is found in the lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels. Angiotensinogen is also found in the lungs and is cleaved by renin in the circulation. Angiotensinogen is also found in the kidneys and is filtered through the kidney glomerulus, where it is cleaved by cathepsin G in the tubular lumen. Angiotensinogen is also found in the brain, where it is cleaved by cathepsin G in the cerebrospinal fluid. The ACE inhibitor captopril is used to treat hypertension and heart failure. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to form angiotensin II, which increases blood pressure by constricting blood vessels and increasing the cardiac output. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reducing blood pressure. The renin inhibitor aliskiren is also being developed as a treatment for hypertension. Angiotensinogen is also cleaved by the protease chymase, which is found in high concentrations in the heart and blood vessels. Chymase cleaves angiotensin I to form the peptide angiotensin II (4-8), which is a more potent vasoconstrictor than angiotensin II. The cleavage of angiotensin I by chymase also releases angiotensin II (1-7), which is a vasodilator. The inhibition of chymase may be a new way to treat heart disease.",
  "T cell activation is a complex process that requires the interaction of the T cell receptor with antigen-MHC complex on an antigen-presenting cell. The T cell receptor complex is associated with the CD3 complex, which is responsible for the signal-transducing function of the receptor. The activation of T cells requires two signals, one provided by the T cell receptor and the other provided by the interaction of the costimulatory molecule CD2 8 with B7 on the antigen-presenting cell. The interaction of the T cell receptor with antigen-MHC complex induces a series of signaling events, including the activation of protein tyrosine kinases of the src and Syk families, the activation of phospholipase C, and the production of second messengers such as IP3 and diacylglycerol. The activation of protein tyrosine kinases leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates, including the adaptor protein LAT. LAT phosphorylation creates binding sites for the recruitment of other signaling molecules, including phospholipase C-gamma1, which is required for the production of the second messengers. The activation of protein kinase C and the production of IP3 and diacylglycerol lead to the activation of the transcription factors NF-AT and NF-kB, which are required for the activation of T cells. The interaction of the costimulatory molecule CD2 8 with its ligands on the antigen-presenting cell further enhances T cell activation. The activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway by the costimulatory molecule provides an additional source of metabolic energy that is required for T cell activation.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins are secreted factors that bind to cell surface receptors of the Frizzled family. Wnt signaling is involved in many developmental processes and is also involved in the development of cancer. Wnt signaling is involved in the development of cancer in a variety of tissues. Wnt signaling can lead to either activation or repression of transcription. In the absence of Wnt signaling, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and is targeted for proteosomal degradation. Binding of Wnt to Frizzled leads to inhibition of GSK-3 and the accumulation of beta-catenin. Beta-catenin is then free to move into the nucleus and activate transcription. Wnt signaling can also lead to activation of the Map kinase pathway and the transcription factor NF-kB. Wnt signaling can also lead to the activation of the PI3 kinase pathway. Wnt signaling can also lead to the activation of the transcription factor NFAT. Wnt signaling can also lead to the activation of the transcription factor NFAT. Wnt signaling can also lead to the activation of the transcription factor DREAM.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that signals through a receptor complex that includes the beta-subunit of the IL-6 receptor and gp1 3 0. The gp1 3 0 receptor is a shared receptor with the receptor for IL-11and the LIF receptor. The JAK kinases are associated with the cytoplasmic domain of gp1 3 0 and are activated by ligand binding to gp1 3 0. The JAKs phosphorylate the receptor on tyrosine, creating binding sites for src homology 2 (SH2) containing proteins like STAT transcription factors. STAT factors are phosphorylated by JAK and dimerize in the nucleus to activate transcription. The ras / raf / MEK / MAP kinase pathway is also activated by IL-6 and leads to activation of transcription factors like AP-1. The JAK / STAT and ras / raf / MEK / MAP kinase pathways are activated by IL-6 in a coordinated fashion to activate transcription of genes like C-reactive protein.",
  "The NFAT family of transcription factors plays a key role in the regulation of genes involved in the immune response. The NFAT proteins are regulated by a calcium-dependent signaling pathway that is activated by the antigen receptor on T cells and by other cell surface receptors. The NFAT proteins are retained in the cytoplasm of resting cells by interacting with the chaperone protein 1-4-3. Activation of the calcium signaling pathway leads to the activation of the phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates the NFAT proteins, causing them to migrate from 1-4-3 to the nucleus. In addition to regulating the subcellular localization of the NFAT proteins, calcium signaling also regulates the transcriptional activity of the NFAT proteins. The transcriptional activity of NFAT proteins is regulated by a variety of kinases, including the protein kinase C family members, the CaM kinase family members, and the casein kinase I family members. The activity of the NFAT proteins is also regulated by the binding of other transcription factors. The NFAT proteins interact with other transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-AT family members to regulate genes involved in cytokine gene expression and the immune response.",
  "The cell cycle is driven by the coordinated activity of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cyclin regulatory subunits. The activity of CDKs is regulated by the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the catalytic domain and by the association of CDK inhibitors. The transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle is regulated by the activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 / 6 complex, which phosphorylates the Rb protein and related proteins, releasing the inhibition of E2F transcription factors. The activation of E2F transcription factors induces the expression of cyclin E, which forms a complex with CDK2 and phosphorylates Rb and related proteins, further releasing E2F. The activity of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex is also regulated by the CDK inhibitor p2 7Kip1. The ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway plays an important role in regulating cell cycle progression. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins targets them for rapid degradation by the proteosome. The addition of ubiquitin is catalyzed by a multi-subunit enzyme known as the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), which activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction. Ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and is then transferred to a substrate protein, usually with the participation of a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). The transfer of ubiquitin to a protein is a three-step reaction. E1 first forms a high energy thioester bond with ubiquitin. E2 then interacts with E3, bringing it into close proximity with the substrate protein, and transfers ubiquitin to the substrate protein. Proteins that are tagged with ubiquitin are recognized by a multi-subunit protein complex known as the proteosome, and are degraded rapidly. The activity of the proteosome is itself regulated by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. The addition of NEDD8 to a protein is analogous to the addition of ubiquitin, but the enzymes that catalyze the addition of NEDD8 and the substrates modified by NEDD8 are different from those involved in the addition of ubiquitin. NEDD8 is added to the cullin subunits of the SCF complex, a ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates cell cycle progression. The addition of NEDD8 to cullin increases the activity of the SCF complex, and may also increase the ability of the complex to recognize specific substrates.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are expressed by innate immune cells and recognize conserved microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of PRRs that recognize bacterial cell wall components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoproteins. Upon recognition of PAMPs, TLRs activate signaling pathways that culminate in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The adaptor protein MyD8 8 is required for signaling by all TLRs with the exception of TLR3. TRIF is required for signaling by TLR3 and TLR4. TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) is required for signaling by TLR4, but not for signaling by TLR2 or TLR3. TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TIRAP) is required for signaling by TLR2 and TLR4, but not for signaling by TLR3. TRAF3 is required for signaling by all TLRs with the exception of TLR3. TRAF6 is required for signaling by all TLRs with the exception of TLR3. TRAF3 and TRAF6 activate the kinase map kinase (MKK) and the transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1. The production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines is essential for the clearance of bacterial infection. Chronic activation of innate immune signaling can, however, result in tissue damage and inflammatory disease.",
  "The chemokine receptor CCR5 and CCR2 are expressed on macrophages and T cells and act as coreceptors for macrophage-tropic HIV strains. The ligands for these receptors are the beta-chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alphaand MIP-1beta. beta-chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that direct the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. The CCR5 and CCR2 genes are genetically associated with the rate of disease progression in HIV-infected individuals. The CCR5Delta3 2 mutation that results in a truncated, non-functional receptor is found in approximately 3% of Caucasians. Individuals homozygous for the CCR5Delta3 2 mutation are highly resistant to HIV infection. The CCR2-64I mutation that results in a non-conservative amino acid change in the CCR2 receptor is also associated with delayed progression to AIDS. The CCR5Delta3 2 and CCR2-64I mutations are in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. The protective effect of these mutations is due to the absence of the CCR5 and CCR2 receptors on the surfaces of cells expressing these mutant genes. The CCR5Delta3 2 mutation is found in approximately 1% of Caucasians and is found at a higher frequency in individuals of European and American descent. The CCR2-64I mutation is found at a higher frequency in individuals of Asian descent.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The binding of EGF or other ligands to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase leads to the recruitment of signaling molecules to the receptor and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The Ras-Map kinase pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway are two major signaling pathways that are activated by the EGFR. Ras activates the Raf-1 kinase, which in turn activates the MAP kinase cascade. The activated Map kinases phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as ELK-1 and SRF. The PI-3K pathway leads to the activation of AKT and other kinases. The Crk adaptor proteins are substrates of the EGFR and may link the EGFR to other signaling pathways.",
  "Fc epsilon RI is a multi-subunit receptor that plays a key role in allergic responses. The crosslinking of Fc epsilon RI by antigen-antibody complexes on the surface of mast cells leads to the release of inflammatory mediators. This process is known as mast cell activation. The activation of mast cells is also important in host defense mechanisms such as the response to parasites. The activation of mast cells is initiated by the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways. The activation of mast cells is also affected by other signaling pathways. In this chapter we will discuss the role of signaling pathways in mast cell activation. We will first discuss the activation of Fc epsilon RI and the role of this receptor in mast cell activation. We will then discuss the role of signaling pathways downstream of Fc epsilon RI in mast cell activation. We will discuss the role of calcium in mast cell activation and the role of calcium in signaling pathways. We will also discuss the role of the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk in mast cell activation. We will discuss the role of the MAP kinase pathway in mast cell activation and the role of the transcription factor AP-1 in mast cell activation. We will also discuss the role of the lipid second messenger IP3 in mast cell activation and the role of the lipid kinase PI3 kinase in mast cell activation.",
  "TNF is a cytokine that induces apoptosis in some cells and is involved in inflammatory signaling. TNF binds to two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which are members of the TNF receptor gene family. Binding of TNF to TNFR1 activates two signaling pathways, one that leads to apoptosis and one that activates transcription factors that induce inflammatory signaling. The apoptotic pathway is activated by TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and receptor interacting protein (RIP). TRADD and RIP recruit the protein kinases RIP and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF-2). RIP and TRAF-2 activate the caspase 8 pathway that leads to apoptosis. Activation of NF-kB by TNF is blocked by the I-kappa kinase complex, which contains the kinases RIP, TRAF-2, and the I-kappa kinase subunit I-kappa kinase-associated protein (IKAP). The I-kappa kinase phosphorylates I-kappa B, causing I-kappa B to dissociate from NF-kB and allow NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription. The TRAF-2 component of the I-kappa kinase also activates Map kinases that activate transcription factors such as c-Jun.",
  "The peptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) is a key regulator of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Ang II is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor angiotensinogen by the protease renin. Ang II exerts its actions through two different G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2. The AT1 receptor couples to Gq / 1 1 to activate phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to produce inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. IP3 causes release of intracellular calcium, and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (PKC). PKC activation and calcium influx stimulate the activity of the Na + / H + exchanger, leading to an increase in intracellular sodium and a subsequent increase in blood pressure. DAG activates the Ras / Raf-1 / MEK / ERK pathway, leading to activation of the transcription factor AP-1 and subsequent regulation of gene expression. The AT2 receptor is coupled to the G protein Gi, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and leads to a decrease in cAMP. The activation of the AT2 receptor also leads to activation of the Src family of tyrosine kinases and subsequent activation of the Ras / Raf-1 / MEK / ERK pathway.",
  "Sprouty proteins are a family of proteins that act as inhibitors of signaling by growth factor receptors. Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling by growth factor receptors such as the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. Sprouty proteins inhibit signaling by blocking the activation of the Ras / MAP kinase pathway by growth factor receptors. Sprouty proteins do not inhibit the binding of growth factor to its receptor, but inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein GRB2 and the subsequent activation of Ras by the Grb2 / Sos-1 complex. Sprouty proteins interact with the GRB2-associated binding protein (Gab1) and inhibit the association of Gab1 with the tyrosine kinase MET. Sprouty proteins also interact with Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with the tyrosine kinase receptors to target them for degradation. Sprouty proteins interact with Cbl through a tyrosine-phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the amino terminus of Sprouty. Interaction of Sprouty with Cbl increases the stability of Cbl and increases its ability to ubiquitinate and down-regulate the growth factor receptors. Sprouty proteins also interact with the protein kinase Raf-1 and inhibit the activation of Raf-1. The interaction of Sprouty with Raf-1 appears to be indirect and may involve an adaptor protein. Sprouty proteins also interact with the lipid kinase PI3 kinase and inhibit the activation of PI3 kinase by growth factor receptors. The interaction of Sprouty with PI3 kinase may be important in the inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway by Sprouty.",
  "Vasoconstrictor agents acting on GPCRs in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) cause the release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores and entry of Ca2 + from the extracellular space. The increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration ([Ca2 +] i) is a major signal for activation of contractile proteins, leading to contraction. The initial Ca2 + release is due to the activation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) by the second messenger IP3. The subsequent Ca2 + entry is mediated by voltage-operated Ca2 + channels (VOCs) and receptor-operated Ca2 + channels (ROCs). The VOCs are activated by membrane depolarization, which is caused by inhibition of the large conductance Ca2 + -activated K + channels (BK channels) and / or activation of non-selective cation channels (NSCCs). The NSCCs are activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2 + stores and / or by a direct interaction of the Ca2 + -sensing receptor (CaR) with the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The CaR is also involved in the activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and subsequent production of arachidonic acid (AA), which is metabolized to the vasoconstrictor eicosanoids. The RhoA / Rho kinase pathway is involved in the regulation of the Ca2 + sensitivity of contractile proteins. The Ca2 + sensitivity is determined by the ratio of GTP-bound active form of RhoA to GDP-bound inactive form of RhoA. The Ca2 + sensitivity is increased by the activation of the RhoA / Rho kinase pathway, which phosphorylates myosin phosphatase (MLCP) and its regulatory subunit myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (MLCK). The Ca2 + sensitization induced by the RhoA / Rho kinase pathway is inhibited by the cAMP / protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. The cAMP / PKA pathway inhibits the Ca2 + sensitization by phosphorylating the InsP3R and / or the RhoA / Rho kinase pathway.",
  "The G2 / M DNA damage checkpoint prevents cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis. This checkpoint is activated by DNA damage and results in inhibition of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex, which is required for entry into mitosis. The protein kinase Chk1 is activated by the DNA damage checkpoint and phosphorylates and inhibits the Cdc2 5C phosphatase, which dephosphorylates and activates Cdc2. The protein kinase Chk2 is also activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates Cdc2 5C, but it is not required for the DNA damage checkpoint. Instead, Chk2 activates the transcriptional program of genes that includes the cell cycle inhibitor p53, which in turn inhibits the Cdc2-cyclin B complex. The DNA damage checkpoint also inhibits the degradation of p53, which is required for the activation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex. The DNA damage checkpoint also inhibits the transcription of genes that promote the progression of mitosis. The p53 gene product inhibits the transcription of these genes by preventing the activation of the transcription factor E2F. The DNA damage checkpoint also inhibits the transcription of the Cdc2 gene itself, which is required for the activation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex.",
  "Thrombin is a serine protease that plays a key role in blood coagulation. It cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin, which is then degraded to release platelets. Thrombin also has a number of other effects in cells, including activation of platelets, proliferation of cells, and regulation of gene expression. The effects of thrombin are mediated by protease-activated receptors (PARs). Four PARs have been identified, PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4. Each of these PARs has an extracellular N-terminus that is cleaved by thrombin to reveal a new N-terminus that acts as a ligand for a second receptor. PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved by thrombin, but PAR3 is not. The tethered ligand sequence for PAR1 is SFLLRN, and the tethered ligand sequence for PAR4 is GYPGQV. Synthetic peptides with these sequences activate the receptors and can also be used to study the actions of the tethered ligands in the intact protein. PAR1 and PAR4 are cleaved and activated at similar rates by thrombin, but PAR4 has a higher affinity for the tethered ligand than does PAR1. The tethered ligand for PAR2 is SLIGRL, and cleavage of PAR3 does not activate G proteins. The tethered ligands for PAR1 and PAR4 are stable for many hours in the absence of protease inhibitors, but the peptide ligands are rapidly cleaved and inactivated by the protease inhibitor antithrombin III and alpha-macroglobulin. The continued presence of the tethered ligands can activate PAR signaling, so that the proteases can act in an autocrine or paracrine manner. The tethered ligands for PAR1 and PAR4 activate G protein-coupled signaling pathways, but PAR4 also signals through a G-protein-independent pathway involving beta-arrestin and the tyrosine kinase Pyk2. The G protein-independent pathway requires tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-arrestin by the Src kinase, recruitment of Pyk2, and activation of the small G protein Rac1. Rac1 activation leads to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of lamellipodia, which are involved in cell motility and migration. The G protein-dependent pathway leads to activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms alpha, beta, and gamma, which are involved in platelet activation and proliferation of cells. The role of PAR4 in platelet activation is not clear, but it is thought to play a role in the initial activation of platelets by low concentrations of thrombin.",
  "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a key regulator of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Ang II exerts its effects through two receptors, AT1 and AT2. The AT1 receptor is coupled to Gq / 1 1 proteins and activation of phospholipase C, inositol phosphate formation and intracellular calcium release. Ang II also activates the MAP kinase pathway through Gi / o proteins and ras. Ang II also activates the tyrosine kinase pathway through the AT1 receptor. The tyrosine kinase pathway leads to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the stimulation of immediate early genes such as c-fos. The activation of these genes leads to long term effects such as cell proliferation and differentiation. The AT1 receptor also couples to Gi / o proteins and activates the MAP kinase pathway through this pathway. This pathway is independent of Gi / o proteins and is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. The activation of the tyrosine kinase pathway by Ang II is mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ang II also activates the c-fos gene through the AT1 receptor through a pathway involving protein kinase C and the EGF receptor. The activation of the c-fos gene by Ang II through this pathway leads to the formation of AP-1 transcription factor complexes and the stimulation of genes containing AP-1 binding sites. The activation of AP-1 by Ang II through this pathway may play a role in the long term effects of Ang II such as cell proliferation and differentiation.",
  "TGF-beta signaling is involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. TGF-beta signaling is initiated by ligand binding to TGF-beta receptors, which in turn phosphorylate the receptor-activated SMAD (R-SMAD) proteins, SMAD2 and SMAD3. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated by the TGF-beta type I receptor ALK5, while SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 are phosphorylated by the TGF-beta type II receptor. The phosphorylated SMADs form a complex with the co-SMAD, SMAD4, and this complex then translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription. SMAD-independent signaling by TGF-beta also occurs, including activation of the MAPK pathways.",
  "Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that bind to cell surface receptors of the Frizzled family. Wnt signaling is involved in a variety of developmental processes including axis formation, cell fate specification, and tissue patterning. Wnt signaling is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Wnt signaling is activated by binding of Wnt to Frizzled, which leads to the stabilization of beta-catenin. In the absence of Wnt signaling, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and is targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Binding of Wnt to Frizzled leads to inhibition of GSK-3, resulting in stabilization of beta-catenin. Beta-catenin is then able to complex with members of the LEF / TCF family of transcription factors and activate transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Wnt signaling is inhibited by members of the Dkk family of secreted proteins. Wnt signaling is also inhibited by members of the Fz family of receptors. Wnt signaling is also inhibited by the APC tumor suppressor protein. Mutations in APC lead to constitutive activation of beta-catenin and constitutive activation of Wnt-regulated genes. Mutations in beta-catenin that prevent its phosphorylation and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway also lead to constitutive activation of Wnt-regulated genes. Wnt signaling leads to the stabilization of beta-catenin, which is able to complex with LEF / TCF transcription factors and activate transcription of Wnt-regulated genes. Wnt signaling is also regulated by the TCF family member LEF1. LEF1 is expressed in the developing central nervous system, but is not expressed in the developing intestine. Wnt signaling in the developing intestine leads to the activation of cdx-2 and msx-4, which activate expression of the homeobox gene PDX-1. PDX-1 is a transcription factor that is required for expression of insulin and other pancreatic hormones.",
  "Homologous recombination (HR) is a mechanism for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). HR requires the generation of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule at the site of the DSB, followed by the search for a homologous DNA sequence and the formation of a joint molecule (Holliday junction), which is resolved either by a synthesis-dependent strand-annealing mechanism or by a Holliday junction-specific branch migration mechanism. The strand exchange protein Rad5 1 plays a central role in HR by catalyzing the formation of a nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA that searches for and invades a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequence, forming a stable synaptic complex that can then be extended by DNA synthesis. The strand exchange protein Rad5 4 and the Swi2 / Snf2-like ATPase Rad5 4B stimulate the activity of Rad5 1 in vitro. The Holliday junction is then resolved by structure-specific endonucleases or by branch migration of the junction, followed by either of the two resolution mechanisms.",
  "The formation of metastases by cancer cells is a multi-step process involving local invasion, intravasation, transport through the vasculature, extravasation, and growth at a distant site. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in the process of metastasis. During EMT, epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-cell adhesions, and gain a mesenchymal phenotype. The transcription factors Snail, Slug, and Twist are key regulators of EMT. They repress the expression of E-cadherin, a key cell adhesion molecule, and other epithelial genes, and induce the expression of mesenchymal genes. The induction of EMT by these transcription factors is associated with increased motility and invasiveness. The expression of Snail and Twist is regulated by the extracellular signals TGF-beta and EGF, and by the intracellular signaling pathways PI3K / Akt, MAPK, and GSK-3. The induction of EMT by these transcription factors is associated with the development of cancer stem cells. The induction of EMT by these transcription factors is also associated with the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation. The induction of EMT by these transcription factors also contributes to the development of therapeutic resistance. The induction of EMT by these transcription factors also contributes to the development of cancer stem cells.

  "Cutaneous melanoma is a highly aggressive malignancy that arises from the transformation of normal melanocytes. The incidence of melanoma has increased dramatically in the past several decades, with a corresponding increase in mortality. The risk of developing melanoma is increased by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and the prognosis is poor once metastases have occurred. The pathogenesis of melanoma is complex and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The identification of genes that are involved in the development of melanoma has provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of melanoma. The CDKN2A gene encodes two distinct tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4A and p19ARF, that are involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, respectively. Germline mutations in CDKN2A are found in a high percentage of families with a high incidence of melanoma. The CDK4 gene encodes a protein that binds to and inhibits the function of p16INK4A. The activating mutations in the NRAS and BRAF genes are found in a high percentage of melanomas. The MITF gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and differentiation of melanocytes. The identification of the genes involved in the development of melanoma has provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of melanoma.

  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms originating from the renal epithelium. The two most common histologic subtypes of RCC are conventional (clear cell) RCC (CCRCC) and papillary RCC (pRCC). Approximately 5% of RCC are chromophobe RCC, and collecting duct carcinoma is rare. Approximately 1 0% of RCC are unclassified. The molecular pathogenesis of RCC is complex and heterogeneous. The VHL tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in the majority of patients with CCRCC. Hereditary papillary RCC (HPRC) is associated with germline mutations of the MET oncogene. Loss of the p163 VHL gene product leads to accumulation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which activate genes involved in angiogenesis and glycolysis. Activating mutations of the MET oncogene lead to constitutive activation of the HGF / SF receptor tyrosine kinase and the downstream signaling pathways. Activation of the MET oncogene also leads to loss of p163 VHL, resulting in increased HIF levels. The VHL and MET pathways converge on the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CCRCC and HPRC. The molecular pathogenesis of pRCC is less well characterized. Activating mutations of the beta-catenin gene have been identified in a small subset of patients with pRCC. Loss of p163 VHL may also contribute to the pathogenesis of pRCC.",
  "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal cascade that plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Angiotensis II (Ang II) is the final product of this system and is a potent vasoconstrictor. It is also a growth factor and a mitogen. The RAS is comprised of two major components, renin, the enzyme that cleaves prorenin to form Ang I, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that cleaves Ang I to form the active peptide Ang II. ACE is also known as kininase II and cleaves bradykinin, a vasodilator peptide, to inactive peptide bradykinin. ACE is a zinc metallopeptidase that cleaves a dipeptide from the N-terminus of several peptides, including Ang I and bradykinin. The RAS is a classic endocrine system, with the plasma RAS acting as a circulating hormone. However, the components of the RAS are also found in many tissues, where they act as local hormones. Ang II is also formed from the nonapeptide angiotensin I (AngI) by the action of thelarge protease cathepsin D. AngI is formed in tissues by the action of tissue-specific aspartyl proteases, thelarge proteases. The formation of Ang II in tissues is regulated by the balance between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which converts AngI to Ang II, and the thelarge protease cathepsin D, which degrades AngI to form the ACE-resistant heptapeptide angiotensin (1-7) (Ang- (1-7)). Ang- (1-7) is a biologically active peptide that is formed from AngI by the action of ACE-independent pathway. The actions of Ang II are mediated by two types of receptors, AT1 and AT2. AT1 receptors are coupled to Gq / 1 1 proteins and activate phospholipase C, resulting in the release of intracellular calcium and the activation of protein kinase C. The AT2 receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is coupled to Gi / o proteins. The AT2 receptor is widely expressed in the developing heart and vasculature, and its expression is upregulated in pathological conditions such as heart failure and atherosclerosis. Ang II also stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through the activation of NADPH oxidase. Ang II also stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the subsequent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy is mediated by the AT1 receptor and involves the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Ang II also stimulates the expression of c-fos and egr-1, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression. Ang II also stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and the subsequent activation of the MAPK pathway. The activation of the EGF receptor and the subsequent stimulation of the MAPK pathway by Ang II may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a complex of polypeptides that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for recognizing foreign antigens presented by MHC-1 molecules on the surface of other cells. The TCR is composed of two subunits, the clonotypic alpha beta heterodimer and the invariant CD3 polypeptides gamma delta epsilon zeta that noncovalently associate to form the TCR / CD3 complex. The CD3 polypeptides are transmembrane proteins that associate with the TCR complex in the membrane and are responsible for the signal transduction events that result in T cell activation. The clonotypic alpha beta heterodimer is responsible for recognizing specific antigens and is expressed on the surface of T cells only when associated with the CD3 polypeptides. The CD3 polypeptides do not have intrinsic enzymatic activity but associate with protein kinases that are involved in the transduction of the antigen-induced T cell activation signal. The activation of T cells by antigen is dependent on the interaction of the clonotypic alpha beta heterodimer with MHC-1 molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The interaction of the TCR with MHC-1 and the interaction of the TCR with antigen results in the aggregation of the TCR and the recruitment of the CD3 polypeptides to the TCR complex. The aggregation of the TCR and the recruitment of the CD3 polypeptides leads to the activation of the protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn and the subsequent phosphorylation of the CD3 polypeptides and the TCR. The activation of Lck and Fyn leads to the phosphorylation of other proteins involved in T cell activation, including the tyrosine kinase ZAP-7 0. The phosphorylation of the TCR and the CD3 polypeptides creates binding sites for other signaling molecules and leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways that result in T cell activation.",
  "Mast cells are specialized cells of hematopoietic origin that play a key role in the immune response by releasing a variety of preformed and newly synthesized lipid-derived mediators, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, and cytokines, such as histamine and TNF-alpha, upon activation. The activation of mast cells by allergens, such as pollen, or by specific antigens (allergens) is responsible for the development of allergic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis, and food allergy. The activation of mast cells by cross-linking of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) by allergens leads to the release of preformed mediators by degranulation. The de novo synthesis of lipid mediators is triggered by the activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the subsequent release of membrane phospholipids, which are mainly phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM). The activation of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the subsequent activation of the serine-threonine kinase AKT (also known as protein kinase B) are also involved in this process. The activation of PLA2 liberates arachidonic acid (AA), the first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of eicosanoids. The subsequent metabolism of AA by the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway leads to the synthesis of the leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), which are potent inflammatory mediators. The metabolism of AA by the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway leads to the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2, and PGI2), which are involved in many physiological processes, including the regulation of the cardiovascular system and the immune response.",
  "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and predisposition to cancer. Cells from FA patients are highly sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) and exhibit chromosomal instability. At the cellular level, FA cells are characterized by a defect in the G2 / M cell cycle checkpoint and a high frequency of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations. FA is genetically heterogeneous and at least eight complementation groups have been identified (A through H). The genes for the complementation groups A, C, E, F, G, and L have been cloned and characterized. These genes encode proteins that are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. In response to DNA damage, the FA proteins FANC-A, -C, -E, and -G form a nuclear complex that activates the downstream FA protein, FANCD2. The activation of FANCD2 requires the FA proteins A, C, E, F, and G, and is regulated by the ATM checkpoint kinase. The downstream targets of the FA pathway include BRCA1, BRCA2, and the RAD5 1 protein. The role of the FA proteins in DNA repair is not yet clear, but it is likely that the FA proteins are involved in the repair of DNA crosslinks.",
  "Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific protein, which is exclusively present in the plasma as oligomers (trimers, hexamers, and HMW forms). Plasma levels of adiponectin are inversely correlated with obesity and insulin resistance. Adiponectin exerts its insulin-sensitizing and anti-atherosclerotic actions through its receptors in muscle and liver. The adiponectin receptors are structurally distinct from those of other cytokines. The globular form of adiponectin is able to activate the AMPK pathway in muscle cells. The activation of AMPK by adiponectin leads to an increase in fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake. The hexameric and HMW forms of adiponectin bind to the cell-surface receptors, activating the AMPK pathway in muscle cells. The trimeric form of adiponectin binds to the receptor, activating the tyrosine kinase-based insulin signaling pathway in muscle cells. The hexameric and HMW forms of adiponectin also activate the AMPK pathway in liver cells. The activation of AMPK by adiponectin leads to an increase in fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins are secreted glycoproteins that regulate development and cell fate. Wnt signaling is involved in a variety of cellular processes including cell fate, cell adhesion, cell motility, and cell proliferation. The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins binds to cell surface receptors Frizzled and LRP5 / 6. Wnt binding to Frizzled leads to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), which phosphorylates beta-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Wnt binding to Frizzled also activates the phosphoprotein Disheveled, which inhibits the APC tumor suppressor protein. APC acts as a scaffold protein to recruit beta-catenin to the axin complex, where beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Phosphorylation of beta-catenin targets it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3 by Wnt signaling leads to the accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm, where it can move to the nucleus and interact with members of the TCF / LEF family of transcription factors to activate transcription of Wnt responsive genes. Wnt signaling also regulates the subcellular localization of beta-catenin. Wnt signaling causes the accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm, but prevents its translocation to the nucleus. Wnt signaling also regulates the subcellular localization of GSK-3. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3 in the cytoplasm, but activates GSK-3 in the nucleus. Wnt signaling also regulates the subcellular localization of beta-catenin. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3 in the cytoplasm, but activates GSK-3 in the nucleus. Wnt signaling causes the accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm, but prevents its translocation to the nucleus. Wnt signaling also regulates the subcellular localization of APC. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3 in the cytoplasm, but activates GSK-3 in the nucleus. Wnt signaling also regulates the subcellular localization of APC. Wnt signaling causes the accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm, but prevents its translocation to the nucleus. APC is required for the cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin, and APC is required for the nuclear localization of beta-catenin.",
  "The interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium is a key step in the inflammatory response. The adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium is mediated by a family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The endothelial cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 bind to leukocyte integrins LFA-1, Mac-1 and VLA-4. The interaction of PECAM-1 with the integrin VE-cadherin mediates the formation of endothelial cell junctions and also acts as an adhesion molecule for leukocytes. The interaction of P-Selectin with P-Selectin Glycoprotein on the leukocyte surface mediates the initial adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. The rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium is mediated by the interaction of P- Selectin with its ligand PSGL-1. The rolling leukocytes are then activated by chemokines expressed by the endothelium to adhere firmly and migrate into the tissue.",
  "Cutaneous melanoma is a significant health problem in the United States. The incidence of melanoma has been steadily increasing over the past several decades. The mortality rate from melanoma is high, with approximately 50% of patients dying from their disease. The incidence of melanoma is increasing at a faster rate than that of any other cancer. The identification of high-risk populations and early detection of melanoma are critical to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. The incidence of melanoma is strongly associated with the number of acquired melanocytic nevi (AMN). Persons with more than 1 AMN are at increased risk for melanoma. The identification of individuals with a high risk of developing melanoma, such as those with a family history of melanoma or multiple atypical nevi, can be used to target prevention efforts. The identification of genes involved in melanoma susceptibility has provided important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. The CDKN2A gene encodes 2 tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4A and p14ARF, that regulate the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways, respectively. Germline mutations in CDKN2A are found in approximately 20% of melanoma-prone families. The role of CDKN2A in sporadic melanoma is less clear. The role of CDK4 in melanoma is supported by the discovery of activating mutations in this gene in melanoma. The MC1R gene encodes a G-protein coupled receptor that regulates the production of melanin in melanocytes. MC1R variants are associated with red hair, pale skin, and blue eyes and are associated with increased melanoma risk. MC1R variants may also alter the response of melanocytes to ultraviolet radiation. The identification of high-risk individuals and the development of effective prevention strategies will help to reduce the incidence of melanoma.",
  "The G2 / M DNA damage checkpoint prevents the cell from entering mitosis if the genome is damaged. The checkpoint kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates the checkpoint kinase Chk2. Phosphorylated Chk2 in turn phosphorylates Cdc2 5C, which then dephosphorylates and activates the cyclin dependent kinase Cdk1 / Cdc2. The activation of Cdk1 / Cdc2 causes the cell to arrest in G2 and to prepare for repair of the damaged DNA. The phosphatase Cdc2 5C is a key regulator of the G2 / M checkpoint. When phosphorylated by checkpoint kinases, Cdc2 5C is sequestered in the cytoplasm by 1 4-3-3 proteins, and is thus unable to activate Cdk1 / Cdc2. The activity of the ubiquitin ligase APC / C is required for the transition from G2 into mitosis. The APC / C is active from G2 until the completion of DNA repair, when it is inhibited by the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Cds1. The APC / C inhibitor Emi2 is a target of the checkpoint kinases and is degraded in an APC / C-dependent manner. Emi2 prevents the activation of Cdk1 / Cdc2 until the damage is repaired.",
  "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel that is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR is expressed in the apical membrane of secretory epithelia, including the airways, intestine, and exocrine glands. The most common mutation in CFTR is a deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 5 0 8 (deltaF5 0 8). This mutation results in a protein that is improperly processed and rapidly degraded. The loss of CFTR function in secretory epithelia leads to the symptoms of CF. The second most common mutation is a single amino acid change, G5 1 2X, that results in a truncated protein that is not transported to the cell surface. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) stimulate the activity of wild-type CFTR. The G5 5 1D- and deltaF5 0 8-CFTR are also activated by PKA and PKC, but are less responsive than wild-type CFTR. The G5 5 1D-CFTR is not activated by PKA. The G5 5 1D- and deltaF5 0 8-CFTR are also less responsive to ATP than wild-type CFTR. The NHERF family of PDZ scaffold proteins (Na + / H + exchanger regulatory factor 1, NHERF-1; E3KARP; ERM-binding phosphoprotein 5 0, EBP5 0) interact with the C-terminus of CFTR. The interaction of CFTR with NHERF-1 may be involved in the regulation of CFTR channel activity and the endocytosis of CFTR. The disruption of the interaction of CFTR with NHERF-1 may provide a therapeutic strategy for CF.",
  "The cell cycle is a sequence of events that occur in a sequence of discrete regulatory phases known as the G1, S, G2 and M phases. The G1 phase is the resting phase and precedes the S, G2 and M phases. The G1 phase is the period of preparation for the cell to enter the rest of the cell cycle. The restriction point, or R point, is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. The restriction point determines the restriction of the cell to enter S phase. The restriction point is located at the boundary between the G1 and S phases. The initiation of DNA synthesis is the critical event that marks the completion of the G1 phase. The restriction point is regulated by the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and its family members, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDKs are a family of serine / threonine protein kinases that are activated by binding to regulatory subunits, cyclins. The activity of CDKs is negatively regulated by CDK inhibitors (CKIs). The CKIs are a group of proteins that inhibit the activity of CDKs. The activity of the CDKs is positively regulated by the cyclins and the transcription factor E2F. The activity of the CKIs is negatively regulated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteosome pathway. The ubiquitin-mediated proteosome pathway targets proteins for degradation by the proteosome. The destruction of the CKIs by the proteosome releases the inhibition of the CDKs. The E2F-Rb pathway is a key regulatory pathway that controls the progression of cells through the cell cycle. The Rb protein is a tumor suppressor that regulates the cell cycle by blocking the activity of the E2F transcription factor. The phosphorylation of Rb by the CDKs dissociates Rb from E2F, allowing it to activate genes required for DNA replication. The activity of the CDKs is also regulated by the CKIs. The activity of the CDKs is positively regulated by the cyclins and negatively regulated by the CKIs.",
  "The cell cycle is regulated by a series of cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) that are activated by binding to cyclins. The Cdks phosphorylate key substrates to regulate the cell cycle. The Cdks include Cdk2 / cyclin E and Cdk2 / cyclin A in the G1 to S phase transition, and Cdk2 / cyclin A in S phase and G2. The E2F family of transcription factors regulates genes involved in DNA replication and S phase progression. The Rb protein binds to E2F and represses transcription. Phosphorylation of Rb by the Cdks causes the release of E2F, and activation of E2F-regulated genes. The S phase cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin E, are required for S phase entry, and are required to maintain S phase. The ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the Cdks and the Rb protein for degradation is the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC / C). The APC / C is active from mitosis through G1, targeting proteins such as the cyclins for degradation by the ubiquitin pathway. The APC / C is inhibited by the early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) until the metaphase to anaphase transition. The APC / C also targets the S and M phase cyclins for degradation, preventing their accumulation until the following G1 phase. The APC / C is inhibited by the early mitotic checkpoint protein (Emi2) until the completion of mitosis.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is a multisubunit complex that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is involved in the recognition of foreign antigen bound to MHC-1 molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The TCR complex is composed of three polypeptide chains, alpha, beta, and gamma. The TCR alpha and beta chains each contain an extracellular domain that binds antigen-bound MHC-1, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that contains a tyrosine kinase activation motif (ITAM). The gamma chain is a component of the TCR in some T cell subsets, but is not required for TCR expression or function. The CD3 subunits are also components of the TCR complex and each contains a cytoplasmic domain with ITAMs that are phosphorylated and activated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn upon TCR ligation. The activation of Lck and Fyn by the TCR complex is thought to be the primary mechanism by which the ITAMs are phosphorylated. The activation of Lck and Fyn is believed to be the result of a conformational change in the TCR complex that occurs upon ligation of the TCR complex. The activation of Lck and Fyn is required for the phosphorylation and activation of the Zap-7 0 protein tyrosine kinase that is bound to the cytoplasmic domain of the TCR zeta chain. The phosphorylation of Zap-7 0 by Lck and Fyn initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of transcription factors and T cell proliferation.",
  "The heart is a highly specialized contractile organ that converts chemical energy into mechanical energy through the process of contraction and relaxation. The heart is composed of two types of muscle cells, cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Cardiac myocytes are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body and are organized into a laminar structure, the myocardium. Cardiac myocytes are elongated and multinucleated cells. Each myocyte is separated from its neighbors by a network of extracellular matrix, the extracellular matrix (ECM). The contractile apparatus of cardiac myocytes consists of a highly organized array of contractile proteins, actin, myosin, and associated proteins. The contractile apparatus is called the sarcomere. The contractile force of cardiac myocytes is generated by the sliding of actin and myosin filaments under the control of Ca2 +. The intracellular Ca2 + concentration is regulated by the release of Ca2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the reuptake of Ca2 + into the SR. The Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX) and the sarcolemmal Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) are responsible for Ca2 + transport across the plasma membrane and the SR, respectively. The sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), which inhibits the activity of the SERCA. The inhibitory effect of PLB is relieved by phosphorylation of PLB by PKA or by Ca2 + binding to CaM kinase II. The NCX is regulated by the Na + concentration and the filling state of the intracellular Na + pool. The force-frequency relationship (FFR) is a fundamental property of the heart. The increase in heart rate enhances the force of contraction and the rate of relaxation. The increase in heart rate is associated with an increase in the intracellular Ca2 + concentration, which is the basis for the increase in the FFR.",
  "The TNF family of cytokines are involved in the regulation of cellular responses to infection, inflammation, and apoptosis. The TNF family is comprised of at least two groups, the death domain containing ligands such as Fas, TNF, and TRAIL, and the TNF-related factors such as RANKL and CD4 0L. The binding of these factors to their receptors leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins to the receptor cytoplasmic domain. The TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) are adaptor proteins that are recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of the TNF receptor family. The TRAF proteins are recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of the TNF receptor family by the TRAF domain of the receptor. The TRAF domain is a conserved region of approximately 5 0 amino acids that is found in several proteins involved in signal transduction, including the TNF receptor family members, the IL-1R1, the BCK oncogene, the TRAF family of proteins, and the cellular homolog of the viral oncogene v-p34gag. The TRAF domain is responsible for recruiting the TRAF proteins to the receptor complex. The death domain containing factors such as FADD, TRADD, and RIP are recruited to the receptor complex through interaction with the TRAF domain of the receptor. The death domain containing factors are responsible for transducing the apoptotic signal. The binding of FADD to the Fas receptor leads to the recruitment of caspase-8 through the interaction of their respective death domains. The recruitment of caspase-8 to the TNF receptor complex leads to the activation of caspase-8 and the subsequent cleavage of Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, to its truncated form, tBid. The translocation of tBid to the mitochondria leads to the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9. The activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 leads to the activation of the downstream caspases and the execution of the apoptotic program.",
  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Mutations in alpha-synuclein, parkin, UCHL1, DJ1, and PINK1 have been linked to autosomal-dominant or -recessive forms of PD. These mutations lead to the accumulation of toxic protein species, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and ultimately cell death. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, parkin, UCHL1, and DJ1 are associated with autosomal-dominant forms of PD. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, parkin, and UCHL1 are associated with autosomal-recessive forms of PD. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, parkin, UCHL1, and DJ1 are associated with increased protein aggregation and neurotoxicity. Parkin and UCHL1 are involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is responsible for the degradation of abnormal and misfolded proteins. Mutations in parkin and UCHL1 result in a loss of function of these proteins, leading to the accumulation of toxic protein species. DJ1 is an oxidative stress response protein that is involved in mitochondrial function. Mutations in parkin and DJ1 lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mutations in alpha-synuclein result in an increase in the amount of the protein, which may lead to the formation of toxic protein aggregates.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins plays a key role in development and tissue homeostasis. Wnt proteins bind to cell surface receptors of the Frizzled family and activate a signaling pathway that regulates gene expression through the transcription factor TCF / LEF. Wnt signaling regulates gene expression by two different mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the stabilization of beta-catenin, a key component of the wnt signaling pathway, and its subsequent association with the TCF / LEF transcription factors. This leads to the activation of TCF / LEF-regulated genes. The second mechanism involves the association of TCF / LEF factors with the coactivator CBP / p300. TCF / LEF factors are DNA binding proteins that interact with the coactivator CBP / p300 through a conserved C-terminal domain. Wnt signaling inhibits CBP / p300 interaction with TCF / LEF factors, resulting in the transcriptional repression of TCF / LEF-regulated genes.",
  "The Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in development, regulating cell proliferation and cell fate. The hallmark of Wnt signaling is the stabilization of beta-catenin, which enters the nucleus and forms a complex with TCF to activate transcription. The Wnt receptor complex is Frizzled and LRP-5 / 6. In the absence of Wnt, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3, ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome. Binding of Wnt to Frizzled and LRP-5 / 6 inhibits GSK-3, preventing beta-catenin phosphorylation, resulting in beta-catenin accumulation and translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus, beta-catenin activates transcription through TCF family transcription factors. Wnt signaling is blocked by the tumor suppressor APC, which binds beta-catenin and promotes its degradation. Mutations in APC are found in many colon cancers, and mutations in beta-catenin are found in some melanomas. Other proteins that regulate beta-catenin stability include axin, which forms a complex with APC and GSK-3, and the p90 protein family, which opposes GSK-3. Other proteins that regulate beta-catenin stability and / or transcriptional activity include CBP, Jade-1, and Dvl-1. The transcriptional targets of beta-catenin include cyclin D1 and c-myc, both of which are involved in cell cycle regulation.",
  "Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically encoded cellular suicide mechanism that eliminates damaged, infected, or unwanted cells. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are involved in apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that are proteolytically cleaved to generate two active enzymes. Caspases cleave a variety of cellular substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, signaling molecules, and structural proteins, that lead to cellular disassembly and death. Caspases are divided into two groups: the initiator caspases (caspases-2, -8, -9, and -1 0) that are activated by specific cleavage, and the effector caspases (caspases-3, -6, and-7) that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is triggered by the binding of ligands to cell surface receptors, such as Fas / CD9 5, and is mediated by caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates caspase-3, the effector caspase. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, and oxidative stress. These stimuli lead to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then associates with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form a multimeric complex called the apoptosome. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3.",
  "The control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression. In eukaryotes, mRNA degradation plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In the 5 'to 3' mRNA decay pathway, mRNAs are deadenylated prior to decapping and subsequent 5 'to 3' exonucleolytic degradation. In the 3 'to 5' pathway, the exosome, a large complex of 3 'to 5' exoribonucleases, degrades intact RNA molecules. In addition to these two pathways, there are other pathways of mRNA decay, such as nonsense-mediated decay, no-go decay and no-go-decay.",
  "The water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is expressed in the kidney collecting duct and is essential for water homeostasis. AQP2 is localized in the apical plasma membrane of collecting duct cells and is concentrated in vesicles in the subapical region under basal conditions. Vasopressin (AVP), the antidiuretic hormone, regulates water homeostasis by inducing the translocation of AQP2-containing vesicles to the apical plasma membrane, thereby increasing the urinary concentration. AVP binds to the V2 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, and activates the Gs-protein-mediated cAMP signaling pathway. The activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by cAMP phosphorylates AQP2, which induces AQP2 vesicle accumulation near the plasma membrane by inhibiting their endocytosis. The increased water permeability of the apical plasma membrane facilitates water reabsorption, causing water excretion in the urine.",
  "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is characterized by the presence of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein. The PML-RARalpha fusion protein is generated from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 1 5 and 1 7 that fuses the PML gene on chromosome 1 5q2 2 to the RARalpha gene on chromosome 1 7q2 1. The PML-RARalpha fusion protein has been shown to play a key role in APL pathogenesis. The PML-RARalpha fusion protein acts as a dominant-negative mutant of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha). The PML-RARalpha fusion protein disrupts the normal functions of both PML and RARalpha. The disruption of PML-RARalpha functions leads to aberrant transcriptional regulation, abnormal apoptosis, and genomic instability. The RARalpha fusion protein interferes with the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in myeloid differentiation, such as the transcription factor PU.1 and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The PML-RARalpha fusion protein also interferes with the function of the tumor suppressor p53. The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. The disruption of p53 function by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein contributes to the pathogenesis of APL. The PML-RARalpha fusion protein also disrupts the normal functions of the PML protein. The PML protein is a tumor suppressor that is involved in apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair. The disruption of PML function by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein contributes to the pathogenesis of APL. The normal function of the RARalpha protein is required for normal myeloid differentiation. The disruption of the normal function of RARalpha by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein contributes to the pathogenesis of APL. The disruption of PML and RARalpha function by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein contributes to the pathogenesis of APL.",
  "Leukocyte adhesion is a fundamental process in inflammation and immunity. The leukocyte adhesion cascade begins with the initial tethering of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium by selectins expressed on the leukocyte and endothelial cell surfaces. The interaction between P-, E- and L-selectins and their ligands mediates leukocyte rolling. Adhering leukocytes become activated and express integrins that bind their respective ligands on the endothelium. The interaction between integrins and their ligands mediates firm adhesion and leukocyte diapedesis into the tissue. The leukocyte integrins LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) and Mac-1 (macrophage-1 antigen) bind their endothelial ligands ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and ICAM-2, and ICAM-3. The interaction between Mac-1 and its endothelial ligand ICAM-1 is required for neutrophil migration into tissues during inflammation.",
  "The T-cell receptor (TCR) complex is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens (Ag) in the context of MHC proteins. The TCR is a multi-subunit complex consisting of the alpha and beta chains that bind the specific antigen, the CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta1 chains that bind the MHC, and the CD24 co-receptor. The CD3 complex is required for the expression and normal function of the TCR. The CD3 complex is also required for the transduction of the T-cell activation signal. The CD3 complex is associated with the src-family kinase lck and the fyn kinase. The activation of the T-cell receptor results in the phosphorylation of the CD3 complex and the src kinases. The phosphorylation of the CD3 complex leads to the recruitment of the ZAP-7 0 kinase to the TCR complex and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The activation of T cells also requires the presence of costimulatory signals provided by the B7 family of molecules. The activation of the T-cell receptor also results in the induction of apoptosis in the T cell when the T cell receptor is not engaged by antigen. The induction of apoptosis by the T cell receptor is mediated by the transcription factor p55 / p5RB110. The p55 / p5RB110 induces the expression of the gene encoding the bcl2 protein which inhibits apoptosis.",
  "The inflammatory cytokine TNF is a key mediator of the immune response. In addition to its role in inflammation, TNF is involved in a number of other processes, including apoptosis, cell survival, and the regulation of the cell cycle. The biological effects of TNF are mediated by two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Binding of TNF to TNFR1 leads to the recruitment of several proteins to the receptor complex, including TRADD, TRAF2, RIP, and the kinases RIP and NIK. RIP and NIK activate the NF-kB transcription factor, while TRAF2 appears to play a role in the activation of both NF-kB and JNK pathways. RIP and TRAF2 are essential for TNF-induced NF-kB activation, but are not required for JNK activation. RIP is also required for TNF-induced apoptosis, while TRAF2 is not. The kinase activity of RIP is not required for NF-kB activation, but is essential for JNK activation and apoptosis. The kinase activity of NIK is not required for NF-kB activation, but is required for JNK activation and apoptosis. The activation of NF-kB by TNF is a key component of the cellular response to TNF and is mediated by the kinase activity of RIP. The activation of NF-kB by TNF also leads to the induction of the inhibitor of NF-kB, IkB. IkB binds to the transcription factor NF-kB and prevents it from entering the nucleus and activating the transcription of target genes. The activation of NF-kB by TNF blocks apoptosis and may play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle.",
  "The protein alpha-synuclein is a member of a family of proteins that includes beta-synuclein and gamma-synuclein. The alpha-synuclein gene is located on chromosome 4q2 1-2 2 and is expressed primarily in neurons. The alpha-synuclein protein is a natively unfolded monomer that can form beta-pleated sheet aggregates, called oligomers, that are the major component of Lewy bodies, the hallmark of Parkinson's disease. The normal function of alpha-synuclein is not known, but it is expressed in presynaptic terminals and may play a role in synaptic plasticity. Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene have been associated with some forms of Parkinson's disease, and alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies. The A5 3T mutation increases the propensity of alpha-synuclein to form aggregates, and the A3 0P and A5 3T mutations increase the tendency of alpha-synuclein to form fibrils. The alpha-synuclein gene is a candidate for some cases of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease. The alpha-synuclein protein is ubiquitinated in Lewy bodies, and the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) parkin appears to be involved in the ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein. The parkin gene is mutated in some cases of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, and parkin may normally play a role in the degradation of alpha-synuclein. The identification of alpha-synuclein mutations in some cases of Parkinson's disease and the role of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies suggests that alpha-synuclein may be involved in other neurodegenerative disorders.

  "Platelet adhesion to the subendothelium is a key event in the formation of a haemostatic plug or a thrombus. The first step in this process is the interaction of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex with collagen, which triggers the activation of the platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (GPIIb-IIIa) complex. The binding of fibrinogen and other plasma proteins to activated alpha IIb beta 3 (GPIIb-IIIa) mediates platelet aggregation and the formation of a haemostatic plug. The interaction of activated alpha IIb beta 3 (GPIIb-IIIa) with fibrinogen is a key event in the formation of a thrombus at a site of vascular injury.

  "Cell motility is a complex process that requires the coordinated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. Rho family GTPases are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. The Rho GTPases cycle between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho GTPases by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho proteins to inactivate them. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind to Rho GTPases and inhibit their interaction with GEFs and GAPs. Guanine exchange factors are further classified into Dbl family GEFs and Lbc family GEFs. The Dbl family GEFs contain a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which functions to regulate the exchange activity of the DH domain. The Lbc family GEFs contain a DH domain and a regulator of Rho GEFs (RGS) domain. The Lbc family GEFs are unique in that they also contain a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain, which is involved in the regulation of G-protein signaling by GPCRs. The Lbc family GEFs are involved in the regulation of cell motility, gene transcription, and cardiac hypertrophy. The Dbl family GEFs interact with downstream targets through their DH domains. The Dbl family GEFs activate Rho GTPases by stimulating the release of the bound GDP and subsequent binding of GTP. The Dbl family GEFs include Vav, Sos, Dbl, and Ect2. The Dbl family GEFs are further classified into two groups based on the presence of additional domains. The first group includes Vav, Sos, and Dbl. The second group includes Lbc and Ect2. The Dbl family GEFs activate Rho, Rac, and Cdc4 2. The Lbc family GEFs include Lbc, GEF-H1, and Trio. The Lbc family GEFs are involved in the regulation of cell motility, gene transcription, and cardiac hypertrophy. The Dbl family GEFs are activated by various stimuli including GPCRs, tyrosine kinases, and phosphoinositides. The Dbl family GEFs are also regulated by intramolecular interactions and by protein-protein interactions. The Dbl family GEFs are further classified into three subgroups based on their regulatory mechanisms. The first group includes Vav, Sos, and Dbl. The second group includes TrioC and GEF-H1. The third group includes Dbs and Ect2. The Dbl family GEFs are activated by tyrosine kinases and phosphoinositides. The Dbl family GEFs are also regulated by intramolecular interactions and protein-protein interactions. The Dbl family GEFs are also regulated by protein-protein interactions. The Lbc family GEFs are activated by the adaptor protein NHERF. The Lbc family GEFs are also activated by the adaptor protein paxillin. The Dbl family GEFs are also regulated by protein-protein interactions. The Dbl family GEFs are also regulated by the adaptor protein intersectin.",
  "The biosynthesis of methionine from homocysteine is a major source of methyl groups in plants. The first committed step in this pathway is the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to serine to produce methionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine. The next two steps are catalyzed by the enzyme O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (EC 4. 2.9 9. 8). The enzyme is a member of a gene family in plants and bacteria. The enzyme is inhibited by the herbicide propargyl-cysteine and by some antibiotics such as sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine. The enzyme is also inhibited by the insecticide dichlorvos. S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (EC 3. 3.1. 1) catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine to adenosine and homocysteine. Homocysteine is a key intermediate in methionine metabolism and is converted to cysteine by two different pathways. In plants, methionine is converted to cysteine via cystathionine. In bacteria and in the animal liver and kidney, methionine is converted to cystathionine via methyltetrahydrofolate and serine. In bacteria and in the animal liver, cystathionine is cleaved to form cysteine and homocysteine.",
  "The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a multi-protein complex that is expressed on the surface of B cells and is required for the recognition of antigen and the activation of B cells. The BCR is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains and two Ig light chains that are non-covalently associated with the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 proteins. The Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 proteins are members of the Ig-superfamily that contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that are phosphorylated upon BCR ligation and activation. The phosphorylation of the ITAMs in Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 leads to the activation of protein tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling pathways. The activation of B cells by the BCR is required for the generation of antibodies that provide immunity against infection. The BCR is also expressed on the surface of some B cell lymphomas and is required for the survival and proliferation of these cells. The BCR is continuously internalized and recycled back to the cell surface, and the rate of internalization and recycling is regulated by the phosphorylation of the ITAMs. The BCR is also modified by the addition of N-glycans in the CD21 region of the Ig heavy chain. The addition of N-glycans to the CD21 region of the BCR may regulate the internalization and recycling of the BCR.",
  "The CD28 gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail that is expressed primarily in T cells and NK cells. The extracellular domain of CD28 binds to the costimulatory ligands CD112 and CD113 (LFA-3) expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Interaction of CD28 with its ligands activates T cells and NK cells and is required for normal immune responses. The cytoplasmic domain of CD28 does not contain intrinsic kinase activity, but recruits a variety of signaling molecules to the plasma membrane. The most well characterized CD28 signaling pathway involves the protein kinase Lck and the adapter protein Shc. Lck phosphorylates CD28 on two tyrosine residues, creating a binding site for the SH2 domain of Shc. Shc recruits Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1, which activates the ras pathway. The ras pathway leads to activation of the Map kinases Erk1 and Erk2, and the transcription factor AP-1. The interaction of CD28 with the transcription factor AP-1 may contribute to the activation of T cells by CD28. The interaction of CD28 with the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-7 0 also contributes to T cell activation. The interaction of CD28 with Lck and ZAP-7 0 is required for normal immune responses. The interaction of CD28 with Lck and ZAP-7 0 may also contribute to the ability of CD28 to transform T cells. The interaction of CD28 with the T cell receptor (TCR) complex may also contribute to T cell activation. The interaction of CD28 with Lck may increase the efficiency of TCR signaling by increasing the local concentration of Lck at the plasma membrane. The interaction of CD28 with the TCR may also increase the sensitivity of T cells to antigen by increasing the lifetime of the TCR-pMHC interaction.",
  "Colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. CSF-1 is also a growth factor for cells of the osteoclast lineage and is essential for osteoclast development. The CSF-1 receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the same family as the receptors for the growth factors EGF, VEGF, and HGF. CSF-1 binding to the CSF-1 receptor activates a number of signaling pathways, including the ras / MAP kinase pathway, the PI3 kinase pathway, and the Jak / Stat pathway. These pathways in turn regulate the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation. The ets family of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of genes involved in differentiation and the immune response. The ets family member PU.1 is required for macrophage and osteoclast development. The ets family member Spi-1 is required for the development of B cells and T cells. The ets factor NERF-1 is involved in the regulation of the interferon-beta gene. The regulation of the interferon-beta gene by NERF-1 is repressed by histone deacetylase activity recruited by NERF-1 through interaction with the transcriptional corepressor mSin3A. The regulation of the interferon-beta gene by NERF-1 is also regulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A.",
  "Glycolysis is a fundamental pathway that produces ATP and NADH from glucose. It also plays an important role in the production of important metabolites, such as pyruvate, which is converted to oxaloacetate in the Krebs cycle. The pathway is divided into two parts, the preparatory phase and the hydrolysis phase. The preparatory phase involves the conversion of glucose to fructose-6P, which is then converted to glyceraldehyde-3P, before it is converted to pyruvate in the hydrolysis phase. The pathway is regulated by a variety of enzymes, including the key regulatory enzyme phosphofructokinase. The activity of phosphofructokinase is regulated by a variety of factors, including pH, AMP, ADP, fructose-6P, and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate.",
  "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow and blood. Genetic alterations that deregulate proliferation and survival signaling pathways are common in AML. These include mutations in the FLT3 gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in about one-third of patients, and mutations in the NPM1 gene, which encodes nucleophosmin, in about one-third of patients. Other genetic alterations include chromosomal translocations that result in the formation of fusion genes encoding aberrant proteins with deregulated transcriptional regulatory activity. These include the fusion genes AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha, CBFB-MYH1 1, MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, and TEL-AML1. The fusion proteins encoded by these genes interfere with hematopoietic differentiation and / or promote proliferation. The FLT3-ITD mutation leads to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the RAS / MAPK and PI3 kinase pathways. The constitutive activation of FLT3-ITD may also contribute to its anti-apoptotic activity.",
  "The Fc receptor for IgG (FcgammaR) is a key component of the immune system. It is expressed on the surface of many hematopoietic cells, including B cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and platelets. FcgammaR is responsible for the opsonization of foreign particles and the activation of cells that are involved in the immune response. FcgammaR is also the receptor for the Fc portion of IgG in immune complexes. Cross-linking of FcgammaR leads to the activation of a variety of signaling pathways, including the tyrosine kinases Lyn and FGR, the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav. These signaling events result in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipase D (PLD). These events lead to phagocytosis and degranulation of secretory lysosomes.",
  "Killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLRs) are a family of inhibitory and activating cell surface receptors expressed on NK cells and some T cells. The inhibitory KLRs recognize MHC-I and inhibit NK cell activation. Activating KLRs include 2B4, CD9 4, and NKG2D. 2B4 and CD9 4 associate with the signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM) family of adaptor proteins, which contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM). 2B4 and CD9 4 associate with the adaptor protein SAP (SLAM-associated protein). SAP is mutated in patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). NKG2D is an activating receptor that associates with the DAP1 0 adaptor protein. 2B4 and NKG2D are also expressed by activated T cells. 2B4 and NKG2D are involved in the lysis of tumor cells and virus-infected cells.",
  "The complement system is a group of plasma proteins that can be activated by the immune system to form a response against invading pathogens. The complement system is activated by three different pathways. The classical pathway is activated by antibody-antigen complexes, the lectin pathway is activated by carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria, and the alternative complement pathway is activated by bacteria that have not been phagocytosed by the host's cells. All three pathways converge on the formation of C3 convertase, which cleaves the C3 complement protein into C3a and C3b. The cleavage of C3 creates the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. The formation of the C3 convertase and the C5 convertase are the two key steps in the complement cascade. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3 molecules to create the amplification loop. The C3 convertase also cleaves C5 to create the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC), which lyses bacteria and can also lyse cells in the host's body. The formation of the C3 convertase is inhibited by complement factor I (CFI). Complement factor I is inhibited by complement factor H (CFH). The lectin pathway is activated by the mannan-binding lectin (MBL). MBL is part of the immune response to bacteria and viruses. When MBL binds to carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria, MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) are activated. MASP-1 and MASP-2 are serine proteases that activate the complement system. The lectin pathway is similar to the alternative complement pathway in that the C3 convertase is formed and the amplification loop is created. The lectin pathway is different from the alternative complement pathway in that there is no need for C3 convertase formation. The alternative complement pathway is initiated by the spontaneous cleavage of C3. Once C3 is cleaved, it can form the C3 convertase. The alternative complement pathway is also regulated by complement factor H (CFH). The lectin pathway and the alternative complement pathway are both important in the immune response to bacteria. The lectin pathway is also important in the immune response to viruses. If the complement system is not activated properly, the body is not able to fight bacteria or viruses. If the complement system is not activated properly, the body can become overactive and can become septic. If the complement system is not activated properly, the body can become septic. Inappropriate activation of the complement system can cause autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. People with too much complement activity can be septic. People with too little complement activity can be septic too. People with too much of the inhibitory factor H (CFH) can be septic too. People with too little of the inhibitory factor H (CFH) can be septic too. People with too much of the activating factor MASP-1 or MASP-2 can be septic too.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid metabolite with a diverse set of actions. It is formed by the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase (SPHK). S1P can be dephosphorylated by S1P lyase to phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal or it can be irreversibly attached to phosphoethanolamine by the action of S1P lyase. S1P is a ligand for five different G-protein coupled receptors (EDG1-5). The EDG receptors are coupled to pertussis-sensitive G-proteins and are involved in the regulation of cell migration, proliferation and survival. The EDG receptors are widely expressed in many tissues and cell types. The S1P lyase is a key enzyme in the control of intracellular S1P levels. It is induced by the tumor suppressor gene L2L3 and is involved in the control of apoptosis. The S1P lyase is a mitochondrial enzyme and its activity is enhanced by oxidative stress. S1P is also involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and lymphocyte trafficking.",
  "Chondroitin sulfate is a linear polysaccharide consisting of disaccharide units of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and uronic acids. Chondroitin sulfate chains are modified at the C-6 position of the GalNAc by sulfation, epimerization, or both. The chondroitin polymerizing factor (ChPF) catalyzes the polymerization of the disaccharide units. ChPF is a bifunctional enzyme that also has N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity. The chondroitin synthases (ChSases) catalyze the formation of chondroitin from UDP-GalNAc and GlcNAc. Chsase-I and Chsase-II are exoglycosidases that remove the polysaccharide chains from chondroitin. Chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E) is a chondroitin sulfate with a disaccharide unit, GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc (4S, 6S), in which the 4-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues are both overly abundant. Chondroitin sulfate is a component of cartilage and is also found in the extracellular matrix of the brain.

  "The development of the heart is a complex process involving the coordinated expression of a large number of genes. The transcription factor Mef2c plays a key role in the development of the cardiac muscle. Mef2c is expressed in the precardiac mesoderm and its expression is maintained in the developing heart. Mice lacking Mef2c die at embryonic day 1 0. 5 with defects in cardiac morphogenesis. Mef2c is a member of the myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) family of transcription factors that bind DNA as dimers with members of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2) family. Mef2c forms heterodimers with Mef2a or Mef2b and binds DNA as a Mef2c / Mef2a or Mef2c / Mef2b heterodimer. The Mef2c / Mef2a dimer is expressed in the developing heart and brain, while the Mef2c / Mef2b dimer is expressed in the developing heart and skeletal muscle. The activity of Mef2c is regulated by phosphorylation of conserved residues in the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain. The transcriptional activity of Mef2c is repressed by phosphorylation of Serines 4 1 2 and 4 6 6 by PKA, PKC and CaM kinase. The transcriptional activity of Mef2c is activated by dephosphorylation of Serines 4 1 2 and 4 6 6 by the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin is activated by calcium influx through the L-type calcium channel and calmodulin. The activity of Mef2c is also regulated by its interaction with transcriptional co-factors. The transcriptional activity of Mef2c is repressed by the transcriptional co-repressor HDAC5. The interaction of Mef2c with HDAC5 is regulated by phosphorylation of Serines 2 5 9 and 4 9 8 by PKD and CaMKIV. The interaction of Mef2c with the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha is required for the normal development of the heart. The interaction of Mef2c with PGC-1alpha is regulated by the transcriptional repressor ICER. Mice lacking ICER die at embryonic day 1 0 with defects in cardiac development. The interaction of Mef2c with PGC-1alpha is required for the normal expression of the slow type myosin heavy chain gene.",
  "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is a key component of the gamma-secretase complex that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilin-1 is also involved in the cleavage of other proteins, including the Notch receptor, that are important in development. Presenilin-1 is a multi-domain protein with a hydrophilic loop that is thought to be in the lipid bilayer. Presenilin-1 is cleaved in its hydrophilic loop by the protease signal peptidase to generate two fragments, an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) that remain associated. The NTF and CTF are then cleaved within the loop to release two fragments, an extracellular fragment (NTF) and an intracellular fragment (CTF) that is a component of the gamma-secretase complex. The gamma-secretase complex is made up of four proteins: Presenilin-1, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2. The active gamma-secretase complex is localized in the membrane of the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. The cleavage of APP and Notch by gamma-secretase requires prior cleavage of APP and Notch by beta-secretase (BACE and PS-2, respectively). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase releases the Abeta peptide, which is the major component of senile plaques in the brains of patients with AD. The Abeta peptide is 3 9-4 3 amino acids in length and is aggregated and deposited in the brain to form senile plaques. The gamma-secretase cleavage of APP also releases a cytoplasmic fragment that enters the nucleus and may play a role in transcriptional regulation. The cleavage of Notch by gamma-secretase releases an intracellular domain that enters the nucleus and may also play a role in transcriptional regulation. Presenilin-1 is also involved in the cleavage of other proteins, including cadherins, CD4 4 and E-cadherin, that are involved in cell adhesion.",
  "Neuroblastoma is a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system that occurs in children. Neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous disease, with a wide spectrum of clinical behavior. Some neuroblastomas are biologically favorable, whereas others are biologically unfavorable. Clinically, patients with favorable tumors are cured with surgery and chemotherapy, whereas patients with unfavorable tumors have a poor prognosis and require more intensive therapy. Amplification of the MYCN gene is the most powerful prognostic marker in neuroblastoma. MYCN is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Amplification of MYCN occurs in 2 5% of primary neuroblastomas and is associated with an aggressive clinical course and rapid tumor progression. Amplification of MYCN leads to high-level expression of the protein, and high-level expression of MYCN is associated with rapid tumor cell proliferation. Amplification of MYCN is associated with a more rapid tumor cell proliferation and a more aggressive clinical course. Amplification of MYCN is associated with a more rapid tumor cell proliferation and a more aggressive clinical course. Amplification of MYCN is associated with high-level expression of the protein, and high-level expression of MYCN is associated with a more rapid tumor cell proliferation and a more aggressive clinical course. Amplification of MYCN occurs in approximately 25% of primary neuroblastomas and is associated with an aggressive clinical course and rapid tumor progression. Amplification of MYCN occurs in tumors with a poor prognosis and is associated with high-level expression of the protein, whereas tumors without amplification of MYCN have low-level expression of MYCN.

  "Proteoglycans are a class of complex carbohydrates that are covalently attached to proteins through a linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcA-Gal-GlcNAc). The linkage tetrasaccharide is formed by transfer of xylose from UDP-xylose to serine residues in the core proteins. The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains that are covalently attached to the core proteins are formed by the stepwise addition of monosaccharides, catalyzed by the enzymes listed in the diagram. The linkage tetrasaccharide is not a substrate for further chain polymerization. The first sugar added is N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), followed by galactose (Gal), glucuronic acid (GlcA), and then N-acetylmannosamine (Man). The repeating disaccharide units are extended by the addition of sulfate groups and by the addition of other sugars. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains are sulfated at C4 and C6 of GalNAc, and at C3 of GlcNAc. Dermatan sulfate (DS) chains are sulfated at C4 and C6 of GlcNAc.

  "The innate immune system detects viral infection through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and induces type I interferon production and other antiviral molecules. Viral nucleic acids are recognized by cytosolic PRRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5, and trigger signaling cascades that lead to the production of type I interferon. The recognition of viral nucleic acids by PRRs induces the production of type I interferon and other cytokines through the activation of transcription factors, such as IRF and NF-kB. The production of type I interferon is tightly regulated by several mechanisms. The induction of type I interferon is suppressed by negative feedback mechanisms, such as the induction of SOCS family proteins by type I interferon. The induction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1, is also suppressed by negative feedback mechanisms.",

  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that regulates growth and metabolism. The effects of GH are mediated by the growth hormone receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Binding of GH to the GHR activates the JAK / Stat signaling pathway and other signaling pathways. The JAK / Stat pathway is activated by phosphorylation of Stats by JAK2, which in turn translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of genes containing Stat binding sites. Other signaling pathways activated by GH include the Ras / MAPK pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway. The Ras / MAPK pathway is activated by the Shc / Grb2 / Sos pathway, while PI3 kinase is activated by the IRS-1 / Grb-2 / PI3 kinase pathway. Other pathways activated by GH include the p38 kinase pathway and the protein kinase C pathway. The net effect of GH is the activation of a number of pathways that act in concert to regulate growth and metabolism.",
  "Steroid hormones are a class of biologically active compounds that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex, gonads, and other peripheral tissues. The biosynthesis of steroids is initiated by cholesterol, which is converted to pregnenolone by the microsomal enzyme complex known as the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme system. Pregnenolone is converted to progesterone by the microsomal enzyme complex known as the 2 1-hydroxylase complex. The first step in the biosynthesis of all steroids is the removal of the 1 7-hydroxyl group by 1 7alpha-hydroxylase / 1 7, 2 0-lyase. The major route of steroid hormone biosynthesis is from pregnenolone to progesterone, then to deoxycorticosterone, which is converted to corticosterone. Corticosterone is converted to aldosterone by two steps: 1 1beta-hydroxylation and 1 8-oxidation. The third step is the conversion of corticosterone to cortisol by the enzyme 3betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays essential roles in development and tissue homeostasis. Hh proteins bind to patched (ptc), a 1 2-transmembrane protein, to release the inhibition of smoothened (smo). Hh signaling is also regulated by the presence or absence of Hh binding to ptc. Mutations in ptc and smo are associated with human cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Mutations in the Hh pathway are associated with an inherited birth defect, holoprosencephaly.",
  "Skeletal muscle differentiation is regulated by a variety of factors, including the presence of serum and the presence of growth factors such as IGF-1. Serum withdrawal from the culture medium is a potent inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation. Serum withdrawal induces expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p2 1, and the subsequent withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle. The induction of p2 1 by serum withdrawal is mediated by the transcription factor NFAT. The induction of p2 1 and the subsequent withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle are required for skeletal muscle differentiation. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen for skeletal muscle cells and blocks the induction of p2 1 and the subsequent withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle by IGF-1. IGF-1 also induces skeletal muscle differentiation. The inhibition of skeletal muscle differentiation by serum withdrawal and the induction of differentiation by IGF-1 are mediated by the same signaling pathway. Serum withdrawal induces the expression of the IGF-1 receptor and the activation of the IGF-1 receptor by IGF-1 induces skeletal muscle differentiation. The IGF-1 receptor activates the PI3 kinase pathway and the subsequent activation of Akt. The activation of Akt induces skeletal muscle differentiation by inducing the expression of myogenin, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that induces skeletal muscle differentiation. Akt also induces the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p2 1, and the subsequent withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle. The induction of p2 1 by Akt is mediated by the transcription factor, MEF-2. Akt also induces the expression of the myogenic factor, MyoD, by a mechanism that is not yet clear. The induction of MyoD and the subsequent induction of myogenin by IGF-1 are required for IGF-1 to induce skeletal muscle differentiation. The induction of skeletal muscle differentiation by IGF-1 is inhibited by the expression of a dominant negative PI3 kinase or a dominant negative Akt. The induction of skeletal muscle differentiation by IGF-1 is also inhibited by the expression of a constitutively active Mek. Mek activates Erk, which can also induce skeletal muscle differentiation.

  "Intracellular Ca2 + signals are crucial for a large variety of physiological processes in animal cells. They are generated by Ca2 + release from intracellular stores or Ca2 + influx across the plasma membrane. Ca2 + release from internal stores is mediated by inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) or by ryanodine receptors (RYRs). Ca2 + influx is mediated by several different types of channels, including voltage-gated channels (VGCCs), store-operated channels (SOCs), and transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs). Ca2 + release and influx are tightly regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including Ca2 + sensors, Ca2 + buffers, and Ca2 + -permeable channels. Ca2 + signals are decoded by Ca2 + -binding proteins, Ca2 + -sensing proteins, and Ca2 + -dependent proteins.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is activated by binding of its ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). Binding of ligand induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, creating binding sites for intracellular signaling molecules with SH2 domains. The Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway is one of several signaling cascades activated by EGFR and is involved in cell proliferation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated by EGFR and stimulates cell survival and proliferation. The Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway is also involved in the regulation of differentiation.

  "Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine that stimulates the growth and differentiation of B and T cells. The IL-7 receptor is a heterodimer of a gamma chain and a beta chain. The gamma chain is also a component of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors. The beta chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor. The IL-7 receptor is expressed on B and T cells and is not found on other cell types. The IL-7 receptor is expressed on the cell surface for only a short time and is internalized upon ligand binding. The internalization of the IL-7 receptor is not required for IL-7 to stimulate cell growth. The IL-7 receptor is associated with the JAK family of tyrosine kinases and the src family of tyrosine kinases. Upon IL-7 binding the JAK kinases are activated and phosphorylate the beta chain of the IL-7 receptor. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the beta chain serve as docking sites for src kinases and other signaling molecules. The src kinases are activated and phosphorylate downstream targets including STAT transcription factors. STAT factors are phosphorylated by the src kinases and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. Other signaling pathways are also activated by IL-7 including the PI3 kinase pathway and the p38 MAP kinase pathway. The PI3 kinase pathway is involved in cell survival and the p38 pathway is involved in cell cycle progression.

  "Tight junctions (TJs) are the most apical component of the intercellular adhesion structures, the zonula occludens (ZO). They create a selective barrier to the passage of ions and molecules between adjacent cells. TJs are formed by the association of transmembrane proteins, occludin, JAMs, and claudins, with cytoplasmic plaque proteins, ZO-1, ZO-2, and CRB3. ZO proteins interact with actin filaments and with occludin, JAMs, and claudins. CRB3 interacts with PAR-3 and PAR-6, which are also associated with aPKC.

  "Base excision repair (BER) is the major DNA repair pathway for the removal of small, non-helix-distorting lesions that arise from oxidation, alkylation, and deamination of bases. BER can be initiated by one of a number of DNA glycosylases that recognize and excise specific damaged bases, generating an apurinic / apyrimidinic (AP) site. The AP site is incised by an AP endonuclease, generating a 3 '-hydroxyl and a 5' -deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) terminus. DNA Polbeta, a mammalian X-family DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase III (Cdc3L4) catalyze the gap-filling synthesis and ligation steps of BER. Alternatively, the dRP group is removed by the 5 '-dRP lyase activity of Polbeta, and the nick is sealed by DNA ligase I (LIG1).",
  "Interleukin 5 (IL-5) is a cytokine produced by activated T cells that stimulates the growth and activation of eosinophils. Eosinophils are a group of white blood cells that are involved in inflammatory responses. They are also involved in the immune response to parasitic infections. IL-5 is a key cytokine in eosinophil development and activation. It stimulates the production and maturation of eosinophils from bone marrow cells and activates mature eosinophils to migrate to the site of inflammation. The IL-5 receptor is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit (CDR4) and a beta subunit (CD12 7). The IL-5 receptor is expressed on eosinophils and other cells involved in the immune response. The CD12 7 subunit is also part of the IL-3 receptor and the GM-CSF receptor. IL-5 is a key cytokine in the development and activation of eosinophils.

  "Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is distinct from necrosis. It is characterized by a series of cellular changes including cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation, and the subsequent formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies that are rapidly phagocytosed by neighboring cells or macrophages. The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays a central role in apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens that are cleaved into large (p2 0) and small (p1 0) subunits. Caspases are grouped into two classes based on their structure and function. Caspases involved in the initiation phase include caspase-8 and caspase-9, which are activated by the adaptor protein FADD and Apaf-1, respectively. The caspase-3, -6, and -7 effector caspases are activated by these initiator caspases. Caspases are further grouped into two groups based on their requirement of an adaptor protein for activation. Caspases involved in the execution phase include caspase-3, -6, and -7, which are activated by caspase-8 and -9. Activation of caspases results in the cleavage of downstream targets that lead to the cellular changes associated with apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit apoptosis by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c in turn activates Apaf-1, which recruits caspase-9 and activates it. Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins bind to caspases and inhibit their activity. The IAP proteins are expressed in a variety of tissues and are induced by TNF and other cytokines.",
  "Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine that stimulates red blood cell production by binding to its receptor on the surface of red blood cell precursor cells. Binding of EPO to its receptor activates several signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT pathway, the MAPK pathway, and the PI3 kinase pathway. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by EPO through phosphorylation of the receptor associated JAK kinases, JAK2 and TYK2. The STAT transcription factors, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5, are phosphorylated and activated by EPO. The MAPK pathway is also activated by EPO through phosphorylation of Shc, Grb2 and SOS. The PI3 kinase pathway is also activated by EPO through phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Gab1. Activation of these signaling pathways leads to the regulation of genes involved in red blood cell differentiation.",
  "The transcription factor NF-kB is a heterodimer of the NFKB1 (p5 0) and NFKB2 (p5 2) subunits. The NFKB1 gene is located on chromosome 4q2 4-qter and the NFKB2 gene is located on chromosome 2p1 3-24. The NFKB1 gene encodes the precursor protein p1 0 5, which is post-translationally processed to produce the DNA-binding subunit p5 0. The NFKB2 gene encodes the precursor protein p1 0 0, which is post-translationally processed to produce the DNA-binding subunit p5 2.

The activation of NF-kB is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. The activation of NF-kB is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. The activation of NF-kB is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. The activation of NF-kB is blocked by the I-kB proteins. The I-kB proteins are members of a family of proteins that includes I-kB-alpha, I-kB-beta, I-kB-gamma, and I-kB-delta. The I-kB proteins bind to NF-kB and retain it in the cytoplasm. The activation of NF-kB is blocked by the I-kB proteins. The I-kB proteins are phosphorylated by the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of the I-kB proteins by the proteasome. The degradation of the I-kB proteins allows NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of target genes. The activation of NF-kB is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. The activation of NF-kB is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.

  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled form of cell death that is essential for normal development and homeostasis. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that act as central regulators of apoptosis. Caspases are expressed as inactive precursors (pro-caspases) that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases include two major families: the initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -1 0) that respond to apoptotic stimuli such as ligation of death receptors and the effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) that amplify the apoptotic signal. Caspases are activated in a proteolytic cascade. The initial protease in each cascade is a caspase-8 or caspase-9. Once activated, these caspases cleave and activate downstream caspases, resulting in the cellular destruction that typifies apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which in turn activates caspase-9. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent apoptosis by blocking the release of cytochrome c, whereas Bax and Bid promote apoptosis by allowing cytochrome c to leave the mitochondria. Cytotoxic T cells and the Fas-FasL interaction are two pathways that induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis of target cells through the interaction of the Fas ligand (FasL) with the Fas receptor. Binding of FasL to Fas recruits the adaptor protein FADD and the initiator caspase-8 to the membrane-bound form of caspase-8 (Fas-associated death domain protein, FADD). FADD in turn recruits caspase-8 through its death effector domain (DED), resulting in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase-8 activation within the DISC leads to caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Cytotoxic T cell-mediated apoptosis is inhibited by the Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Bid is a substrate of caspase-8 and cleavage by caspase-8 exposes a Bcl-2 homology domain (BH) in Bid that induces the oligomerization of Bax and Bak and the release of cytochrome c. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit apoptosis by blocking the oligomerization of Bax and Bak and the subsequent release of cytochrome c.",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Senile plaques are extracellular deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the proteolytic action of beta- and gamma-secretases. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau. The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that the deposition of Abeta is the primary event that triggers a series of pathological events, including tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic loss, and neuronal death. The formation of Abeta is a dynamic process that is influenced by genetic factors and environmental factors. The aggregation of Abeta is affected by the levels of soluble Abeta monomers, the ratio of soluble Abeta monomers to insoluble Abeta aggregates, and the clearance of Abeta from the brain. The clearance of Abeta is influenced by the levels of Abeta degradation enzymes and Abeta-binding proteins. The levels of Abeta monomers are affected by the levels of APP, alpha-secretase, and beta-secretase. The ratio of soluble Abeta monomers to insoluble Abeta aggregates is affected by the levels of APP, alpha-secretase, and beta-secretase. Abeta clearance is affected by the levels of Abeta degradation enzymes and Abeta-binding proteins. The formation of NFTs is affected by the levels of tau, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5). The levels of tau and GSK-3 beta are affected by the levels of kinases and phosphatases. The levels of cdk5 and calmodulin are affected by the levels of activators and inhibitors.",
  "Cell migration is a fundamental process in multicellular organisms. Cells move in response to extracellular signals, such as growth factors, and intracellular signals, such as changes in the cytoskeleton. Growth factors stimulate migration through receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF receptor, and the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. The Rho family of GTPases also regulates the cytoskeleton and cell migration. The Rho GTPases cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rho. The Dbl oncogene encodes a GEF for Rho, and is a transforming gene. The Dbl oncogene encodes a protein with two domains: a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain is responsible for the GEF activity, and the PH domain is required for the localization of Dbl to the plasma membrane and for its interaction with other proteins. The Dbl oncogene transforms cells in culture and induces tumors in nude mice. The product of the Sis gene is a GEF for Rac, and the Sis oncogene is also a transforming gene. The Dbl oncogene also transforms cells through the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. The 3Y1 src oncogene encodes a protein with tyrosine kinase activity. 3Y1 cells transformed by the src oncogene have elevated levels of activated Rho and Rac.

  "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), a result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9q3 4 and 22q11. The translocation results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein is essential for the pathogenesis of CML. The hallmark of CML is the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which is the cytogenetic hallmark of CML. The Philadelphia chromosome is formed by the translocation of 9q3 4 and 22q11 and results in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). The translocation t (9; 2 2) (q3 4; q1 1) is found in more than 9 0% of CML patients and in a smaller percentage of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The 221 0q11 translocation results in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). The translocation t (9; 2 2) (q3 4; q1 1) is found in 9 0% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in 5% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and in 2% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The BCR gene is located on chromosome 2 2 and is disrupted by the translocation. The ABL gene is located on chromosome 9q3 4 and is fused to the 3 'portion of the BCR gene. The BCR-ABL fusion gene encodes a BCR-ABL oncoprotein with elevated tyrosine kinase activity.

  "The CORVET / HOPS complex is a tethering complex that regulates the function of Rab GTPases and is involved in the docking and fusion of vesicles with specific membrane compartments. The CORVET / HOPS complex is involved in the fusion of vesicles with the late endosome and the vacuole in yeast, and with late endosomes and lysosomes in animal cells. The core of the CORVET / HOPS complex is a heterotetramer consisting of two copies each of Vps1 1p, Vps1 6p, Vps1 8p and Vps3 3p. The yeast CORVET complex also contains Vps3p, Vps8p and Vps3 9p. The mammalian CORVET / HOPS complex contains orthologs of Vps1 1p, Vps1 6p, Vps1 8p and Vps3 3p, but not Vps3p, Vps8p or Vps3 9p. The mammalian CORVET / HOPS complex also contains the proteins Rab5 and Rabaptin-5. The Rab5 GTPase regulates vesicle fusion with the early endosome and is activated by the exchange factor Rab5p5GEF. The Rabaptin-5 subunit of the CORVET / HOPS complex binds to the activated Rab5 and stabilizes the GTP-bound form of Rab5. The CORVET / HOPS complex also contains the Sec1 / Munc-1 8-like proteins, Vps3 3p and Vps4 1p. Vps3 3p is a PI 3-kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol on the 3-position of the inositol ring. The yeast CORVET complex also contains the Sec1 / Munc-1 8-like protein, Vps3 9p, which is not found in the mammalian complex.

  "The nucleolus is a nuclear subcompartment that is involved in ribosome biogenesis. The biogenesis of ribosomes is a fundamental activity of the cell and is coordinated with cell growth and proliferation. Ribosome biogenesis is a complex and energy-consuming process that requires the coordinated activity of three of the four RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase I is responsible for the transcription of the 3 5S ribosomal RNA, which is a component of the 4 0S subunit, and the 5S RNA, which is a component of the 6 0S subunit. RNA polymerase III transcribes the 5S RNA and the transfer RNAs that are required for the assembly of the subunits of the ribosome. RNA polymerase II transcribes the genes for the ribosomal proteins and a large number of other essential proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and other processes. The transcription of these genes is coordinated with cell growth and proliferation. The transcription of these three polymerases is regulated by a common set of factors and is coordinately regulated with cell growth and proliferation.",
  "Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that consist of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences and associated proteins. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that adds TTAGGG repeats to the ends of chromosomes and is required for stable maintenance of telomeres. Telomerase is not expressed in most normal human somatic cells, but is expressed in germ cells and in most cancer cells. Telomerase activity is repressed in most normal human cells by the transcriptional repression of the TERT gene, the protein component of the telomerase complex. Telomerase is also repressed in most human somatic cells by the binding of a repressor complex to the TERT promoter. Telomerase is reactivated in most cancer cells, and the repression of the TERT gene in normal cells is relieved by the induction of TERT transcription. The MYC family of transcription factors (c-MYC, N-MYC, and L-MYC) activate the TERT promoter and induce telomerase activity. The RB and p53 pathways repress the TERT promoter. The Wnt / beta-catenin pathway induces TERT transcription and activates telomerase. The RAS / MAPK pathway induces TERT transcription and activates telomerase. The E2F pathway also induces TERT transcription and activates telomerase. The RB and p53 pathways repress TERT transcription. The Wnt / beta-catenin pathway induces TERT transcription and activates telomerase. The RAS / MAPK pathway also induces TERT transcription and activates telomerase. The induction of TERT transcription by the Wnt / beta-catenin pathway is independent of MYC. The activation of telomerase is required for immortalization of human cells and is considered an important step in cellular transformation. The Wnt / beta-catenin pathway is important in development and is also activated in many cancers.",
  "The Rho family of GTPases are a subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. The Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions including cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cell motility. Like other GTPases, the Rho GTPases cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Rho proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind to Rho proteins and keep them in the inactive state in the cytosol. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) also bind to Rho proteins and keep them in the cytosol in the GDP-bound state in the absence of extracellular stimuli. The activation of Rho proteins is regulated by several families of proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GAPs inactivate Rho proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind to Rho proteins and keep them in the inactive state in the cytosol in the absence of extracellular stimuli. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are a large family of proteins. The Dbl family of GEFs is the largest family of Rho GEFs. The Dbl family of GEFs is characterized by the presence of a Dbl homology (DH) domain that is responsible for the GEF activity and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is required for the Dbl family GEFs to be membrane localized and for their activation of Rho GTPases. The Dbl family of GEFs includes Dbl, Vav, Net1, and Tiam1. The Dbl family GEFs are activated by interaction with cell surface receptors, including tyrosine kinase receptors and G-protein coupled receptors. The Dbl family GEFs also include Dbs, Kal1, and Intersectin. The Dbl family GEFs are also regulated by other proteins. The Dock1 8 0 family of GEFs are structurally unrelated to the Dbl family of GEFs, but they also activate Rho GTPases. The Dock1 8 0 family members are activated by the Dock1-like proteins (DOCK1Ls). DOCK1Ls are large proteins with multiple domains. The DHR-2 domain is responsible for the GEF activity. The DHR-1 domain is similar to the Ras-specific GEF domain of the RasGEFs. The PH domain is required for the membrane localization and activation of the Dock1 8 0 family of GEFs. The Crk-associated substrate (Cas) is a docking protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated by several intracellular tyrosine kinases, including FAK, Src, and Abl. The Cas protein interacts with several proteins involved in cell motility, including FAK, Src, and Nck.",
  "Aldosterone regulates sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron by increasing sodium transport through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the tight epithelium of the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron. Aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the cytosol, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA sequences (glucocorticoid response elements, GREs) in the promoter region of ENaC. The MR / GRE complex interacts with other transcription factors, such as HNF-4 and GATA-1, to increase transcription of ENaC. Aldosterone also regulates sodium transport in the distal nephron by a rapid, non-genomic mechanism. Aldosterone activates the small G protein Rho, which stimulates the actin-based cytoskeleton and causes tight junction disruption. This is followed by increased sodium transport through ENaC. The rapid effect of aldosterone on sodium transport is not mediated by the MR or by protein synthesis and is inhibited by the MR antagonist eplerenone. The MR is also involved in the regulation of potassium excretion in the kidney by aldosterone. Aldosterone binds to the MR in the distal nephron, where it stimulates potassium secretion through ENaC. Aldosterone also increases the expression of the serum / glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (Sgk-1), which phosphorylates the renal epithelial sodium channel (rENaC) and Nedd4-2, an ubiquitin-protein ligase. Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 reduces its interaction with rENaC, thereby increasing the number of sodium channels in the apical membrane and stimulating sodium transport.",
  "The cell cycle is driven by the combined action of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cyclin regulatory subunits. CDKs are activated by binding of cyclin subunits, which relieves an inhibitory phosphorylation by CDKs. The activity of CDKs is regulated by CDK inhibitors and activators, as well as by transcription and protein degradation. The E2F family of transcription factors regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and other processes. The activity of E2F is regulated by the RB family of proteins and by CDK-mediated phosphorylation. The checkpoint kinase ATM is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates and thereby activates the checkpoint kinase Chk2. Chk2 in turn phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein p5 3, which induces the expression of the CDK inhibitor p2 1Cip1. The CDK inhibitor p2 1Cip1 inhibits the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of the RB family proteins and the release of E2F and progression through the G1-S transition. At the G1-S boundary, the assembly of the pre-replication complex (ORC, CDC6, CDT1, and MCM proteins) is required for the initiation of DNA replication. The CDK inhibitor p53 plays a central role in this process. It is activated by DNA damage and induces the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis. At the G2-M boundary, the activation of the kinase CDK1 (CDC2) by the phosphatase CDC2 5C triggers the entry into mitosis. The activity of CDK1 is inhibited by the kinase WEE1 and the CDK inhibitors p15Ink4b and p50Ink4b. The activity of WEE1 is regulated by the kinase p21WAF1and the ubiquitin ligase SCF Skp2.",
  "The Fas receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family. The Fas receptor is activated by the Fas ligand (FasL), a member of the TNF gene family. Binding of FasL to Fas induces receptor aggregation and recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein. FADD in turn recruits caspase 8 and caspase 10 via the death effector domain (DED) of FADD. Caspase 8 and caspase 10 are then activated and initiate a proteolytic cascade that results in the cleavage of Bid, a Bcl-2 family member that induces mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3. The activation of caspase-3 leads to the cleavage of a number of cellular substrates and the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis.",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that play a crucial role in the early phase of defense against viral infection and tumor transformation. NK cells do not express antigen-specific receptors but express a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors that regulate their function. The activating receptors include members of the Ig superfamily (NK-, LAIR-1), C-type lectin family (NKG2, CD9 4 / NKG2C), and TNF receptor family (CD1 6). The inhibitory receptors include Ig-like (LIR-1, PD-1) and lectin-like (CD9 4 / NKG2A) receptors. The balance of signals from these receptors determines the functional state of the NK cell. Upon recognition of their ligands on target cells, NK cells release perforin and granzyme to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of many cell types. In skeletal muscle IGF-1 stimulates differentiation. IGF-1 signals through the IGF-1 receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor gene family. The IGF-1 receptor activates several signaling pathways including the PI3 kinase pathway and the MAP kinase pathway. The PI3 kinase pathway is required for IGF-1 stimulated differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. One of the targets of PI3 kinase in skeletal muscle is the Akt / PKB kinase. Akt / PKB is required for IGF-1 stimulated differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. The calcineurin / NFAT pathway is also required for IGF-1 stimulated differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Calcineurin activates NFAT transcription factors, which are required for IGF-1 stimulated differentiation. Calcineurin activates NFAT by dephosphorylating a conserved serine residue in the amino terminus of NFAT. Dephosphorylated NFAT is imported into the nucleus where it activates genes involved in differentiation. Calcineurin / NFAT also regulates genes involved in other aspects of muscle differentiation. Calcineurin / NFAT activates the expression of myogenin, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that activates genes involved in muscle differentiation. Calcineurin / NFAT also activates the expression of the acetylcholine receptor, which is required for the formation of neuromuscular junctions.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins plays a crucial role in development and disease. Wnt proteins bind to their receptors, members of the frizzled (Fz) family, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP), to activate two distinct signaling pathways. The canonical Wnt / beta-catenin pathway leads to the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus, where it activates Wnt-responsive genes by interacting with TCF / LEF. The non-canonical Wnt / Ca2 + pathway activates Rho and Rac to control cytoskeletal organization. Planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway also called Wnt / PCP pathway leads to the activation of small GTPases Rho and Rac. Rho and Rac activate the JNK kinase to regulate cytoskeletal organization.",
  "The vascular wall is a complex structure formed by an endothelium, an underlying media and an adventitia. Endothelial cells line the inner surface of the vascular wall and play a key role in the regulation of vascular tone, permeability, and platelet aggregation. The contractile apparatus of vascular smooth muscle is located in the myofilaments and is regulated by Ca2 +. Vasoactive agents, such as noradrenaline, angiotensin II, and arginine vasopressin, induce an increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration ([Ca2 +] i), which activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and leads to contraction. The sensitivity of myofilaments to Ca2 + is regulated by the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin (LC2 0) by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and the dephosphorylation of LC2 0 by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Rho kinase (ROCK) and PKCvarepsilon are involved in the Ca2 + sensitization pathway. ROCK phosphorylates and inhibits MLCP, whereas PKCvarepsilon phosphorylates and activates MLCP. The RhoA / ROCK pathway is activated by vasoconstrictor agonists and inhibits the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of MLCP, which leads to an increase in the level of LC2 0 phosphorylation and an increase in the Ca2 + sensitivity of the myofilaments.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins regulates a variety of developmental processes through the Frizzled family of G-protein coupled receptors. Wnt signaling is involved in the development of the central nervous system, skeletal formation, and the regulation of cell proliferation. Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptors and activate at least two distinct signaling pathways. One pathway is mediated by beta-catenin and leads to the activation of genes involved in cell proliferation. The other pathway is mediated by the small G-protein Rac and leads to the activation of the JNK cascade and cytoskeletal changes. The Frizzled receptor family has 1 0 members in vertebrates and one member in Drosophila. Frizzled receptors are predicted to have an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain of Frizzled receptors shares little sequence identity, but contains a highly conserved motif, the PDZ binding motif. The Frizzled receptor binds Disheveled through its C-terminal tail, and this interaction is required for both beta-catenin dependent and independent Wnt signaling. The Disheveled protein is a key component of the Wnt / beta-catenin pathway. In the absence of Wnt signaling, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3 and is targeted for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3, resulting in the stabilization of beta-catenin, its accumulation in the nucleus, and the formation of a complex with members of the LEF / TCF family of transcription factors. The beta-catenin / LEF / TCF complex activates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation. Wnt signaling also regulates cytoskeletal changes through the small G-protein Rac and its downstream kinase PAK. The Frizzled receptor interacts with the cytoplasmic protein Disheveled through its PDZ binding motif. Disheveled activates the small G-protein Rac, which in turn activates JNK. The Frizzled receptor also interacts with the protein kinase Arrow, which is a member of the IRAK family of proteins. Arrow is required for Wnt signaling and is required for the activation of JNK by Frizzled. The Frizzled receptor also interacts with the protein kinase Tyk2. Tyk2 is a member of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases that are involved in cytokine signaling. The Frizzled receptor activates JAK kinases, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors.",
  "The CD28 molecule is a small cell surface protein that is expressed on activated T cells and is involved in T-cell activation. The CD28 molecule is a ligand for the cell surface protein CD24. CD28 and CD24 interact to form a coreceptor that is involved in T-cell activation. The CD28 coreceptor is involved in the activation of T cells by antigen presenting cells.

The Fas protein is involved in the activation of T cells by the immune system.",
  "Cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion are essential for multicellular organism development and maintenance. Cell-cell adhesions are mediated by integrins, a family of transmembrane adhesion receptors. Integrins are formed by noncovalently associated alpha- and beta-subunits. Each integrin heterodimer has its own ligand specificity. Integrins can bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) directly or through transmembrane receptors, such as the dystroglycan complex. Integrins are also involved in cell-cell adhesions, such as those between neurons and astrocytes. The formation of synapses between neurons is also mediated by integrins. The formation of synapses is also dependent on the interaction of neurons with the ECM. The interaction of neurons with the ECM is mediated by the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin. Agrin is cleaved by the protease plasmin in the ECM, releasing a fragment that binds to the LRP4 / MUSK receptor complex and activates MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase. The activation of MuSK leads to the clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) and the formation of neuromuscular junctions.",
  "Cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions are important for the maintenance of tissue architecture and homeostasis. Disruption of these interactions can lead to aberrant cell proliferation and apoptosis, both of which are important steps in the process of tumor formation.

Integrins are a family of cell adhesion molecules that bind to the ECM and mediate cell-cell interactions. The interaction of cells with the ECM is important for the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Disruption of cell-ECM interactions can lead to aberrant cell proliferation and apoptosis.

  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multi-subunit complex that is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens by T cells. The TCR is composed of two subunits, the alpha and beta chains that form the ligand binding site, and four different subunits, gamma, delta, epsilon and theta, that form the signal transduction complex. The CD3 subunits are non-covalently associated with the TCR subunits and are required for the expression of a functional receptor. The CD3 complex is required for the expression of a mature TCR complex on the cell surface and is required for the proper assembly and transport of the receptor through the cell. The activation of T cells by antigen is dependent on the interaction of the TCR with the peptide antigen bound to a MHC molecule on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. The interaction of the TCR with antigen / MHC complex results in the activation of the T cell and the initiation of an immune response. The activation of T cells is dependent on the interaction of the TCR with the CD3 complex and the co-stimulatory signals provided by the interaction of the CD2 8 receptor with its ligand on the T cell with its B7 ligand on the antigen-presenting cell. The activation of T cells is also dependent on the presence of cytokines such as IL-2 that are produced by the interaction of the TCR with the antigen / MHC complex.

  "The biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc to the linkage region tetrasaccharide, Gal (beta1, 3) GlcNAc (beta1, 3GalNAcO-R), which is attached to the serine residue of a serine-linked core protein. The tetrasaccharide is then extended by the addition of repeating disaccharide units, GalNAc (beta1, 4GlcA (beta1, 3)), to form a chondroitin chain. The polymerization of chondroitin sulfate chains is catalyzed by chondroitin polymerizing factor (ChPF). The chondroitin synthases (ChSases), Chas1 and Chas2, catalyze the polymerization of chondroitin. ChSases also catalyze the epimerization of glucuronic acid (GlcA) to iduronic acid (IdoA), which is a critical modification in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate. Chondroitin polymerizing factor (ChPF) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate. ChPF is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the polymerization of chondroitin and the epimerization of glucuronic acid (GlcA) to IdoA. ChPF is a Golgi membrane protein with a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The C-terminal catalytic domain of ChPF is a member of the carbohydrate sulfotransferase (CST) family. The chondroitin synthase reaction proceeds in two steps. In the first step, ChPF transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the linkage region tetrasaccharide, forming a trisaccharide, GalNAc (beta1, 4GlcA (alpha1, 3GalNAcO-R). In the second step, ChPF catalyzes the epimerization of GlcA to IdoA, which completes the polymerization of chondroitin. ChPF is the first glycosyltransferase in the chondroitin / dermatan sulfate biosynthesis pathway that requires a carbohydrate sulfotransferase for its activity. The chondroitin synthases are members of the glycosyltransferase-8 (GT-8) family. Other members of the GT-8 family include the ABO blood group glycosyltransferases, which also catalyze the polymerization of sugars. The chondroitin synthases are unique in that they require a carbohydrate sulfotransferase for their activity. The chondroitin synthases are the only glycosyltransferases that require a carbohydrate sulfotransferase for their activity. The structure and function of ChPF are discussed in this review.",
  "The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated by IGF-1 and IGF-2. The IGF-1R is expressed in many cell types and is involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation. The IGF-1R is involved in transformation by oncogenes such as v-src and v-ras. The IGF-1R is also involved in transformation by the tumor suppressor gene p34. The IGF-1R is a heterodimer with the ligand binding subunit alpha and the tyrosine kinase subunit beta. Binding of IGF-1 or IGF-2 to the IGF-1R activates the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and leads to phosphorylation of substrates and activation of downstream signaling pathways. The pathways downstream of the IGF-1R that lead to transformation are not well defined. The PI-3 kinase pathway is activated by the IGF-1R and is involved in transformation by the IGF-1R. The raf / MEK / Erk pathway is also activated by the IGF-1R and is involved in transformation by the IGF-1R. The p34 pathway is also involved in transformation by the IGF-1R. The p34 pathway leads to activation of the transcription factor CREB and may also lead to activation of other transcription factors.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily contains several members that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Members of this family include Fas, TNFR1, TNFR2, DR3, -4, -5, -6, and -7. The binding of their cognate ligands activates signaling pathways that result in the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kappaB and the induction of apoptosis. The binding of TNF to its receptor activates two distinct signaling pathways. The first pathway is activated by the binding of TNF to TNFR1 and results in the recruitment of the adapter protein TRADD to the receptor. TRADD in turn recruits TRAF2, RIP, and FADD to the receptor complex. This complex is responsible for the activation of NF-kappaB and the induction of apoptosis. The second pathway is activated by the binding of TNF to TNFR2 and results in the recruitment of the TRAF family of proteins to the receptor. The TRAF proteins are involved in the activation of NF-kappaB and the induction of apoptosis.",
  "Platelet adhesion to the vascular endothelium is a key event in the formation of a blood clot. The interaction of platelets with the endothelium is mediated by the interaction of the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 on the platelet with the endothelial cell adhesion molecule PECAM-1. PECAM-1 is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and is involved in the formation of the intercellular junctions between endothelial cells. The interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1 is also involved in platelet activation and aggregation. The interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1 is regulated by the platelet integrin alpha2beta1. When activated by the ligand fibrinogen, alpha2beta1 binds to PECAM-1 and blocks the interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1. The interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1 is also regulated by the platelet integrin Mac-1. When activated by the ligand fibrinogen, Mac-1 binds to PECAM-1 and blocks the interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1. The interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1 is also regulated by the platelet integrin alphaLbeta2. When activated by the ligand ICAM-1, alphaLbeta2 binds to PECAM-1 and blocks the interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1. The interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1 is also regulated by the platelet integrin Mac-1. When activated by the ligand fibrinogen, Mac-1 binds to PECAM-1 and blocks the interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1.

The interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1 is also regulated by the platelet integrin alpha2beta1. When activated by the ligand collagen, alpha2beta1 binds to PECAM-1 and blocks the interaction of alphaIIbbeta3 with PECAM-1.",
  "The apoptotic program is a genetically controlled mechanism of cell death that is activated in response to a variety of stimuli, including cytotoxic T cells. Cytotoxic T cells are lymphocytes that kill virus-infected or transformed cells. Cytotoxic T cells kill target cells by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is the release of perforin and granzyme proteins from the cytotoxic T cell granules into the intercellular space between the cytotoxic T cell and the target cell. Granzyme B is a protease that enters the target cell and activates caspases that induce apoptosis. Perforin forms a pore in the membrane of the target cell, allowing the release of granzyme B into the cytoplasm. The caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that induce apoptosis when activated. The caspases are separated into two groups based on their function and structure. Initiator caspases (caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-2) activate the effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7) that in turn induce apoptosis. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are initiator caspases that activate caspase-3, the effector caspase. The Jun kinase pathway is also involved in apoptosis induced by cytotoxic T cells. Cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in target cells by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is the Fas-Fas ligand interaction. Cytotoxic T cells express Fas ligand and bind to Fas receptors on the surface of target cells. Fas-Fas ligand interaction activates Jun kinase and caspase 8, which in turn activates caspase-3 and induces apoptosis. The second mechanism is induced by perforin and granzyme B. Perforin forms a pore in the membrane of the target cell, allowing the release of granzyme proteins into the cytoplasm of the target cell. Granzyme B activates caspase-3 and induces apoptosis. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are involved in granzyme B-induced apoptosis.",
  "The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that shares structural and functional similarities with the insulin receptor (IR). Both receptors are activated by ligands, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin, and mediate similar biological responses. IGF-1R is widely expressed in many tissues and is involved in the regulation of growth, differentiation, apoptosis, transformation, and other physiological processes. The IGF-1R is also an oncogene and is frequently over-expressed in a variety of human tumors. The IGF-1R is a heterodimer consisting of two extracellular alpha subunits and two beta subunits that are identical to those of the IR. The activation of the IGF-1R is mediated by the binding of ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2 to the extracellular domain of the receptor, which leads to the autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues and the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase. The activated IGF-1R triggers a complex signaling network that includes the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK and PI3K / AKT pathways, which leads to the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, and cell survival.",
  "The amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is the major component of senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic cleavage. The APP is a transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain of APP contains a YENPTY motif that interacts with several proteins. One of the proteins that interacts with APP is Fe6 5. The interaction of APP with Fe6 5 is mediated by the phosphorylation of threonine 6 6 8 (T6 6 8) in APP. The phosphorylation of APP at T6 6 8 is regulated by the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. The phosphorylation of tau also regulates its interaction with microtubules. The interaction of APP with Fe6 5 may regulate APP processing and signaling. The phosphorylation of APP at T6 6 8 also regulates the interaction of APP with the ubiquitin ligase complex containing the proteins elongin B and elongin C. The interaction of APP with the ubiquitin ligase complex regulates the processing of APP and the production of Abeta. The interaction of APP with the ubiquitin ligase complex may also regulate the phosphorylation of tau. The phosphorylation of tau may also regulate its interaction with microtubules. The phosphorylation of tau by cdk5 and GSK-3beta may also regulate the interaction of tau with microtubules. The activation of calpains, calcium-dependent cysteine proteases, may contribute to the pathology of AD by cleaving tau and APP. The cleavage of tau by calpains may also contribute to the formation of paired helical filaments. The cleavage of APP by calpains may also contribute to the formation of Abeta.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGFR is widely expressed in normal tissues and is involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Overexpression of the EGFR has been associated with a number of cancers including brain, breast, lung, colon, and bladder. The EGFR is a heterodimer consisting of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of the EGFR induces receptor dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase domain. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic domain of the EGFR serve as binding sites for signaling molecules containing SH2 or PTB domains. The major signaling pathways activated by the EGFR include the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway and the JAK-STAT pathway.",
  "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. BMPs are involved in many biological processes, including embryonic development, cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and morphogenesis. BMPs are synthesized as precursor proteins that are cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin to produce mature BMPs. The mature BMPs form homodimers or heterodimers that bind to type II and type I serine / threonine kinase receptors. BMPs signal through the SMAD pathway and the MAP kinase pathway. SMADs are intracellular signaling molecules in the TGF-beta superfamily. BMPs bind to type II receptors, which in turn recruit type I receptors. Once the type II and type I receptors are recruited, they form a ligand-receptor complex. The type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor. BMPs activate SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8, which then complex with the co-mediator SMAD4 and then translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription. BMPs can also activate the MAP kinase pathway, which includes the MAP kinase kinase kinase, TAK1, and the MAP kinase kinase, MKK3. BMPs also activate the Wnt / beta-catenin pathway. BMPs inhibit the expression of the homeobox gene Meox2, which is involved in cardiac development. BMPs also activate the expression of the homeobox gene Msx2, which is involved in the development of the neural crest and the branchial arches. BMPs are involved in the differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts. BMPs induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes and osteoblasts.",
  "The Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway is a key signaling cascade that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. The pathway is frequently activated in cancer through a variety of mechanisms, including activating mutations in RAS, B-Raf, or MEK, or inactivating mutations in the p15 (RAF), or p16 (INK4A) tumor suppressors. The p15 (RAF) tumor suppressor is a kinase that phosphorylates and activates the MEK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates the ERK kinases. Activated ERKs translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The cyclin D1 gene is a direct transcriptional target of the ERK pathway, and is induced by growth factors to promote cell cycle progression. The p16 (INK4A) tumor suppressor inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -cyclin complexes that regulate cell cycle progression.",
  "The cyclin D1 gene on chromosome 1 1q1 3 is amplified in approximately 5 0% of human parathyroid adenomas. The cyclin D1 protein product, cyclin D1is a key regulatory component of the cell cycle, and is required for progression from the G1 phase into the S phase. Overexpression of cyclin D1 protein occurs in parathyroid adenomas and parathyroid carcinomas, and may contribute to parathyroid tumorigenesis by interfering with the normal growth-inhibitory function of the retinoblastoma gene product (RB). Cyclin D1 overexpression may also contribute to parathyroid tumorigenesis by interfering with the normal apoptotic function of the BCL2 gene. The cyclin D1 gene is a target of the parathyroid adenoma-associated chromosome 1 1q1 3 amplification. The cyclin D1 protein is stabilized in parathyroid adenomas and parathyroid carcinomas, apparently due to deletion of a parathyroid-specific p10-13 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p16INK4a). The p16INK4a gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted or mutated in many cancers. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a binds to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (cdk4 / 6), and inhibits their catalytic activity. The p16INK4a gene is deleted or mutated in many parathyroid cancers, and may contribute to parathyroid tumorigenesis by releasing the brake on the cell cycle.",
  "Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors that promote neuronal survival and differentiation through the activation of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is the most widely expressed neurotrophin in the adult mammalian nervous system. NT-3 binds to TrkA to exert its survival and differentiation effects. Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) bind to TrkB. NT-3 also binds to TrkC, but with lower affinity. NT-3 binds to the extracellular domain of Trk, inducing receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Trk activation leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Ras / MAP kinase pathway, the PI3 kinase / AKT pathway, and the phospholipase C-gamma pathway. These pathways lead to the activation of transcription factors such as CREB, ELK, and NF-kB, which in turn regulate gene expression.",
  "The GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are a structurally and functionally diverse group of membrane proteins that are covalently attached to the C-terminus via a common glycolipid structure, the GPI anchor. The anchor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a precursor glycolipid, termed the GPI-protein precursor, and is subsequently modified in the Golgi by the addition of various Man and / or GlcNAc residues and by lipid and protein components. The GPI-anchor is attached to the C-terminus of the protein by a transamidase reaction. In mammals, the GPI-anchor is Man (acyl) (4-9) GlcNAc (acyl) -myo-inositol-1P, where Man (acyl) indicates the mannose and GlcNAc residues and myo-inositol indicates myo-inositol. The lipid component of the GPI-anchor is either ceramide or a phosphoethanolamine-based structure. In mammals, the protein component of the GPI-anchor is a polypeptide that is cleaved near the C-terminus by an GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD). In yeast, the GPI-anchor is protein-bound and is not lipid-bound. In yeast, the GPI-anchor consists of a protein-bound peptide with a phosphoethanolamine-based structure and a lipid component.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) contains more than 10 members in mammals that are involved in diverse biological responses, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. The cytoplasmic domain of these receptors contains a death domain that is essential for the induction of cell death. The TNF receptor superfamily also includes the lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR), which is involved in the development and organization of secondary lymphoid tissues. Members of this family can be grouped into two subfamilies on the basis of sequence similarities in the extracellular domain. The first group includes the TNF receptor (TNFR) family, which includes the TNF receptor (TNFR), Fas, DR3, CD4 0, and the TRAIL receptors. The second group includes the LTbetaR and the 4 1BB receptor. Members of this group are not involved in the induction of cell death, but are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and activation. The cytoplasmic domain of these receptors contains a death domain that is essential for the induction of cell death. The binding of TNF or Fas ligand to their respective receptors triggers the recruitment of the cytoplasmic adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) / MORT1. FADD in turn recruits caspase-8 via a death-domain interaction to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase-8 activation results in the cleavage and activation of caspase-3, which mediates the apoptotic response. Caspase-8 can also be recruited to the TNF receptor via TRADD (TNFR-associated death domain protein), another member of the death-domain family. This alternative recruitment of caspase-8 to the TNF receptor does not result in apoptosis, but rather in the activation of NF-kB.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that induces the proliferation and differentiation of cells of the B cell lineage. The IL-6 receptor is a heterodimer, with a ligand-specific alpha chain and a signal-transducing beta chain shared with other cytokines of the IL-6 family. Binding of IL-6 to the IL-6 receptor induces dimerization of the receptor subunits, activation of the JAK kinases, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta chain. The phosphorylated beta chain recruits and activates the transcription factor STAT3, which is activated by phosphorylation on a single tyrosine residue by JAK kinases. STAT3 activates transcription of genes that contain a STAT3 response element, including the gene for the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA). The IL-6 receptor also activates the ras / Map kinase pathway, and this pathway contributes to the activation of genes like c-fos and junB that are not regulated by STAT3.",
  "The selectin family of adhesion molecules are carbohydrate binding proteins expressed on the surface of leukocytes and platelets that mediate the initial steps of inflammation by binding to carbohydrate ligands on the surface of endothelial cells. The selectins bind to ligands with the saccharide motif sialyl-Lewis (a). The selectins are important in the immune response, as well as in inflammation. The selectins are also involved in other biological processes such as blood clotting and embryogenesis. The three members of the family, P-, E- and L-selectin, are found on the surface of leukocytes and platelets. P-selectin is found on the surface of platelets and is released upon activation of platelets. P-selectin binds to the carbohydrate ligand sialyl-Lewis (a) on inflamed endothelium. E-selectin is found on the surface of endothelial cells and is released upon activation. E-selectin binds to the carbohydrate ligand sialyl-Lewis (a). L-selectin is found on the surface of leukocytes and is released upon activation. L-selectin binds to the carbohydrate ligand sialyl-Lewis (a). The selectins mediate the initial steps of inflammation by binding to ligands on the surface of endothelial cells. The selectins mediate the rolling of leukocytes on the activated endothelium, a process that brings the leukocytes into contact with the endothelium. Rolling is followed by activation of the leukocyte, firm adhesion and extravasation of the leukocytes into the inflamed tissue. The selectins are also involved in other biological processes such as blood clotting and embryogenesis. The selectins are type I membrane proteins with an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain is composed of a lectin domain, a EGF-like domain and a mucin-like domain.

NK cells are distinct from T cells in their developmental origin and in their receptors they express. NK cells express a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors that regulate their activation. The inhibitory receptors include members of the immunoglobulin gene family and the C-type lectin-like CD9 4 / NKG2 family. The activating receptors include NKG2D, a member of the C-type lectin gene family, and the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) NKp-1, NKp-2, and NKp-3. The activating receptors are differentially expressed on NK cells and subsets of T cells and are differentially regulated. The expression of the activating receptors is regulated by cytokines and cellular stress. The activation of NK cells is regulated by a balance of signals from the activating and inhibitory receptors. The absence of inhibitory signals results in the activation of NK cells. The activation of NK cells leads to the secretion of perforin and granzyme to induce apoptosis of target cells and the release of cytokines that can stimulate the immune response. The activation of NK cells is regulated by a balance of signals from the activating and inhibitory receptors. The absence of inhibitory signals results in the activation of NK cells. The activation of NK cells is regulated by a balance of signals from the activating and inhibitory receptors.",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. It is released into the portal vessels in the hypothalamus and is transported to the anterior pituitary where it binds to receptors on the surface of the gonadotropes. The binding of GnRH to its receptor activates the phospholipase C pathway, which leads to the release of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C. The activation of protein kinase C stimulates the synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH. The activation of the phospholipase A2 pathway leads to the release of arachidonic acid, which is converted to the second messengers diacylglycerol and arachidonic acid. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway also stimulates the synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a key regulator of T cell development and activation. Engagement of the TCR induces activation of the small G-protein Ras, which activates the Raf-1 / MEK / ERK kinase cascade to regulate gene expression. The downstream targets of the ERK kinases include the transcription factor ELK-1, which regulates genes involved in T cell activation and proliferation. The diaphanous related formin (Dia) proteins are another group of Ras effectors that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. The Dia proteins are activated by binding of activated Rho to a Rho-binding domain (RBD) in the N-terminus of the Dia proteins. The Dia proteins nucleate actin polymerization and induce the formation of actin filaments that are oriented in a specific direction. The T cell receptor activates the Rho-family GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 to induce actin polymerization and reorganization. The Dia proteins are activated by binding of activated Rac and Cdc42 to a Rac-binding domain (RBD) in the N-terminus of the Dia proteins. The Dia proteins are required for actin polymerization and reorganization induced by the T cell receptor and the Rho-family GTPases. The Dia proteins are required for T cell development and activation. T cells from mice lacking the mDia1 gene are impaired in activation and development. The impaired activation of T cells lacking mDia1 may be due to the failure of T cells to respond to signals from the antigen presenting cell. The impaired development of T cells lacking mDia1 may be due to defects in T cell receptor signaling.",
  "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the proliferation of immature myeloid cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and blood. Multiple genetic alterations cooperate to deregulate normal hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation, leading to the development of AML. Mutations in three genes, nucleophosmin (NPM1), c-KIT and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), are the most frequent molecular alterations in AML. Other genes that are mutated in a small percentage of patients include CEBPA, RUNX1, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN1 1, and WT1.",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in early defense against viral infection and cellular transformation. NK cells do not express antigen receptors of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene family (e.g., Ig or T cell receptors), but express various activating and inhibitory receptors that recognize various ligands on target cells. Activating receptors include the Ig-like receptors (e.g., killer cell Ig-like receptors, KIRs) and the lectin-like receptors (e.g., CD9 4-NKG2 heterodimers). Inhibitory receptors include the Ig-like receptors (e.g., leukocyte Ig-like receptors, LIRs) and the MHC class I-specific inhibitory receptors (e.g., killer cell lectin-like receptor, KLRs). Engagement of activating receptors by their ligands induces NK cell activation, whereas engagement of inhibitory receptors by MHC class I inhibits NK cell activation. Upon activation, NK cells produce cytokines and chemokines, and induce the expression of cytotoxic proteins, such as perforin and granzyme B. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is triggered by the release of perforin and granzyme B from cytotoxic granules, which are then delivered to the surface of target cells.",
  "Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein that plays a key role in development of the central nervous system. In the developing cerebellum, Shh is secreted by Purkinje cells and acts on the granule cell precursors (GCPs) in the external layer of the cerebellum to stimulate their proliferation. Shh stimulates proliferation of GCPs by inducing expression of cyclin D1 and inhibiting expression of the cdk inhibitor, p2 7. The Shh pathway is also involved in the proliferation of cancer cells in basal cell carcinomas of the skin. The Shh receptor patched (ptc) is a tumor suppressor gene. Ptc inhibits the activity of Smoothened (Smo), a protein that transduces the Shh signal. Mutations in ptc that lead to constitutive activation of Smo cause basal cell carcinomas. The role of Shh in the development of other cancers may be related to its role in stimulating proliferation of stem cells in other tissues.",
  "The intestinal epithelium is a highly specialized tissue that serves as a selective barrier between the host and the luminal contents of the gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal epithelium is a simple columnar epithelium that is renewed every 3-5 days by the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal crypt cells. The intestinal epithelium is a dynamic tissue that undergoes rapid cell turnover and regeneration in response to injury. The integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier is regulated by a variety of factors, including the expression of tight junction proteins, the expression of cell adhesion molecules, and the expression of mucins. In addition to these structural components, the intestinal epithelium is home to a diverse array of microorganisms that play an important role in intestinal physiology and pathophysiology. The intestinal epithelium is in a constant state of inflammation, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an imbalance between proinflammatory mediators and anti-inflammatory factors. The intestinal epithelium is also the site of origin for a number of intestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer. The etiology of IBD and colorectal cancer is not well understood, but genetic factors are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders.",
  "The G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle is regulated by the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), cdk2 and cdk4, which are activated by association with cyclins. The cdk-cyclin complexes phosphorylate substrates that regulate the G1 to S phase transition. The cdk inhibitors, such as p16INK4a, inhibit the activity of the cdk-cyclin complexes.

The activity of the cdk-cyclin complexes is also regulated by association with other proteins. The E2F family of transcription factors are one of the substrates of the cdk-cyclin complexes. Phosphorylation of the E2Fs by the cdk-cyclin complexes results in the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of the E2Fs. The transcriptional activity of the E2Fs is required for the expression of genes required for S phase. The cdk inhibitor, p16INK4a, inhibits the phosphorylation of the E2Fs by the cdk-cyclin complexes. Association of the cdk inhibitor, p16INK4a, with cdk4 inhibits the phosphorylation of the Rb protein by the cdk4-cyclin D complex.

  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a highly conserved mechanism that removes a wide variety of structurally unrelated lesions from DNA. This repair mechanism involves the formation of a stable complex with damaged DNA, followed by the assembly of the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) or global genome repair (GGR) subpathways. TCR is a transcription-coupled repair pathway that rapidly removes DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. GGR repairs lesions throughout the genome. In GGR, XPC-hHR2 3B complex and UV-DDB are the damage recognition factors. After the recognition step, the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex and CSA and CSB are recruited to the damaged DNA. The RNA polymerase II complex is then dislodged, and the repair machinery including the DNA polymerases and DNA ligase I are recruited to the site of the lesion, leading to the formation of an incision around the lesion and the removal of a short fragment of DNA. The repair is completed by the repair synthesis and ligation.",
  "The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that defends against infection and defends against cancer cells. The immune system is composed of two parts, the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against infection and includes macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and the complement system. The adaptive immune system is comprised of B cells that produce antibodies and T cells that respond by proliferation and clonal expansion. The adaptive immune system is antigen specific and requires time to develop and respond to infection. Macrophages, NK cells, and the complement system recognize and destroy foreign cells and molecules. The adaptive immune system responds to infection and cancer cells by producing antigen-specific B and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that bind to and destroy specific antigens. T cells respond to specific antigens by proliferating and proliferating and producing effector cells such as helper T cells that provide help for B cells and cytotoxic T cells that kill specific cells. The adaptive immune system is divided into two types, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted T cell response and the MHC-unrestricted response. MHC-restricted T cells respond to antigens presented by MHC molecules on the surface of cells. MHC-unrestricted T cells respond to antigens that are not presented by MHC molecules. The MHC-restricted T cell response is the basis of the response to most foreign antigens and is the basis of the response to cancer cells. The MHC-unrestricted T cell response is important for the response to infection with intracellular pathogens such as viruses. B cells produce antibodies that bind to and neutralize specific foreign antigens. The B cell receptor (BCR) is a membrane protein that binds to the antigen and presents it to T cells. The BCR also signals the B cell to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells or memory cells.",
  "The LPA2 receptor is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family. It is activated by the lipid mediator LPA and couples to the Gi / o family of G proteins. The LPA2 receptor is widely expressed in the brain and is involved in neuronal migration during development. The LPA2 receptor also couples to the Rho signaling pathway to regulate cytoskeletal changes and cell motility. The LPA2 receptor is involved in the progression of cancer and heart disease.",
  "Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates cell fate decisions in a variety of systems. In mammals, Notch signaling is mediated by four Notch receptors (Notch1-Notch4) and five Delta-like ligands (Dll1, Dll3, and Dll4). Signaling is initiated by the interaction of the DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag-2) domain of the Notch receptor with a DSL ligand expressed on an adjacent cell. This interaction leads to two proteolytic cleavages of the Notch receptor. The first cleavage is mediated by a metalloprotease, tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), and occurs in the extracellular domain. The second cleavage occurs within the transmembrane domain and is mediated by gamma-secretase. Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released from the membrane and translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with the DNA binding protein CSL (CBF1 / Su (H) / Lag-1) and a transcriptional coactivator, Mastermind. CSL is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that represses transcription in the absence of NICD. Interaction of NICD with CSL converts the CSL complex from a repressor to an activator. NICD also interacts with the kinase p38, which may phosphorylate factors involved in transcriptional activation. NICD also interacts with the adaptor protein Shc, which may activate the Ras / Map kinase pathway. In addition to regulating cell fate decisions, Notch signaling has been implicated in other cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.",
  "The signal transduction cascade of long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of learning and memory, is thought to be involved in learning and memory. The activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate leads to the influx of calcium ions into the postsynaptic neuron. The increase in intracellular calcium activates CaM kinase II, which in turn phosphorylates AMPA receptors, resulting in an increase in the number of AMPA receptors at the synapse. The phosphorylation of AMPA receptors by CaM kinase II also increases the channel open probability of the receptor. The phosphorylation of AMPA receptors by CaM kinase II also increases the response of the receptor to glutamate. The activation of NMDA receptors also activates the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The increase in intracellular calcium activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which produces nitric oxide (NO). NO activates guanylate cyclase, which produces cGMP, activating protein kinase G. The activation of protein kinase G increases the insertion of AMPA receptors into the synapse, resulting in an increase in the number of AMPA receptors at the synapse. This cascade may be involved in learning and memory.",
  "The B cell receptor (BCR) complex is a key component of the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is a heterodimer of immunoglobulin (Ig) and Ig-alpha / Ig-beta. Ig-alpha / Ig-beta is associated with the protein tyrosine kinases LYN, SYK, and BLNK. The BCR is activated by binding of antigen to the Ig. The BCR activates a variety of signaling pathways, including the Ras / Map kinase pathway, the PLCgamma pathway, and the NFAT pathway.",
  "Eosinophils are leukocytes that are involved in inflammatory responses. Eosinophils are also involved in the development of allergic responses. Eosinophils are found in the blood and tissues of healthy individuals at very low levels. In response to inflammatory stimuli, such as allergens, eosinophils are recruited to the tissues and activated to release toxic granules that damage tissues. In addition to their role in inflammation, eosinophils are involved in the regulation of immune responses. Eosinophils express the high affinity IgE receptor (FcER1) and secrete a number of cytokines and chemokines that can affect immune responses.",
  "Spliceosomes are macromolecular complexes that catalyze the excision of introns from pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and joining of the exons in a process called splicing. The spliceosome is a complex of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and many spliceosome-associated factors (SAPs). The spliceosome is highly dynamic and undergoes dramatic compositional and structural rearrangements during the splicing reaction. Spliceosome assembly begins with the recognition of the 5 'splice site by the U1 snRNP, followed by the recognition of the 3' splice site by the U2 snRNP. The U4 / U6.U5 tri-snRNP is then recruited to the spliceosome and the splicing reaction proceeds. After splicing, the spliceosome is disassembled and the components are recycled for additional splicing rounds.",
  "DNA replication is a fundamental biological process that occurs in all organisms and that is carried out by a highly conserved set of proteins. In eukaryotic cells, DNA replication takes place at multiple sites in the genome, known as replication origins, and is carried out by a DNA replication complex known as the replisome. The replisome consists of a DNA helicase (MCM complex), a DNA polymerase (pol delta or pol epsilon), an RPA complex, and a DNA primase. The DNA helicase moves along the DNA helix and unwinds the DNA duplex to form the replication fork. The DNA polymerase and the primase enzymes then work together to synthesize DNA on the leading and lagging DNA strands. The DNA helicase activity of the MCM complex is activated by the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which loads the PCNA clamp onto the DNA. The DNA polymerase and the primase are then loaded onto the DNA by the RPA complex. The DNA helicase activity of the MCM complex is also stimulated by the replication protein A (RPA). The DNA polymerase and the primase are then activated by the replication factor C (RFC) complex. The DNA helicase activity of the MCM complex is also stimulated by the replication protein A (RPA). The DNA polymerase and the primase are then recycled to synthesize new DNA.",
  "The coagulation cascade is a series of enzymatic reactions that leads to the formation of a clot from soluble plasma proteins. The activation of prothrombin by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex is the point of convergence for all the clotting pathways. The activation of prothrombin by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex is enhanced by the presence of factor Va, a membrane-bound protein. The activation of prothrombin by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The activation of factor X by factor Xa is inhibited by antithrombin III (AT-III) and protein C (PC). The activation of factor V by thrombin is inhibited by PC and the protein S (PS) complex. The activation of factor XI by factor XII is inhibited by C1 inhibitor (C1I). The activation of fibrinogen by thrombin is inhibited by AT-III and thrombomodulin (TM).",
  "The protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR2 are cleaved by proteases such as thrombin to reveal a tethered peptide ligand that binds to and activates the receptor. The tethered ligand is not a full agonist, but rather a cofactor that increases the affinity of the receptor for its ligand. The tethered ligand is not exposed by protease cleavage of PAR1 in the absence of thrombin. The tethered ligand peptide binds exosite I on the receptor to stabilize the active conformation of the receptor. The binding of the tethered ligand peptide to the receptor activates PAR1 signaling. The cleaved receptor is rapidly phosphorylated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (PRK), resulting in internalization of the receptor. The activation of PAR1 by the tethered ligand peptide is irreversible. PAR2 is activated by trypsin and by trypsin-like proteases such as tryptase. The cleavage of PAR2 by trypsin reveals a tethered ligand that activates PAR2. The tethered ligand is not a full agonist, but is a cofactor that increases the affinity of the receptor for its ligand. The activation of PAR2 by the tethered ligand peptide is reversible. PAR2 is rapidly internalized following activation by trypsin, but PAR2 signaling is not turned off. PAR2 is also a coreceptor for the activation of the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) by trypsin. Activation of PAR2 by trypsin or synthetic peptide ligands causes the dissociation of beta-gamma subunits of G proteins and the activation of a G protein-independent signaling pathway. The G protein-independent signaling pathway involves the activation of the small G protein RhoA and the subsequent activation of Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK). ROCK activation by trypsin or peptide ligand causes myosin phosphorylation and contraction of actin-myosin filaments. This pathway may be involved in the inflammatory response to trypsin.",
  "The CD4 0 receptor is a member of the TNF receptor family that is expressed on B cells and activated monocytes. The ligand for the CD4 0 receptor is the CD40 ligand (CD4 0L), also known as CD1 5 4. The interaction of CD4 0 and CD4 0L is involved in the regulation of B cell activation and proliferation, as well as the regulation of cytokine production by T cells. Blocking the interaction of CD4 0 and CD4 0L with blocking antibodies or soluble CD4 0L can prevent graft rejection and the development of autoimmune disorders. The interaction of CD4 0L with CD4 0 also plays a role in the activation of platelets and the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Blocking the interaction of CD4 0L and CD4 0 may be useful in the treatment of thrombosis and atherosclerosis. The interaction of CD4 0L with CD4 0 activates several signaling pathways, including the NF-kB pathway. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L is dependent on the TRAF family of proteins, which interact with the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 0L. TRAF-2 and TRAF-3 interact with the CD4 0L cytoplasmic domain and are required for the activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the activity of the kinase NIK and the kinase TAK1. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the kinase Tpl2, but does not require the kinase MEKK1. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the kinase NIK. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the activity of the phosphatase PP2A. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the activity of the kinase PKN1. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the activity of the protein phosphatase PP2A. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the activity of the kinase TAK1. The activation of NF-kB by CD4 0L also requires the activity of the phosphatase PP2A.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway for the repair of DNA damage caused by alkylation, oxidation, and deamination. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases that recognize and excise the damaged base, generating an apurinic / apyrimidinic (AP) site. AP sites are then incised by apurinic / apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1), which is stimulated by the base excision repair (BER) protein X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1). The resulting gap is filled by DNA polymerase (pol) beta, and ligation by DNA ligase (Lig) III or Lig I. Alternatively, in short-patch BER, pol delta or pol epsilon may substitute for pol beta. DNA glycosylases are classified into two groups: monofunctional glycosylases, which remove only the damaged base, and bifunctional glycosylases, which catalyze both the excision of the damaged base and the incision of the DNA backbone. E. coli AlkA and human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (hAAG) are monofunctional DNA glycosylases. E. coli Nth and human NTH1 are monofunctional DNA glycosylases. E. coli Nei and human NEIL1 and NEIL2 are bifunctional DNA glycosylases.",
  "The recruitment of leukocytes from the blood to sites of inflammation is a key component of the immune response. The selectin family of adhesion molecules are expressed on the surface of leukocytes and mediate their initial interactions with the endothelium and the underlying extracellular matrix at the site of inflammation. The selectins bind to ligands in the extracellular matrix and on the endothelium that are modified by the enzyme, neuraminidase. The selectins are rapidly shed from the cell surface following activation of the cell, and their soluble forms are found in the plasma. The selectins are also involved in the activation of leukocytes and their subsequent migration into the tissue. Selectin-mediated interactions are important in the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation during infection, but may also be involved in other inflammatory responses and in the metastasis of tumor cells.",
  "The basement membrane is a specialized extracellular matrix that underlies and supports all epithelial and endothelial cells in animals. Basement membranes are thin, dense sheets of extracellular matrix that are important for tissue structure and function. Basement membranes are also involved in many cellular processes including cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Basement membranes are composed of several distinct macromolecules including collagen IV, laminin, entactin, and agrin. The major structural component of basement membranes is collagen IV, a heterotrimer composed of two alpha chains (I-IV) and one beta chain (IV). The alpha chains of collagen IV are encoded by four different genes (Col4a1-4a3). The alpha chains of collagen IV are post-translationally modified by the addition of hydroxylysyl and lysyl residues, and the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. The formation of disulfide bonds between alpha chains is critical for the assembly of collagen IV into a basement membrane. The alpha chains of collagen IV are covalently linked by a network of disulfide bonds to form a network of fibers that is important for the structural integrity of basement membranes. The alpha chains of collagen IV are non-collagenous and are covalently linked by a network of disulfide bonds to form a network of fibers that is important for the structural integrity of basement membranes. Laminin is a heterotrimeric protein that is a major component of basement membranes. Laminin is a large glycoprotein that is composed of three different subunits (A, B1, and B2). The A and B1 subunits are similar in size, but the B2 subunit is much smaller. The A and B1 subunits are covalently linked by disulfide bonds, but the A and B2 subunits are not covalently linked. Agrin is a proteoglycan that is also a component of basement membranes. Agrin is a large proteoglycan that is covalently linked to the core protein of laminin by the same mechanisms that link laminin to collagen IV. The formation of disulfide bonds between alpha chains of collagen IV and the formation of disulfide bonds between alpha chains of collagen IV and laminin are critical steps in the assembly of a basement membrane. The formation of disulfide bonds between alpha chains of collagen IV and the formation of disulfide bonds between alpha chains of laminin are critical steps in the assembly of a basement membrane. The formation of disulfide bonds between alpha chains of collagen IV and the formation of disulfide bonds between alpha chains of laminin are critical steps in the assembly of a basement membrane.",
  "The snail family of transcriptional repressors has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), a process by which polarized epithelial cells are converted to migratory, mesenchymal cells. The EMT is thought to be involved in normal development, such as the formation of the mesoderm during development of the embryo, and also in pathological processes, such as the formation of tumor metastases. The EMT is characterized by the loss of epithelial cell polarity and cell-cell adhesions, and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype, including the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and increased motility. The EMT is also associated with the loss of expression of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, and the acquisition of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin. The Snail family of transcriptional repressors includes Snail, Slug, and Smuc. Snail and Slug repress transcription of E-cadherin, a key component of epithelial cell adhesion molecules. Snail and Slug also repress the expression of occludin, a component of tight junctions. Snail and Slug repress the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of extracellular matrix, such as collagen type I and fibronectin. Snail also represses the expression of genes involved in the formation of cell-substratum adhesions, such as integrin alpha5 and focal adhesion kinase. Snail represses transcription of the estrogen receptor, a key regulator of mammary epithelial cell differentiation. The estrogen receptor represses the expression of the EMT-inducing transcription factor Twist. The estrogen receptor also represses the expression of the metastasis-associated gene S1 0 0A4, also known as p9ka. The estrogen receptor also represses the expression of cathepsin D, a protease involved in extracellular matrix degradation. The estrogen receptor represses the expression of the metastasis suppressor gene nm2 3. The expression of nm2 3 is associated with a more favorable prognosis in breast cancer patients. The estrogen receptor represses the expression of cathepsin D, a protease involved in extracellular matrix degradation. The estrogen receptor also represses the expression of the metastasis-associated gene S1 0 0A4. The estrogen receptor represses the expression of the gene encoding heat shock protein 1B. hsp15 is a component of the steroid hormone receptor chaperone complex. The expression of hsp15 is repressed by the estrogen receptor.",
  "The second messenger cAMP is involved in a variety of cellular responses, including the regulation of smooth muscle tone. The action of cAMP is mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac. The activation of PKA by cAMP leads to relaxation of smooth muscle. The activation of Epac by cAMP leads to the activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to generate IP3 and DAG. IP3 induces the release of calcium from intracellular stores, whereas DAG activates PKC. The activation of PKC leads to the phosphorylation of a variety of targets, including the inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase, which leads to an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation and smooth muscle contraction. The activation of Epac also leads to the activation of the small G protein Rap1, which may also contribute to smooth muscle contraction. The activation of Epac by cAMP may also lead to the activation of the MAPK pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of ERK and other downstream targets.",
  "Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of detoxifying and antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a member of the Cap'n'Collar family of transcription factors and is structurally related to Nrf1, Nrf3 and CEBP. Nrf2 is localized in the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to the protein Keap1. Oxidative stress, electrophiles, and other forms of stress disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, allowing Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus and form a complex with the transcription factor keap1. Nrf2-Keap1 complex binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant genes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GST), NAD (P) H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS). Nrf2-deficient mice are more susceptible to oxidative stress and inflammation, and are deficient in the induction of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes.",
  "The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PAMPs are specific molecular motifs that are present in invading pathogens but are absent from the host. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-characterized PRRs. TLRs are expressed on the cell surface or in endosomal compartments and recognize extracellular PAMPs, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycans, and lipoproteins, or intracellular PAMPs, such as bacterial nucleic acids. Upon recognition of PAMPs, TLRs recruit adaptor proteins and initiate signaling cascades, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). The adaptor proteins that are involved in TLR signaling include myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 8 8 (MyD8 8), Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF), TIR-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-beta (TICAM), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). These adaptors activate distinct signaling pathways and induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. Inflammasomes are another class of PRRs that recognize intracellular PAMPs. The inflammasome is a large protein complex that activates caspase-1, which leads to the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1 8. Inflammasome activation also induces pyroptosis, a form of cell death. Several inflammasomes have been identified, including the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is activated by a variety of stimuli, including bacterial toxins, ATP, and particulate matter. The AIM2 inflammasome is activated by DNA viruses and intracellular bacteria. The activation of inflammasomes requires two signals: the first signal is provided by priming of the inflammasome through TLRs, which induces the expression of the inactive precursor forms of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1 8. The second signal is provided by the recognition of PAMPs or danger signals by inflammasomes. The activation of inflammasomes also leads to pyroptosis.",
  "Leptin is a peptide hormone that regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin binds to a receptor in the hypothalamus to regulate food intake and metabolism. Leptin acts to increase the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus. AMPK is a metabolic sensor that is activated by increases in the AMP: ATP ratio. Leptin activates AMPK by increasing the AMP: ATP ratio and also by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK by the serine threonine kinase, LKB1. Leptin also activates the kinase Akt, which phosphorylates and activates the kinase CaMKKbeta, which activates AMPK by increasing the AMP: ATP ratio. CaMKKbeta is also activated by increases in intracellular calcium, and this pathway may also contribute to the activation of AMPK by leptin. AMPK activation by leptin inhibits food intake and increases energy expenditure by increasing the activity of the enzyme ACC. ACC is inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation and activated by the product of ACC, malonyl-CoA. ACC catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of fatty acids. Malonyl-CoA is an important precursor for the synthesis of fatty acids and a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of ACC by AMPK activation increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases fatty acid synthesis, contributing to the regulation of energy metabolism by leptin. Leptin also activates AMPK in the liver to inhibit fatty acid synthesis and increase fatty acid oxidation, contributing to the regulation of energy metabolism by leptin in multiple tissues.",
  "Sodium reabsorption by the renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT) plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure. Sodium is reabsorbed from the renal filtrate primarily via the sodium channel ENaC in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN). The mineralocorticoid aldosterone stimulates sodium reabsorption in the ASDN by increasing the number of active sodium channels at the apical membrane of the DCT and connecting tubule (CNT) cells. Aldosterone acts via mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), which are ligand-dependent transcription factors. In the absence of aldosterone, MR is retained in the cytoplasm bound to heat shock protein 9 0 (HSP9 0) and the immunophilin FK5 0 6-binding protein 5 2 (FKBP5 2). Binding of aldosterone to MR causes dissociation of HSP9 0 and FKBP5 2, and translocation of the MR-ligand complex to the nucleus. In the nucleus, MR interacts with members of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family of transcriptional coactivators, which interact with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to increase histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility. The MR-SRC complex interacts with the transcription factor AP-1, which binds to the Scnn1subunit of ENaC. Increased histone acetylation and recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery result in increased ENaC expression and activity. In addition to regulation by aldosterone, ENaC activity is also regulated by the serine-threonine kinase WNK4. WNK4 inhibits ENaC activity by decreasing the number of channels at the apical membrane. Mutations in the gene encoding for WNK4 (WNK4 (D5 6 8NG)) found in patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) result in a loss of inhibition of ENaC by WNK4, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and hypertension.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit protein complex that is expressed on the surface of mature T cells and is responsible for antigen-specific recognition of foreign peptides bound to MHC molecules by the T cell. The TCR is a heterodimer of two subunits, the clonotypic TCRalpha and TCRbeta chains and the CD3 complex. The CD3 complex is made up of CD3gamma, CD3delta, CD3epsilon and CD24. The TCR / CD3 complex is associated with the tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn that are responsible for the initial TCR phosphorylation. The activation of T cells is dependent on the engagement of the TCR by the MHC-peptide complex and the costimulatory molecule CD2 8. Engagement of the TCR alone is insufficient to induce T cell activation, but it is necessary to induce the phosphorylation of LAT and the subsequent activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the calcium pathway.",
  "Serine is an essential amino acid that animals cannot synthesize. Serine is derived from carbohydrates, glycine and methionine. Serine is an important component of proteins and is involved in many metabolic pathways. Serine is also a precursor of glycine. Serine is synthesized from 3-phospho-D-glycerate in a reaction catalyzed by phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT). Phosphoserine is converted to glycine in a reaction catalyzed by phosphoserine aminotransferase and phosphoserine phosphatase. Choline is an essential nutrient that cannot be synthesized by animals. Choline is an important methyl group donor in one-carbon metabolism. One-carbon metabolism involves the transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine to regenerate methionine. The methyl group is derived from dietary choline. Methionine is also an essential amino acid. The conversion of homocysteine to methionine is a key step in the metabolism of methionine. The remethylation of homocysteine to methionine requires vitamin B1 2 and folate. Vitamin B1 2 is derived from meat and liver. Folate is found in plants and in some foods. Intakes of folate are influenced by dietary intake and intestinal absorption. Intakes of vitamin B6 and vitamin B1 2 are influenced by intestinal absorption. Pyridoxal phosphate is an essential cofactor in the metabolism of vitamin A. Pyridoxal phosphate is synthesized from vitamin B6.",
  "The complement system is a key part of the innate immune system, and is activated by a variety of stimuli, including the presence of pathogens. The classical pathway of complement activation is triggered by the presence of antibody-coated pathogens, while the alternative pathway is activated in the absence of antibodies. The lectin pathway is triggered by the direct binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to microbial surfaces. The pentraxin family of proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP) and pentraxin 3 (pentraxin 3), are also pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) that bind to a variety of ligands. The activation of complement leads to the lysis of the pathogen and the recruitment of inflammatory cells.",
  "Eph receptors are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by their ligands, ephrins, and are involved in cell-cell interactions. Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in the developing nervous system and are involved in axon guidance. In addition, ephrins and Eph receptors are expressed in the vasculature and may play a role in angiogenesis. The ephrin ligands are also expressed in the vasculature and may play a role in angiogenesis. Eph receptors and ephrins are also expressed in some tumor cells and may play a role in tumor angiogenesis. The ephrin ligands are also cleaved from the cell surface and released into the extracellular space. The soluble ephrins can bind to Eph receptors on other cells and may play a role in cell-cell interactions in the developing nervous system and vasculature. The Eph receptors and ephrins are also expressed in the immune system and may play a role in the immune system. The signaling pathways downstream of Eph receptors and ephrins are not well understood. One pathway downstream of Eph receptors involves phosphorylation of the Src family of tyrosine kinases and the ras-related protein Rap1. Another pathway involves phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the formation of complexes between FAK, Src, and the adaptor protein paxillin. Activation of Eph receptors and ephrins may also play a role in cell adhesion.",
  "Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is induced by a variety of stimuli, including viral infection, growth factor withdrawal, and cytotoxic drugs. The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays a key role in the execution phase of apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates apoptosis by controlling the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) / Akt signaling pathway inhibits apoptosis by blocking the release of cytochrome c and other apoptotic factors from mitochondria. The adenovirus E1B1 9K protein binds to the Bcl-2 family member Bax and blocks Bax-induced apoptosis. The adenovirus E1B1 9K protein also binds to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and blocks the presentation of viral antigens by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Macrophages and neutrophils are the two major cell types involved in the innate immune response. Macrophages phagocytose and destroy bacteria, fungi and parasites. Neutrophils are the first cells to respond to infection and are involved in the inflammatory response through the release of reactive oxygen species and proteases. Macrophages and neutrophils also secrete cytokines that activate other cells of the immune system, including T cells. Macrophages and neutrophils are activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR4 is activated by LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipoproteins, and TLR6 is activated by bacterial tripalmitoyl-glycerol (Pam3Cys). LPS is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is a potent activator of macrophages and neutrophils. TLR2 and TLR6 are also activated by bacterial lipoproteins. Bacterial lipoproteins are released from bacteria during lysis and are found in the plasma of infected animals. Macrophages and neutrophils express TLR2 and TLR6, but not TLR4, and are activated by bacterial lipoproteins. Macrophages and neutrophils also express the receptor for LPS, TLR4. TLR4 is activated by LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and also by endogenous ligands such as heat shock proteins and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Macrophages and neutrophils also express the integrin CD1 8, which is required for activation of these cells by LPS. Binding of LPS to TLR4 activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which induces the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response. In addition to activating macrophages and neutrophils, LPS also induces the expression of chemokines such as IL-8, which recruit other cells to the site of infection. The expression of chemokines and other inflammatory genes by LPS is inhibited by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).",
  "The cell cycle is a highly coordinated sequence of events that occurs in a cell's main role, duplicating its DNA and preparing it for division. The cell cycle is regulated by a group of proteins called cyclins, which are expressed at specific times in the cell cycle and are degraded at the end of that phase. The cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) are a group of proteins that are activated by binding to the cyclins and phosphorylate other proteins to allow the cell to progress through the cycle. The CDKs are regulated by a group of proteins called CDK inhibitors. When the CDK inhibitor is bound to the CDK, the CDK is not active. The CDK inhibitor proteins include p16INK4a, p18INK4c, p15INK4b and p27KIP1. When a cell is ready to divide, the cyclin E protein is expressed and the cell cycle is started. The cyclin E / CDK2 complex phosphorylates the p16INK4a and p18INK4c proteins, causing them to be degraded. The degradation of the p16INK4a and p18INK4c proteins allows the cell cycle to progress. The cyclin E / CDK2 complex also activates the p15INK4b and p27KIP1 proteins, which inhibit the cell cycle further. The p15INK4b and p27KIP1 proteins inhibit the activity of the CDK activator, p34, which activates the cell cycle genes. The CDK inhibitor, p53, also inhibits the cell cycle when it is activated by DNA damage. If the DNA is damaged, p53 is activated and causes the cell to either repair the damage or undergo apoptosis. If the damage is too great, the cell may undergo apoptosis. The p53 protein is activated by two different pathways. One pathway activates p53 by causing it to form a complex with the protein, p209. The p209 protein is activated by the ATM protein, a kinase that is activated by DNA damage. The other p53 pathway activates p53 by causing it to form a complex with the protein, p90RSK. The p53 / p90RSK complex then activates the p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 CDK inhibitors, which inhibit the cell cycle. If the damage is too great, the p53 / p90RSK complex may activate the apoptotic pathway.",
  "The liver plays a central role in lipid metabolism by converting dietary carbohydrates into triglycerides that are packaged into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and secreted from the liver. Triglycerides are packaged into VLDL in the liver and secreted into the blood bound to apolipoprotein B (ApoB). The triglycerides are hydrolyzed in the circulation by lipoprotein lipase to free fatty acids and glycerol. The fatty acids are taken up by tissues and oxidized to produce energy or converted to triglycerides for storage. The liver also plays a key role in the metabolism of cholesterol, converting it from a precursor in the diet into bile acids. The conversion of cholesterol to bile acids takes place in the liver and is the major pathway for eliminating cholesterol from the body. The liver also plays a key role in the conversion of provitamin A into vitamin A. The liver stores vitamin A as a complex with proteins called provitamin A carotenoids. The liver enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of provitamin A to vitamin A is called provitamin A-9-cis-oxygenase (PTAOx).",
  "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-beta superfamily of growth and differentiation factors that are involved in a variety of developmental processes including skeletogenesis, neurogenesis, and mesoderm formation. BMPs are secreted as latent precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. The active BMP dimer binds to two types of transmembrane serine / threonine kinase receptors. The type II receptor recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates downstream signaling molecules, the SMADs. Phosphorylated SMADs (pSMADs) then associate with the co-SMAD, SMAD4, and the pSMAD-SMAD4 complex translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, pSMADs regulate transcription of target genes by interacting with specific DNA-binding transcription factors and / or coactivators.",
  "The electron transport chain (ETC) is the main source of cellular energy in aerobic organisms. It transfers electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen to produce water. The ETC consists of five large multi-subunit protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The complexes are named I-V. Complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the entry point of electrons into the ETC. It is composed of 4 5 different subunits and contains a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a prosthetic group. Complex I transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Electrons from ubiquinone are passed to a series of iron-sulfur clusters and then to ubiquinone. Ubiquinol is then oxidized by complex III (ubiquinone: cytochrome c oxidoreductase) to cytochrome c. Complex III transfers electrons from ubiquinone to cytochrome c. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) transfers electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor for the ETC. The energy released by the transfer of electrons through the ETC is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. This creates a proton gradient that is used by complex V (ATP synthase) to generate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. In addition to generating ATP, the ETC also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product of electron transport. At low levels, ROS act as signaling molecules, but at higher levels they can damage cellular components. Complex I is a major source of ROS in the mitochondria. ROS are produced by the transfer of an electron from FMN to molecular oxygen. The FMN is highly reactive and can react with oxygen to produce superoxide. Superoxide is converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD). H2O2 is further converted to water by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) or catalase (CAT). < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > \u2583 < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > The ETC is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria.

  "The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. In the absence of a stimulus, NF-kappaB is retained in the cytoplasm by association with IkappaB. The IKK complex phosphorylates IkappaBand targets it for degradation by the proteasome. The IKK complex is activated by phosphorylation by the TRAF family of proteins that associate with the TNF receptor.",
  "Insulin stimulates skeletal muscle glucose uptake through the insulin receptor and the IRS-1 / PI3K / AKT pathway. AKT phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3, leading to an increase in glycogen synthase activity. AKT also phosphorylates and inhibits TSC2, releasing the ras-activation of raf1 (Rheb) to activate the mTOR / Raptor complex. Rheb activates the kinase activity of mTOR, which in turn activates p70S6K and 4EBP-1. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP-1 relieves their inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF-4E. eIF-4E then binds to the 5 '-cap structure of mRNA, recruiting other factors to the mRNA and forming the preinitiation complex. The net result is an increase in protein synthesis.",
  "The angiogenic process is a complex cascade of events that includes endothelial cell activation, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The angiogenic growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of this process. VEGF is secreted by a variety of cells in response to hypoxia, oncogenes, and other stimuli. VEGF binds to its receptor on endothelial cells and activates several signaling pathways, including the RAS / MAPK pathway, the PI3 kinase / AKT pathway, and the PKC pathway. These pathways converge on the transcription factor E2F, which induces the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and angiogenesis.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the major DNA repair pathway for the removal of small base lesions from DNA. BER is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that recognizes and excises the damaged base, generating an apurinic / apyrimidinic (AP) site. AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) incises the DNA at the AP site, creating a single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA). DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) and the DNA sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) recruit and activate DNA ligase III (LIG1) to seal the DNA. In addition to APE1, other DNA glycosylases are involved in the BER pathway. Glycosylases that act on oxidized bases include 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), Nei-like DNA glycosylase 1 (NEIL1), and Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2). Glycosylases that act on alkylated bases include alkylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG) and methyl-CpG binding domain 4 (MBD4). DNA glycosylases that act on oxidized and alkylated bases are grouped into two classes: monofunctional glycosylases that catalyze the excision of the damaged base and generate an AP site, and bifunctional glycosylases that catalyze the cleavage of the DNA backbone via an N-glycosylase activity and a \u03b2-lyase activity. Monofunctional glycosylases cleave the N-glycosylic bond of the damaged base, generating an AP site and an aldehyde. The AP site is then cleaved by an AP endonuclease, and the resulting DNA gap is filled by a DNA polymerase and ligated. bifunctional glycosylases catalyze the cleavage of the DNA backbone via a \u03b2-elimination or a dRP (deoxyribose phosphate) lyase mechanism. In the \u03b2-elimination reaction, the 3 '-phospho group of the deoxyribose is removed, and the 3' -deoxyribose is cleaved by the lyase activity of the glycosylase. In the dRP lyase reaction, the 3 '-phosphate is removed, and the 5' -deoxyribose is cleaved by the lyase activity of the glycosylase.",
  "Heart development is a complex process that requires the coordinated action of multiple signaling pathways. The heart forms from two distinct cell types, the cardiac mesoderm and the pharyngeal mesoderm. Cardiac mesoderm is induced by signals from the pharyngeal mesoderm, and subsequently differentiates into the cardiac tube, the first morphological sign of heart formation. The cardiac tube then undergoes looping to form the primitive heart. The cardiac cushion then forms by an epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of the cardiac mesoderm, and is essential for proper septation and valve formation. The cardiac cushions undergo remodeling and growth to form the semilunar valves and the membranous septa. The proper development of these structures is essential for the normal function of the heart. Defects in cardiac development can lead to congenital heart defects, a common form of birth defects. The signaling pathways that regulate heart formation have been identified through the study of mice with mutations in specific genes. The Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in cardiac development. Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that bind to cell surface receptors to transduce signals intracellularly. Wnt signaling is required for cardiac mesoderm induction and cardiac tube formation. Cardiac neural crest cells also contribute to the formation of the heart. Mutations in the transcription factor Tbx5 cause Holt-Oram syndrome, a condition that includes congenital heart defects. Tbx5 is required for the development of the cardiac ventricles and the proximal outflow tract. Mutations in the transcription factor Nkx2-5 cause human heart defects that include defects in atrial and ventricular septation. Nkx2-5 is required for proper cardiac morphogenesis and chamber formation. The transcription factor GATA-4 is required for proper cardiac morphogenesis and regulates the expression of other transcription factors including Tbx5 and Nkx2-5.",
  "The initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is a complex process involving more than a dozen initiation factors. The binding of the Met-tRNA (i) to the ribosome is the first step in the initiation of protein synthesis. The binding of the Met-tRNA (i) to the ribosome is stimulated by eIF-3. eIF-3 is a complex of polypeptides that is made up of three sub-complexes, 3 0k, 5 0k and 12k. The binding of eIF-2 to the ribosome is also stimulated by eIF-3. The binding of eIF-2 to the ribosome stimulates the binding of eIF-1 and eIF-5 to the ribosome. The hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF-2 is also a key regulatory step in the initiation of protein synthesis. The hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF-2 is stimulated by eIF-5. The hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF-2 is also stimulated by eIF-3. The release of eIF-6 from the ribosome is also a key regulatory step in the initiation of protein synthesis. The binding of eIF-6 to the 6 0S subunit promotes the joining of the 6 0S and 4 0S subunits to form the 8 0S initiation complex.",
  "The T cell receptor recognizes specific antigens in the context of MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells. The CD28 co-receptor is required for T cell activation. The CD28 co-receptor is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis in T cells. The CD28 co-receptor is associated with the protein kinase Lck and is required for Lck to phosphorylate the adaptor protein LAT. Phosphorylated LAT recruits other signaling molecules to the LAT complex, including the protein tyrosine kinases ZAP7 0 and Tec. The CD28 co-receptor also regulates the expression of the Fas ligand, a key mediator of T cell apoptosis. The CD28 co-receptor also regulates the expression of the T cell receptor itself. The CD3 complex is required for the cell surface expression of the T cell receptor. The CD3 complex is also required for the expression of the CD28 co-receptor. The regulation of T cell apoptosis and T cell receptor expression by the CD28 co-receptor is important for the maintenance of self-tolerance and the regulation of the immune response.",
  "The vertebrate heart is a complex organ with multiple functions. The contractile function of the heart is the most obvious, but it is not surprising that the heart also requires a large number of non-contractile proteins. The non-contractile proteins include structural proteins, enzymes, and signaling molecules. The non-contractile structural proteins include myosin, actin, troponins, desmin, titin, and alpha-actinin. The enzymes include creatine kinase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The signaling molecules include nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase C, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases. The non-contractile structural and signaling proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are transported to the nucleus to carry out their functions. The transport of these proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is mediated by nuclear localization signals (NLSs). The NLSs are short stretches of basic amino acids that are recognized by a family of nuclear transport receptors called importins. The importin-NLS interaction is regulated by the Ran GTPase. When Ran is GDP-bound, the importins bind to the NLSs and the proteins are transported into the nucleus. When Ran is GTP-bound, the importins release the proteins and the proteins are returned to the cytoplasm. The nuclear transport of these proteins is a highly regulated process. The regulation of the nuclear transport of these proteins is not well understood. However, it appears that phosphorylation plays a role in the regulation of the nuclear transport of these proteins. The phosphorylation of these proteins may change their conformation, increase their affinity for importins, or disrupt the interaction between the importins and the nucleoporins in the nuclear pore complex.",
  "Type I hypersensitivity reactions are antibody-dependent responses in which antigen-antibody complexes activate complement and macrophages. Macrophages and mast cells release histamine and other vasoactive amines, causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. The activation of basophils and eosinophils also contributes to the symptoms of Type I hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells and basophils express high levels of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) and are activated by antigen-antibody complexes. Mast cells and basophils also release cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and TNF-alpha that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of B cells and the production of IgE antibodies. Eosinophils are activated by IL-5 released from basophils and other cells. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are important in the immune response to parasites and allergens, but can also cause tissue damage in the case of allergens.",
  "Leukocyte migration plays a central role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation, immune surveillance, host defense, and the development of the immune system. Leukocyte migration is a multistep process that includes rolling, activation, firm adhesion, and diapedesis. During the first step of leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction, the selectin family of adhesion molecules mediates the initial capture of leukocytes. After rolling, leukocytes are activated by chemokines and other inflammatory signals, and then transmigrate through the intercellular junctions of the vascular endothelium. During this process, leukocytes first interact with endothelial adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and then with the tight junction protein occludin. During diapedesis, leukocytes interact with endothelial junctional complexes through PECAM-1 and other junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs).",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a highly conserved mechanism for the removal of a wide variety of bulky DNA lesions, including UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4PPs. The NER pathway is versatile in nature and can be divided into two broad categories: transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and global genome repair (GGR). TCR is responsible for the rapid repair of lesions located on the transcribed strand of active genes, whereas GGR is responsible for the repair of lesions throughout the genome. In GGR, XPC is the first damage recognition factor that detects DNA lesions independently of transcription. The subsequent damage recognition steps are similar for TCR and GGR. In GGR, the UV-DDB complex (DDB1 and DDB2) is recruited to the site of DNA damage by XPC. The UV-DDB complex then recruits the core NER factors to the lesion, including the XPE complex (XPC, RAD2 3B, and CETN2), the XPA and RPA proteins. The preincision complex is then formed, including the TFIIH complex, which unwinds the DNA around the lesion, and the DNA polymerase complex, which carries out DNA synthesis and ligation.",
  "Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary regulator of platelet production. TPO is also a cytokine with a variety of other functions. TPO is a cytokine that binds to the c-Mpl receptor. Binding of TPO to c-Mpl activates several signaling pathways. The JAK / STAT pathway is one of the pathways activated by TPO. Other pathways activated by TPO include the MAPK pathway, the phosphoinositol pathway, and the Rac / PAK pathway.",
  "T cells are the key players in the immune system. They are activated by specific interaction with a foreign antigen presented by MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This interaction triggers a cascade of signaling events, leading to proliferation, cytokine production and other cellular responses. The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is the key component of the signaling machinery that mediates antigen recognition and T cell activation. The TCR is a multisubunit complex that consists of a heterodimer of alpha and beta chains that are noncovalently associated with the CD3gamma, CD3delta, CD3epsilon, and CD24 chains. Upon recognition of an antigen-MHC complex, the TCR complex is triggered to form dimers and oligomers, which in turn triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins. The protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn are recruited to the TCR complex and phosphorylate the TCR-associated CD3 chains. This in turn leads to the recruitment and activation of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-7 0. The activation of ZAP-7 0 is essential for the activation of downstream signaling pathways and T cell activation. The adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-7 6 are also phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn and subsequently form a scaffold for the assembly of signaling molecules. The adaptor protein Nck is recruited to the LAT-SLP-7 6 complex and activates the small G protein Rac1 and its effector PAK1. Rac1 and PAK1 are required for the full activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Erk and JNK and for the induction of T cell proliferation. The transcription factor NFAT is activated by the cooperative action of the calcium signal and the PKC signal. The transcription factor NF-AT is activated by the calcium signal and the PKC signal. The transcription factor NF-kB is activated by the PKC signal. The interplay between these signaling pathways leads to the induction of T cell proliferation and cytokine production.",
  "mTOR is a protein kinase that controls cell growth and proliferation through phosphorylation of downstream substrates. The best characterized mTOR substrate is the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K). Another mTOR substrate is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR promotes the formation of the active eIF-4E-BP1 complex that stimulates cap-dependent translation. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, inhibits cell growth and proliferation by blocking phosphorylation of these two substrates. The mTOR pathway is regulated by growth factors, nutrients, and cellular energy status. Growth factors activate mTOR through the PI3 kinase-AKT pathway. Amino acids activate mTOR through a distinct pathway that involves the Rag GTPases. Cellular energy status is also an important regulator of mTOR activity. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cellular energy status, inhibits mTOR activity when the energy supply is sufficient. The activity of mTOR is also regulated by the ras-MAPK pathway. The ras-MAPK pathway activates mTOR through phosphorylation of tuberin (TSC2), a component of the TSC complex that inhibits mTOR activity when phosphorylated. The convergence of these three pathways on mTOR regulation provides a mechanism for integrating multiple signals to control cell growth and proliferation.",
  "The heart responds to increased hemodynamic load by hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes. This compensatory growth is initially a favorable adaptation to increased wall stress, but in the long term it can lead to decompensation and heart failure. The neurohumoral response to increased hemodynamic load activates a signaling pathway that leads to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. This signaling pathway includes the G protein coupled receptor agonist endothelin, the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, and the angiotensin II receptor agonist. Each of these agonists activates a different signaling pathway, but all converge on the activation of the protein kinase AKT. AKT is a serine / threonine kinase that phosphorylates a variety of substrates that regulate cellular growth and survival. AKT phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, preventing it from interacting with the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL. AKT also phosphorylates and inhibits the action of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, preventing it from inducing apoptosis. AKT also phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), inhibiting its activity. Phosphorylation of GSK-3 by AKT inhibits the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, increasing glycogen storage in the cell. AKT also phosphorylates and inhibits the action of the protein kinase mTOR, preventing protein synthesis and cellular growth. AKT is activated by binding of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3) to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT. PIP3 is produced by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzyme, which is activated by binding of growth factor receptors to the cell membrane. The activity of PI3K is regulated by the tumor suppressor PTEN, which dephosphorylates PIP3. The activity of PTEN is inhibited by phosphorylation by the protein kinase PDK1. The activity of AKT is also inhibited by the protein phosphatase PP2A. The activity of PP2A is regulated by the protein kinase NAK-1, which phosphorylates and inhibits PP2A. The activity of NAK-1 is inhibited by phosphorylation by the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CAMKII. The activity of CAMKII is also regulated by the calcium-calmodulin complex. The activity of AKT is also inhibited by the protein kinase PKA, which phosphorylates threonine 3 0 8 in the activation loop of AKT. The activity of PP2A is also inhibited by phosphorylation by PKA. The activity of AKT is regulated by a variety of other signaling pathways. The activity of PP2A is also regulated by the interaction of the A subunit with the B subunit. The B subunit determines the substrate specificity of the PP2A holoenzyme. The activity of PP2A is also regulated by the binding of the protein inhibitor 24 (I24) to the PP2A-A subunit. The activity of PP2A is also regulated by the phosphorylation of the B subunit. The activity of AKT is also regulated by the interaction of AKT with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP9 0). AKT interacts with HSP9 0 through its plekstrin homology (PH) domain. The interaction of AKT with HSP9 0 stabilizes AKT in a conformation that is more favorable for phosphorylation by the kinase PDK1. The interaction of AKT with HSP9 0 also protects AKT from dephosphorylation by PP2A.",
  "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel that regulates the flow of ions and water across cell membranes. Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease characterized by pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal obstruction, and chronic lung disease. The most common mutation in CF patients is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 5 0 8 (F5 0 8del). This mutation results in a protein that is improperly folded and rapidly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mutant CFTR is retained in the ER and is subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The absence of functional CFTR in the plasma membrane leads to a reduction in chloride and bicarbonate transport, which leads to dehydration of the airway surface liquid (ASL), mucus obstruction, and bacterial infection. The reduction in bicarbonate secretion also leads to a reduction in pH of the airway surface liquid. The dehydration of the ASL and the reduced pH of the airway surface liquid may be responsible for the impaired mucociliary clearance and the increased susceptibility of the airways to infection.",
  "The neutrophil is an essential cell type of the innate immune system that is responsible for the destruction of bacteria and fungi. The activation of neutrophils is a complex process that requires the integration of signals from multiple cell surface receptors. One of the key pathways that regulates neutrophil activation is the MAP kinase pathway. The MAP kinase pathway is a highly conserved module of kinases that transduce signals in response to a variety of stimuli. The cascade begins with the activation of a cell surface receptor, typically a G-protein coupled receptor, and proceeds through a series of kinases to activate a MAP kinase, which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets. The neutrophil expresses many of the components of the MAP kinase pathway, including the G-protein coupled receptors FPR1 and FPR2, the small G-protein Ras, Raf-1, Mek1, Erk1 and Erk2, and p21. The neutrophil also expresses the transcription factor NF-kB, which is regulated by the MAP kinase pathway. The activation of NF-kB is involved in the regulation of many genes involved in inflammation and immune responses. The integration of signals from multiple receptors and the integration of these signals with other signaling pathways such as NF-kB activation allows for the integration of signals from multiple stimuli and the fine-tuning of cellular responses.",
  "The chemokine receptor CCR5 is a G-protein coupled receptor that binds the chemokine MIP-1alpha. CCR5 is expressed on activated T cells and macrophages and is involved in the immune response. The CCR5-delta3 2 mutation is a 3 2-base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene that results in a frame shift and a premature stop codon. This mutation is associated with a reduction in HIV-1 infection in homozygotes and a delay in disease progression in heterozygotes. The CCR5-delta3 2 mutation is found in approximately 3 0% of individuals of European descent and is absent in most African populations. The CCR5-delta3 2 mutation is associated with a reduction in the number of CCR5 receptors on the cell surface, and this reduction in receptor number may account for the reduced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in individuals who are homozygous for the mutation.",
  "The exosome is a multiprotein complex that plays a central role in RNA processing in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The exosome consists of a 3 'to 5' exoribonuclease (Rrp4 4p) and three cofactors, a helicase (Ski2p), a 3 'to 5' exonuclease (Rrp4 1p), and a 3 'to 5' exonuclease (Rrp4 5p). The exosome is involved in the processing of stable RNAs, such as 5. 8S rRNA, and of unstable RNAs, such as snoRNAs and mRNAs.",
  "The biosynthesis of GPI-anchored proteins in eukaryotes starts with the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) to form GlcNAc-PI (Figure 1). This reaction is catalyzed by PIG-A / C / T / S / U proteins. After the addition of the first mannose residue by PIG-C, the next four mannose residues are added by PIG-A / B / D / E / F / H, respectively. After the addition of the first ethanolamine phosphate by PIG-U, the ethanolamine phosphate is modified by the addition of myo-inositol, catalyzed by PIG-S, and the GPI-protein is transported to the ER by the action of the DPAGT1 and PGAP3. After the attachment of the C-terminal peptide, the mature GPI-protein is transported to the Golgi and is then either localized to the plasma membrane or to the cell wall.",
  "Mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins that are found on the surface of many animal cells and that are involved in a variety of biological functions. Mucin O-glycans are initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine. The O-glycans can be further modified by a variety of sugars including galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and sialic acid. Mucin O-glycan biosynthesis is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of several different enzymes.",
  "The cell cycle is a series of events that result in the formation of two daughter cells. The cell cycle consists of interphase and mitosis. During interphase, the cell synthesizes and processes mRNA, synthesizes proteins, and synthesizes DNA. During mitosis, the cell divides to form two daughter cells. The cell cycle is regulated by a group of proteins called cyclins. The activity of these cyclins is regulated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The activity of CDKs is regulated by the kinase inhibitory protein kinases, p21-activated kinase (p21-AK) and p27-activated kinase (p27-AK), and the protein kinase Cdk1 inhibitory protein, p16-Kip. The activity of p16-Kip is regulated by the phosphatase Cdc2 5C. The activity of p16-Kip is also regulated by the phosphatase PP2A. The activity of p16-Kip is required for the cell to progress from the G2 phase to mitosis. The activity of p16-Kip is inhibited by the protein kinase Chk1. The activity of p16-Kip is required for the cell to exit from mitosis. The activity of p16-Kip is activated by the protein phosphatase PP2A. The activity of p16-Kip is inhibited by the protein kinase PKA.",
  "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the inflammatory response. IL-1 is produced by many cell types in response to a variety of stimuli, including bacterial products, viruses, and stress. IL-1 is a key mediator of the inflammatory response and is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including arthritis, septic shock, and neurodegenerative disorders. IL-1 is a 2 6 kDa protein that is initially produced as an inactive precursor (p30) that is cleaved by IL-1 converting enzyme (ICE) to produce the active form (1 7kDa). The IL-1 receptor is a heterodimer of an IL-1R1 and IL-1RAcP subunit. The IL-1R1 subunit is responsible for ligand binding and signaling, while the IL-1RAcP subunit is involved in ligand binding and receptor complex formation. IL-1 signaling is mediated by two pathways. The first pathway is rapid and transient and involves activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. The second pathway is slower and more prolonged and involves activation of the MAP kinases JNK and ERK.",
  "The Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases and the STAT family of transcription factors are key mediators of cytokine signaling. Cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1 0, IL-1 2, and IFN-gamma signal through the JAK / STAT pathway to regulate cellular responses. The JAK kinases are associated with the receptor subunits of cytokines and become activated by phosphorylation in response to ligand binding. Activated JAKs phosphorylate the receptor subunits, creating docking sites for STAT proteins that are also phosphorylated by JAKs. Once phosphorylated, STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. The JAK / STAT pathway is negatively regulated by the SOCS proteins, which bind to phosphorylated JAK and receptor subunits to block further signaling. The SOCS proteins are induced by cytokines and other signaling pathways to feedback inhibit signaling.",
  "The binding of agonist to GPCRs triggers the activation of G proteins, which in turn activate downstream effectors. The b2AR is a GPCR that signals primarily through the Gs protein alpha subunit to stimulate AC and the production of cAMP. The activation of AC is opposed by the activity of the inhibitory Gi protein. The b2AR also signals through a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein to activate MAP kinase pathways. The b2AR can also signal through a G protein-independent pathway that involves the beta-arrestin adaptor protein. The activation of MAP kinase pathways by the b2AR can lead to a variety of cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The b2AR can also stimulate potassium efflux through the activation of the potassium channel Kir 3. 1. The activation of Kir 3. 1 is mediated by a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and does not involve the activation of MAP kinase pathways.",
  "The nuclear receptor superfamily consists of a large group of ligand-dependent transcription factors that include the steroid hormone receptors, the retinoid receptors, the vitamin D receptor, the orphan receptors, and orphan receptors for which ligands have not been identified. The orphan receptors are those for which no ligand has been identified. The orphan receptors are involved in a variety of physiological processes including reproduction, development, metabolism, and the immune response. The orphan receptors are also involved in a variety of pathological processes including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is an orphan receptor that is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone development. The orphan receptors T3R, ROR, and RXR are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. The orphan receptors EAR2 and EAR2-related protein are involved in the control of the expression of genes involved in the control of the sleep-wake cycle. The orphan receptors NURR1 and NOR1 are involved in the development of the nervous system. The orphan receptors SHP and GCNF are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The estrogen related receptors (ERRs) are involved in the regulation of genes involved in estrogen metabolism. The orphan receptors PXR and CAR are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs. The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is involved in the metabolism of drugs and steroids. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is involved in the clearance of drugs and steroids.",
  "The innate immune response is a conserved mechanism of defense against infection by foreign pathogens. The response is triggered by the recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria that is recognized by the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The downstream signaling cascade activated by LPS is similar to that of the B cell receptor (BCR) and is mediated by the adaptor protein MyD8 8. The activation of the transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1 leads to the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and the innate immune response.",
  "The molecular pathogenesis of melanoma has been the subject of intense study in recent years. The discovery of mutations in the BRAF gene in a high percentage of melanomas has provided a key step forward in our understanding of this disease. The discovery of mutations in the NRAS gene has also provided a key insight into the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma. The discovery of mutations in the CDKN2A gene has provided a key insight into the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma in patients with a family history of melanoma. The identification of mutations in the KIT gene in patients with melanoma who have an underlying mutation in the KIT gene has provided a therapeutic target in this disease.",
  "Translation of mRNA into protein occurs in the ribosome. The ribosome is a large complex of RNA and protein that translates mRNA into protein. The ribosome is made up of four subunits, three of which contain RNA. The ribosome is made up of three parts: the small subunit, the large subunit, and the stalk. The small subunit contains the mRNA binding site and the binding site for the tRNA. The large subunit contains the peptidyl transferase activity and the binding site for the amino acid transfer RNA. The stalk is a structure that interacts with the large subunit and is involved in binding of the tRNA to the large subunit. Translation is regulated by a variety of factors that bind to the ribosome and affect the binding of the tRNA and the mRNA. The binding of the initiation factor eIF-4E to the ribosome's initiation factor eIF-4G stimulates the binding of the tRNA and the mRNA to the ribosome. The binding of the ternary complex of eIF-2, GTP, and Met-tRNA to the ribosome is inhibited by the binding of eIF-4-binding proteins. Phosphorylation of eIF-2 inhibits the binding of the ternary complex and blocks translation. The binding of the termination factor eRF-3 stimulates the release of the completed protein from the ribosome. Translation of the mRNA for actin is regulated by the binding of a protein called p90 to the 3 'end of the mRNA. The binding of p90 blocks the binding of the ribosome to the end of the mRNA and blocks translation.",
  "The cell cycle is a series of events that result in the duplication and segregation of chromosomes and cellular organelles. The cell cycle is divided into four phases: G1, S, G2 and M, with intervening gaps known as Gap phases. The G1 phase is the period from birth to the beginning of DNA synthesis (S phase). The S phase is the period of DNA replication. The G2 phase is the gap between S and M phases. The M phase is the period of chromosome segregation and cell division. The cell cycle is regulated by a variety of factors, including cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK inhibitors, and tumor suppressor genes. The cyclins are regulatory proteins that activate CDKs, a family of protein kinases. The CDKs phosphorylate other proteins, regulating the cell cycle. The CDK inhibitors oppose the action of the CDKs. The CDK inhibitors include p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, p162CIP, p182KIP, p164ARF, p19ARF, p14ARF, p151CIP, p151KIP, p170KIP, p142Kip, p107Kip, and p21CIP. The tumor suppressor genes include p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, p162CIP, p164ARF, p14ARF, p151CIP, p151KIP, p170Kip, and p107Kip. The tumor suppressor genes are mutated in a variety of cancers, and are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.",
  "The Janus kinase (JAK) / signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is a conserved signaling pathway used by a variety of cytokines to transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. The pathway is activated by binding of cytokines to their receptors, which leads to activation of JAK kinases. Activated JAKs phosphorylate the receptor, creating docking sites for STAT proteins. STAT proteins are phosphorylated by JAKs, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes. Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are a family of proteins that act as negative regulators of the JAK / STAT pathway.",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to harmful stimuli such as infection or tissue injury. The inflammatory response is triggered by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1. These cytokines activate the transcription factor NF-kB, which induces the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immunity. NF-kB is a heterodimer of p5 0 and p6 5 subunits. In the absence of inflammatory stimuli, NF-kB is retained in the cytoplasm by binding to the inhibitor protein IkBa. In response to inflammatory stimuli, IkBa is phosphorylated by IkB kinase, ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. NF-kB is then free to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of its target genes. The activation of NF-kB by TNF-alpha and IL-1 is inhibited by glutathione (GSH). GSH is synthesized in the cytoplasm from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutamate is transported into the cell by the ASC-1 transporter and is then converted to cysteine, which is the rate-limiting step in GSH synthesis. The rate-limiting step in GSH synthesis is the conversion of glutamate and cysteine to the dipeptide, glutathione. The rate-limiting step in GSH synthesis is catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC), which is composed of a heavy (GCLC) and light (GCLM) subunit. The expression of GCLC is induced by NF-kB, and is feedback-inhibited by GSH. The antioxidant function of GSH is important in the inhibition of NF-kB activation by GSH. The inhibition of NF-kB activation by GSH is not due to the antioxidant function of GSH, but is due to the inhibition of IkBa phosphorylation by GSH. The inhibition of IkBa phosphorylation by GSH is not due to inhibition of IkB kinase activity. The inhibition of IkBa phosphorylation by GSH is due to the inhibition of IkB kinase activity by GSH.",
  "The mu opioid receptor (MOP-R) is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) gene family. GPCRs are membrane bound receptors that transduce signals across the plasma membrane in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. The MOP-R is activated by the endogenous opioid peptides enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins. The MOP-R is involved in the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse such as morphine and alcohol. The MOP-R is also the target of many clinically important drugs such as the opiates and the addictive drug methadone. The MOP-R is coupled to G proteins of the Gi / o family. Upon activation, the MOP-R inhibits the production of cAMP by adenylate cyclase. The MOP-R is also coupled to the MAP kinase pathway and the regulation of ion channel activity. The MOP-R is regulated by receptor phosphorylation, receptor desensitization and receptor internalization. Receptor phosphorylation is mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and second messenger-dependent protein kinases. Receptor phosphorylation leads to the binding of arrestins, which uncouples the receptor from its G protein and targets the receptor for internalization. Receptor internalization may be involved in receptor down-regulation, a process in which the number of receptors on the cell surface is reduced by receptor internalization and degradation. Receptor desensitization and internalization may play a role in the development of tolerance to the effects of opiates.",
  "The binding of the neurotransmitter dopamine to the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is associated with the inhibition of cAMP production and the subsequent reduction in PKA activity. The inhibition of PKA activity by DRD2 activation is thought to be mediated by the association of the regulatory subunit of PKA (PKARII) with the regulatory subunit of the G-protein Gs (GNAS). The association of PKARII with GNAS is disrupted by the binding of dopamine to DRD2, releasing PKARII to inhibit cAMP production. The inhibition of PKA activity by DRD2 activation may also be mediated by the association of PKARII with arrestin. The activation of DRD2 also leads to the activation of PKC. The activation of PKC by DRD2 may be mediated by the association of PKC with arrestin. The activation of DRD2 also leads to the activation of MAP kinase pathways. The activation of MAP kinase pathways by DRD2 may be mediated by the association of arrestin with DRD2.",
  "N-glycans are a class of glycans that are covalently attached to asparagine residues of proteins in the N-glycosylation pathway. N-glycans are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. N-glycans are synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane through a series of reactions catalyzed by a multienzyme complex called the N-glycosylation machinery. The first step in the N-glycan synthesis pathway is the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to an asparagine residue of a polypeptide chain. The next step is the addition of a mannose (Man) by the mannosyltransferases. The addition of the first glucose (Glc) by the glucosyltransferases is followed by the addition of the next three sugars, galactose (Gal), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and fucose (Fuc). The last step is the addition of the last sugar, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), by the GlcNAc transferase. Defects in N-glycan synthesis lead to a condition known as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs).",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a critical role in development of many different tissues and organs. The Hh family includes Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh). The Hh family binds to patched (ptc), a receptor with twelve transmembrane domains, to release the inhibition of smoothened (smo), another transmembrane protein. The activation of smoothened leads to the activation of the transcription factor Gli, which is a zinc finger protein. The activation of Gli leads to the transcription of Hh target genes.",
  "Atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a complex genetic background. The disease is characterized by skin barrier dysfunction, increased skin sensitivity to environmental factors, and a Th2-type immune response. The skin barrier dysfunction is caused by reduced expression of filaggrin, a key protein in skin barrier formation. The reduced expression of filaggrin is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding filaggrin. The mutation is associated with atopic eczema and asthma. The skin sensitivity is caused by increased expression of skin-specific proteins, such as the major skin allergen, the house dust mite allergen, and the major cat allergen Fel d 1. The increased expression of these allergens is caused by the Th2-type immune response. The increased expression of Fel d 1 is caused by the mutation of filaggrin. The mutation of filaggrin and the increased expression of Fel d 1 are associated with the development of asthma. The Th2-type immune response is caused by the increased expression of IL-4 and IL-13. The increased expression of IL-4 and IL-13 is caused by the increased expression of the transcription factor, GATA3. The increased expression of IL-4 and IL-13 is also caused by the mutation of filaggrin.",
  "The chemokine Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 play a key role in the homing of hematopoietic cells to the bone marrow and in the development of the immune system. CXCR4 is also expressed on many types of cancer cells and is involved in metastasis. The SDF-1 / CXCR4 pair activates a variety of signaling pathways, including Gi, PI3 kinase, and MAP kinase.",
  "Cell-cell adherens junctions and tight junctions are essential structures for the formation and maintenance of epithelial cell layers. Nectins are Ca 2 + -independent cell-cell adhesion molecules that mediate formation of adherens junctions. Nectins also mediate formation of tight junctions by forming a complex with ZO-1, a tight junction-associated protein. E-cadherin is a major cell-cell adhesion molecule that is essential for formation of both adherens and tight junctions. Tight junctions are formed by occludin, claudins and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). Tight junctions regulate the paracellular movement of ions and macromolecules, and are essential for the formation and maintenance of cell polarity.",
  "The chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR4 are G-protein coupled receptors that bind the chemokine ligands MCP-1, MCP-3, RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1alphaR, respectively. The ligands for these receptors are expressed by cells in the immune system and other tissues, and are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and in the development of the immune system. The binding of chemokine ligands to these receptors activates a variety of signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathways, that lead to changes in cell shape, movement, and gene expression. The activation of these signaling pathways is dependent on the binding of the chemokine ligand to the receptor, and is mediated by the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein. The binding of chemokine ligands to the receptor also leads to the activation of PI3 kinase and the small G protein Rac. The activation of PI3 kinase and Rac leads to the activation of the small G protein Rac, which activates the kinase Pak. The activation of Pak leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, which in turn leads to the activation of the gene for the chemokine receptor CCR5. The activation of this positive feedback loop may lead to the prolonged signaling of the chemokine receptors.",
  "TNF receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRSF1A) is a cell-surface receptor that binds the cytokine TNF. The TNFRSF1A gene is located on human chromosome 1p3 6. 3 and encodes a protein of 4 2 kD.

  "The complement system is a group of plasma proteins that work together to kill bacteria, viruses, and tumor cells. The complement system is activated by three different pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin-mediated pathway, and the alternative pathway. In the classical pathway, antibodies bound to a foreign antigen activate the complement system. In the lectin-mediated pathway, carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria activate the complement system. In the alternative pathway, the complement system is spontaneously activated without the need for an initiating signal. The complement system is activated by three different proteases, C1, C2, and C3 convertase. The first step in all three pathways is the activation of a protease cascade. In the classical pathway, the C1 complex is formed by C1q, C1r, and C1s. In the lectin-mediated pathway, mannan-binding lectin (MBL) binds to carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria or viruses. MBL also binds to MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP). The MASP in turn activates the complement system by cleaving C2 and C4. In the alternative pathway, a C3 convertase is formed by the cleavage of C3 by factor B and factor D. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3 molecules and the amplified C3 convertase cycles through cleavage of factor B and cleavage of C3. The opsonin C3b generated in this reaction binds to bacterial cells and activates the complement system through the formation of the C5 convertase. The membrane attack complex (MAC) formed by the cleavage of C5 by the MAC causes lysis of the bacterial cells.",
  "The complement system is part of the innate immune system and is activated by the presence of pathogens. It consists of more than thirty proteins, including over thirty different complement factors and a complex group of proteins called complement regulators. The complement system is activated through three different pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway and the alternative pathway. The first two pathways are initiated by the recognition of pathogens by antibodies or complement factors, respectively. The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous activation of C3 convertase, which cleaves C3 to C3a and C3b. C3b interacts with complement factor B to form C3 convertase. The cleavage of C3 by C3 convertase leads to the formation of additional C3 convertases, which amplify the complement response. The cleavage of C5 leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which lyses bacterial cells. The opsonization of bacteria and the recruitment of inflammatory cells are the most important functions of complement. The cleavage of prothrombin by the C3 convertase leads to the formation of thrombin, which is important for the coagulation system.",
  "The condensin complex is a key regulator of chromosome structure and segregation during cell division. The condensin complex is composed of five subunits, two of which are structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins. The SMC proteins are members of a highly conserved family of proteins that are involved in chromosome structure and segregation. The condensin complex is recruited to chromatin by the phosphorylation of the SMC proteins by the mitotic kinase, CDK1-cyclin B. The phosphorylation of the SMC proteins by CDK1-cyclin B prevents the condensin complex from reassociating with chromatin after mitosis. The condensin complex is also regulated by the phosphorylation of one of the non-SMC subunits, hCAP-G. The activity of the condensin complex is also regulated by the phosphorylation of the histone H3 by Aurora B. The Aurora B kinase is localized to the chromosomes during mitosis and is required for the condensation of chromosomes. The phosphorylation of histone H3 by Aurora B is required for the phosphorylation of the condensin complex by CDK1-cyclin B. The regulation of the condensin complex by phosphorylation provides a key step in the control of chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis.",
  "Homologous recombination (HR) is a high-fidelity mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that uses the intact copy of homologous sequence as a template for repair. In contrast, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is an error-prone mechanism that joins DNA DSBs without the requirement for extensive homology. NHEJ is the predominant DSB repair mechanism in mammalian cells and is mediated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex, consisting of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the Ku7 0 / Ku8 0 heterodimer, and XRCC4. In addition to the core NHEJ factors, recent studies have identified several NHEJ factors that participate in NHEJ in a more limited manner. These auxiliary NHEJ factors include Artemis, DNA ligase IV (LIG4), XRCC4-like factor (XLF / Cernunnos), polynucleotide kinase (PNK), and WRN. NHEJ is the major mechanism for the repair of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and also functions in the V (D) J recombination required for the assembly of functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes. NHEJ is also involved in the repair of DSBs induced by collapsed replication forks and DSBs induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin and etoposide. NHEJ is initiated by the recognition and binding of the DNA-PK complex to the DSB ends by the Ku heterodimer (Ku7 0 / Ku8 0). The DNA-PK complex then recruits the XRCC4-ligase IV complex, which catalyzes the final step of NHEJ. XLF / Cernunnos and Artemis are also required for NHEJ and are involved in the processing of DNA ends before ligation.

  "The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a large multimeric complex that provides a direct link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. The DGC is localized at the costameric region of the sarcolemma and is thought to provide a structural framework for the plasma membrane. The DGC also provides a scaffold for signaling molecules and may play a role in signal transduction. The DGC is composed of several different proteins including dystrophin, the autosomal recessive Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene product, and the autosomal recessive Becker muscular dystrophy gene product. The extracellular domain of dystrophin binds to the extracellular matrix protein laminin. The N-terminal region of dystrophin interacts with the cytoskeletal proteins actin and the glycoprotein complex. The C-terminal region of dystrophin binds to the cytoplasmic protein, beta-dystroglycan. The autosomal recessive Becker muscular dystrophy gene encodes a slightly truncated form of dystrophin. The absence of dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and the absence of beta-dystroglycan in Becker muscular dystrophy patients results in the destabilization of the entire DGC. The destabilization of the DGC may lead to the loss of signaling functions of the DGC. The DGC may play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The DGC may also play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The DGC may play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The DGC may play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The DGC may play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis through the interaction of the DGC with the small GTPase Rac. Rac is a member of the Rho family of GTPases and is involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Rac interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p21 (RAC1). Rac activation of p21 (RAC1) leads to the activation of downstream kinases such as p21 (RAC1) activated kinase (PAK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Rac activation of JNK may lead to the activation of transcription factors such as p21 (RAC1) activated kinase (PAK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Rac activation of p21 (RAC1) may also lead to the activation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis through the activation of other kinases such as p38 and p38.",

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is over-expressed in many types of human cancer. The binding of EGF to EGFR activates a number of signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival. One of the major signaling pathways activated by EGFR is the Ras / MAPK pathway. Binding of EGF to EGFR activates the Ras / MAPK pathway through the adaptor protein Shc and the Grb2 / Sos complex. Ras activates the Raf / MEK / ERK kinase cascade to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Elk-1. Activation of Elk-1 by the Ras / MAPK pathway induces the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. Another major signaling pathway activated by EGFR is the PI3 kinase pathway. Binding of EGF to EGFR activates the PI3 kinase pathway through the adaptor protein Gab1. PI3 kinase phosphorylates membrane lipids to produce the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates the protein kinase PDK1 and the protein kinase AKT. PDK1 activates AKT by phosphorylating threonine 3 0 8. AKT phosphorylates a number of substrates to promote cell survival. AKT also phosphorylates and inactivates the pro-apoptotic protein BAD to block apoptosis. AKT also phosphorylates and inactivates the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 to block apoptosis. AKT also phosphorylates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p2 7 to block cell cycle progression.",
  "Endocytosis is a mechanism by which cells take up extracellular materials, such as nutrients, and also transmembrane proteins, such as growth factor receptors, viruses, and bacteria, into intracellular compartments. Endocytosis is also involved in the downregulation of signaling from activated receptors. Endocytosis is initiated by the formation of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which pinch off from the plasma membrane to form clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). The GTPase dynamin is essential for the formation of CCPs and the subsequent release of vesicles. After invagination, the membrane of the CCV is connected to the plasma membrane by a narrow neck, which is called the neck. clathrin-associated proteins, such as AP-2, epsin, and ARH, are recruited to the membrane, and clathrin and other accessory proteins are subsequently assembled to form a clathrin lattice on the membrane. After the formation of CCPs, the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) and epsin bind to phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PtdIns (4, 5) P2), a lipid component of the plasma membrane, and clathrin-coated vesicles are formed. The GTPase dynamin is then activated and severs the neck of the CCV, releasing the clathrin-coated vesicles into the cytoplasm. The membrane of the vesicles is then recycled back to the plasma membrane by the action of the clathrin adaptor complex 1 (AP-1) and the monomeric GTPase dynamin. In addition to clathrin, many proteins are involved in endocytosis. For example, ARH is involved in the endocytosis of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Dab2 interacts with clathrin and dynamin and is involved in the endocytosis of the transferrin receptor. DOCK8 is involved in the endocytosis of the chemokine receptor CXCR4.",
  "Intestinal epithelial cells line the gastrointestinal tract and provide a critical barrier to the external environment. To perform this barrier function, intestinal epithelial cells form a polarized monolayer that is anchored to the underlying basement membrane by tight junctions. Intestinal epithelial cells also express a variety of surface receptors that are involved in nutrient absorption and innate immunity. Disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier function is associated with a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease. In response to injury, intestinal epithelial cells proliferate and migrate to re-establish barrier function. This process is associated with dramatic changes in gene expression, including increased expression of trefoil factors, growth factors, and mucins. Alterations in gene expression are mediated by a variety of signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.",
  "Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. The etiology of ovarian cancer is not well understood, but it is believed that the disease arises from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) through a process of metaplasia or de-differentiation. The most common type of ovarian cancer is the epithelial ovarian cancer, which accounts for approximately 9 0% of all ovarian cancers. The most common histological type of epithelial ovarian cancer is the serous ovarian cancer, which accounts for approximately 5 0% of all epithelial ovarian cancers. The second most common type is the endometrioid ovarian cancer, which accounts for approximately 1 0% of all epithelial ovarian cancers. The third most common type is the mucinous ovarian cancer, which accounts for approximately 3% of all epithelial ovarian cancers. The fourth type is the undifferentiated ovarian cancer, which accounts for approximately 2% of all epithelial ovarian cancers. The fifth type is the germ cell tumor ovarian cancer. The most common symptom of ovarian cancer is lower abdominal pain or distention. The diagnosis is usually made by a combination of physical examination, ultrasound, and serum CA1 2 5 levels. The treatment of ovarian cancer is surgical, and the most effective method of surgical cytoreduction is to remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced ovarian cancer is less than 3 0%. The most effective treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer is a combination of surgical cytoreduction and chemotherapy. The most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent is cisplatin, but other drugs such as taxol, topotecan, and gemcitabine are also used.",
  "The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a fundamental metabolic pathway that produces NADH and FADH2 to drive the electron transport chain (ETC). The ETC is a series of five protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane that transfer electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen to generate a proton gradient that is used to produce ATP. The TCA cycle is a series of reactions that convert acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide and water. Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolite that is derived from glycolysis, the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, and the Kreb's cycle. In the Kreb's cycle, acetyl-CoA is converted to oxaloacetate by the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase. The next step in the pathway is the condensation of two molecules of oxaloacetate to form citrate. Citrate is transported to the mitochondrial matrix and cleaved by the enzyme aconitase to produce two molecules of isocitrate. Isocitrate is then dehydrated to produce a-ketoglutarate by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. A-ketoglutarate is a key metabolite that is converted to glutamate by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamate is converted to glutamine by the enzyme glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is transported out of the cell and is converted back to glutamate by the enzyme glutamate synthase. Glutamate is converted to the amino acids aspartate and proline, which are important for protein synthesis and the osmotic regulation of cells, respectively. The enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase also plays a key role in regulating the flow of carbon through the TCA cycle. When the supply of amino acids is limited, glutamate dehydrogenase converts glutamate to a-ketoglutarate, which enters the TCA cycle to produce NADH and FADH2. When there is excess amino acids, glutamate dehydrogenase is inhibited, and glutamate dehydrogenase is converted to a-ketoglutarate, which enters the TCA cycle to produce NADH and FADH2. The transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen is coupled to the pumping of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the enzyme ATP synthase to produce ATP. The transfer of electrons from NADH to oxygen is coupled to the transfer of protons by the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. The transfer of electrons from NADH to oxygen is not coupled to the transfer of protons by cytochrome c oxidase. The transfer of electrons from FADH2 to oxygen is coupled to the transfer of protons by cytochrome c oxidase.",
  "The liver plays a central role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The liver is also the major site for the synthesis of plasma proteins, including albumin, fibrinogen, transferrin, and alpha-antitrypsin.

The liver is also a major endocrine organ, producing a variety of hormones, such as insulin, growth hormone, and glucagon.",
  "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of macromolecules that provides structural support and regulates cellular functions. The ECM is secreted by cells and is deposited in the ECM. Integrins are cell surface receptors that bind to ECM proteins and transduce signals into the cell in response to the ECM. The interaction of integrins with the ECM regulates cell shape, migration, proliferation, and survival. The ECM also provides a scaffold for the deposition of other ECM components. The deposition of ECM components is regulated by growth factors and cytokines. The deposition of ECM components regulates the expression of integrins and other ECM components. The interaction of integrins with the ECM regulates the organization of the cytoskeleton and the formation of focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are macromolecular complexes that form at the ends of actin stress fibers and contain integrins, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins. Integrins transmit signals into the cell in response to the ECM through the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the formation of focal adhesions. FAK is a tyrosine kinase that is activated by integrins and is involved in the regulation of cellular functions such as migration and proliferation. The interaction of integrins with the ECM also activates the small GTPase RhoA, which regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. RhoA is regulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Lbc, and the GTPase activating protein (GAP), Rho-GAP. The interaction of integrins with the ECM also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The activation of the MAPK pathway by integrins is mediated by the small GTPase Rac and the exchange factor Sos-1. The activation of Rac by integrins leads to the formation of lamellipodia and the activation of the MAPK pathway. The activation of Rac also leads to the activation of p130CAS, a component of focal adhesions. The activation of p130CAS by integrins leads to the formation of focal adhesions and the activation of the MAPK pathway. The interaction of integrins with the ECM also activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. The activation of JNK by integrins is mediated by MEKK1 and is independent of the small GTPases Rac and Rho. The activation of JNK by integrins is required for the induction of apoptosis in response to the interaction of cells with the ECM.",
  "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel that is expressed in epithelial cells. Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF). The most common mutation in CFTR is deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 5 0 8 (deltaF5 0 8). This mutation results in misfolding of the protein and its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, CFTR is degraded by the proteasome. In addition, a small amount of CFTR reaches the plasma membrane, but it is rapidly removed from the cell surface by endocytosis and subsequent degradation in lysosomes. The absence of functional CFTR at the surface of epithelial cells leads to the dehydration of airway surface liquid (ASL) and mucus stasis, which are the hallmarks of CF. The dehydrated mucus in the airways leads to chronic infection and inflammation, which in turn causes progressive lung damage. The most common mutation in the gene encoding the beta-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which causes Liddle's syndrome, also results in dehydration of airway surface liquid.",
  "The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, are involved in the development of the nervous system and the formation of topographic maps in the visual system. They are also involved in the development of the cardiovascular system and bone morphogenesis. The ephrins are membrane bound ligands that interact with the ephrins on adjacent cells. Eph receptors are also membrane bound, but their cytoplasmic domains lack catalytic activity. Instead, they interact with other signaling molecules through their cytoplasmic domains. The ephrins are also membrane bound, but are attached to the cell membrane by a GPI linkage in the case of the ephrins B class. The ephrins are attached to the plasma membrane by a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. The ephrins are divided into two classes, A and B. The A ephrins are bound by the A class Eph kinases and the B ephrins by the B class kinases. The ephrins are expressed on the surface of neurons and their expression is regulated in a topographic manner. The Eph kinases are expressed on the surface of adjacent cells and interact with the ephrins on the surface of the same cell.

  "The inflammatory response is an essential component of host defense. The response is initiated by the recognition of invading organisms or their products by the innate immune system. Macrophages and neutrophils are the first line of defense against infection. Macrophages and neutrophils phagocytose foreign bodies and kill them by generating reactive oxygen species and by secreting proteases. Macrophages and neutrophils also secrete cytokines and chemokines that recruit and activate other immune cells. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF are the key mediators of the inflammatory response. The production of these cytokines is induced by microbial products through the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. The activation of NF-kB is negatively regulated by IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates IkB and targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The activation of NF-kB is also negatively regulated by the I-kappa B kinase-associated protein A2 0. The activation of NF-kB is also negatively regulated by the caspase 8-dependent cleavage of the NF-kB p6 5 subunit. The activation of NF-kB is also negatively regulated by the I-kappa B kinase-associated protein A2 0. The activation of NF-kB is also negatively regulated by the caspase 8-dependent cleavage of the NF-kB p6 5 subunit. The activation of NF-kB is also negatively regulated by the caspase 8-dependent cleavage of the IL-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1). The cleavage of IRAK-1 by caspase 8 dissociates the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (AcP) from the receptor and is required for IL-1 signaling.",
  "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain. The GABA receptor is a pentamer, with each subunit contributing an integral transmembrane channel-forming domain. The five subunits are designated alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and rho.

  "Proteoglycans are a class of glycoproteins covalently modified with long polysaccharide chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units. The polysaccharide chains are attached to the protein core via a specific linkage region consisting of a serine or threonine residue and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG). The GAG chains can be modified by epimerization and sulfation at various positions. Proteoglycans are found in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface and are involved in a variety of biological processes. The core proteins of the core proteins are encoded by a family of genes with similar structural organization. The protein core is followed by a signal peptide, a propeptide, a domain with several potential N-glycosylation sites, and the GAG attachment domain. The GAG chains are synthesized by a series of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus. The chain polymerization is initiated by the transfer of a xylose residue to a serine residue. Chondroitin sulfate is the most common GAG, and its polymerization is catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme chondroitin synthase. Chondroitin polymerization is terminated by the addition of a sulfate group to the N-acetyl-galactosamine residue. The polymerization of heparan sulfate and heparin requires the addition of N-acetylglucosamine residues. The polymerization of dermatan sulfate requires the addition of glucuronic acid residues. Chondroitin and heparan sulfate chains are further modified by epimerization and sulfation.",
  "The Cbl gene encodes a protein of 80kDa that is recognized as an important component of tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways. Cbl contains a tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) domain, a C30-RING finger domain, and a proline-rich region. The TKB domain interacts with activated tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF receptor, PDGF receptor, and c-Kit, through recognition of phosphorylated tyrosine residues.

The Cbl protein is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues by activated tyrosine kinases, and these phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for other signaling molecules, including the Crk, Nck, and Src family kinases. The Cbl protein also interacts with the p8 5 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) through its proline-rich region and with the Cbl-associated protein (CAP) through its C-terminal Cbl-TKB domain. Cbl-mediated recruitment of PI3K to activated tyrosine kinases may provide a mechanism for the positive regulation of tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways by Cbl.",

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). The EGFR is involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. Overexpression of the EGFR has been observed in a number of human cancers including those of the breast, lung, and colon. The EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptors that also includes ErbB-2 / neu, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4. Binding of ligand to the EGFR induces receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the activated receptor serve as docking sites for signaling molecules containing SH2 domains.

  "Eosinophils are leukocytes that are involved in inflammatory responses and are found in high numbers in tissues affected by asthma and other allergic conditions. Eosinophils are recruited to tissues by a variety of chemokines and cytokines, including eotaxin, RANTES, and IL-5. The chemokine eotaxin is a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils and is found in high levels in the lungs of asthmatic patients. The chemokine receptor CCR3 is a receptor for eotaxin and is expressed on eosinophils. Binding of eotaxin to CCR3 leads to eosinophil chemotaxis, degranulation, and production of reactive oxygen species. The small GTPase RhoA is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and changes in cell shape that are involved in chemotaxis. RhoA is activated by the guanine exchange factors (GEFs), which are involved in the exchange of GDP for GTP on RhoA. The GEFs are regulated by a variety of factors, including phosphorylation by PKC and other kinases.

The RhoA-specific GAP, p19RhoGAP, is also regulated by phosphorylation by PKC and PKA. The activity of RhoA is also regulated by the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). The GDI-RhoA complex is found in the cytosol and is inactive. When phosphorylated by PKC and PKA, the GDI dissociates from RhoA, allowing RhoA to be activated and move to the membrane. The activation of RhoA by phosphorylation by PKC and PKA is part of a feedback loop that further activates RhoA and further increases actin polymerization and cell shape changes. The activation of RhoA by GEF-H1 also activates the p38 MAPK pathway, providing another positive feedback loop.

  "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) is a protein kinase that is highly expressed in the brain. It is activated by the cleavage of its activator p3 5 to p2 5. The cleavage of p3 5 to p2 5 is mediated by the calcium-dependent protease calpain. The p2 5 / cdk5 kinase is highly toxic to neurons and its activity is elevated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The activation of cdk5 by p2 5 leads to hyperphosphorylation of tau, aberrant activation of the protease, calpain, and cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). The amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is toxic to neurons and can lead to activation of calpain and cleavage of p3 5 to p2 5. The activation of cdk5 by p2 5 and the subsequent phosphorylation of tau and APP lead to a series of events that result in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",
  "The immune system is a network of cells and molecules that respond to each other to protect the body from infection and to regulate the response to environmental antigens. The antigen-specific immune response is mediated by T cells that recognize antigens presented by specialized antigen-presenting cells, the dendritic cells. The antigen-presenting cells are located in tissues throughout the body and are found in the skin, lung, and intestine. Dendritic cells are a heterogeneous population of cells that are found in low numbers in the blood and lymphoid tissues, but are abundant in the tissues where they patrol the body. The antigen-presenting cells take up antigens from tissues and migrate to the lymphoid tissues to induce T cell activation. The activation of T cells requires two signals. The first signal is provided by the interaction of the T cell receptor with antigen presented by MHC on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. The second signal is provided by cytokines produced by activated antigen-presenting cells that stimulate T cell proliferation and differentiation. The cytokines that stimulate T cell activation include IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. The cytokines stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells. Th1 cells produce IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha and are involved in cell-mediated immune responses. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 and are involved in the humoral immune response. The balance of Th1 and Th2 cells determines the type of immune response. The chemokine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that are expressed on the surface of leukocytes and are involved in the migration of leukocytes to tissues and the immune response. The chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR4 are involved in the migration of leukocytes to tissues. The CCR5 receptor is used by the HIV virus to enter cells and is the receptor for the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1) and MIP-1 beta. The CCR2 receptor is used by the chemokine MCP-1 to attract monocytes to tissues. The CCR3 receptor is used by the eosinophil chemoattractant eotaxin to attract eosinophils to tissues.",
  "Leukocytes play a key role in inflammation and wound healing. They are recruited to sites of inflammation by a variety of chemokines, including the CXC chemokine ligand 1 2 (CXCL1 2). The binding of CXCL1 2 to its receptor CXCR4 activates a signaling pathway that leads to actin polymerization and the subsequent migration of the cell. The signaling pathway that leads to actin polymerization is not well understood. In this study, the tyrosine kinase LYN was found to be involved in the signaling pathway that leads to actin polymerization and cell migration. The activation of LYN by CXCL1 2 leads to the activation of the small GTPase RAC, which in turn activates the kinase PAK1. PAK1 phosphorylates the actin-binding protein Cofilin, which leads to the formation of actin fibers and the migration of the cell. The activation of LYN by CXCL1 2 is also involved in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, which leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines. The activation of LYN by CXCL1 2 may also play a role in the metastasis of cancer cells. The activation of LYN by CXCL1 2 may also play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.",
  "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) / AKT pathway is a key regulator of cell survival, proliferation and growth. The PI3K / AKT pathway is activated by many different growth factors and is a key mediator of cell survival. The PI3K / AKT pathway is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. The PTEN gene is mutated in a large fraction of prostate cancers, suggesting that activation of the PI3K / AKT pathway contributes to prostate cancer development. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is also mutated in a large fraction of prostate cancers. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. The activation of the PI3K / AKT pathway inhibits apoptosis, contributing to the development of cancer. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is also involved in the regulation of transcription. The p53 tumor suppressor protein binds to the transcription factor E2F-1 and inhibits transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis.",
  "Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles involved in a variety of metabolic processes, including fatty acid alpha- and beta-oxidation, biosynthesis of ether lipids, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Peroxisomes are essential for human health, as demonstrated by the existence of a group of inherited peroxisomal disorders (PDs), which are caused by a defect in peroxisome biogenesis or peroxisomal metabolism. PDs are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, including severe mental retardation, liver dysfunction, and peroxisome biogenesis defects. Peroxisomes are formed and proliferated by a complex and coordinated process called peroxisome biogenesis. Peroxisomes are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and the membrane proteins PEX3 and PEX19 are the key factors for the formation of peroxisomes. PEX3 is a receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs), and PEX19 is an escort protein that chaperones PMPs to the peroxisomal membrane. After the formation of the peroxisomal membrane, peroxisomal matrix proteins are translocated into the peroxisomal matrix by a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) -dependent or -independent pathway. Peroxisomes are highly dynamic organelles, and their proliferation is regulated by a complex interplay of PEX genes and PEX proteins.",
  "Hypoxia is a common feature of the tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in cellular and systemic adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of alpha and beta subunits. The HIF-1 alpha subunit is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions, but is stabilized and activated under hypoxic conditions. HIF-1 activates the transcription of genes involved in erythropoiesis, glucose metabolism, and vascularization. HIF-1 is also activated by the hypoxia-mimetic agent desferroxamine. HIF-1 activation by genetic alterations in cancer may contribute to the development and progression of many human cancers.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. It is comprised of a variety of cells and molecules that act in concert to recognize and respond to microbial pathogens. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of pattern recognition receptors that recognize microbial products and activate innate immune responses. TLRs are expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells and respond to microbial components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoproteins, and peptidoglycans. Upon recognition of microbial components, TLRs activate signaling pathways that lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules. These cytokines and costimulatory molecules promote activation of adaptive immune responses.",
  "The MAPK pathway is a highly conserved module of kinases that transmits signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in response to a variety of stimuli. The MAPK module consists of a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPKK or MEK, and a MAPK. The MAPKKKs are the primary level of regulation of the MAPK module. The MAPKKKs are themselves regulated by phosphorylation and / or by association with other proteins. The MAPKKKs that activate the JNK and p3 8 pathways include MEKK1, MEKK4, and ASK1. These kinases are activated by the small GTPases Rac and / or Cdc4 2. The JNK and p3 8 pathways are also activated by the MAPKK kinases (MAPKKs) MKK4 and MKK7, and MKK3 and MKK6, respectively. The JNK and p3 8 pathways are involved in the regulation of gene expression, apoptosis, and inflammation.",
  "Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer. The genetic alterations associated with PTC include RET / PTC rearrangements and activating mutations of the RAS and BRAF genes. The RET / PTC rearrangements result in ligand-independent activation of RET kinase. The RAS and BRAF mutations lead to constitutive activation of the downstream signaling pathways. The BRAF mutation is the most common genetic alteration in PTC and is found in about one-half of all cases. The presence of these genetic alterations is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and a reduced disease-specific survival.",
  "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organ systems. The disease is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products form a complex that acts as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the small G-protein Rheb. The activity of the TSC complex is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2, which leads to the accumulation of active Rheb and the subsequent activation of mTOR and S6K. The regulation of p4EBP-1and pS6K by mTOR also contributes to the activation of cell growth.",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of many cell types. In skeletal muscle IGF-1 stimulates differentiation and inhibits proliferation. The mitogenic effects of IGF-1 are mediated by the MAP kinase pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway. The differentiation effects of IGF-1 are mediated by the PI3 kinase pathway. The downstream targets of PI3 kinase that stimulate differentiation are not known. One target of PI3 kinase that may be involved in differentiation is the transcription factor NFAT. The calcineurin pathway also appears to be involved in IGF-1 signaling. Calcineurin is a calcium activated phosphatase that is involved in muscle differentiation. Calcineurin is activated by an increase in intracellular calcium and is inhibited by the binding of the 14-3-3 proteins. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT transcription factors, causing them to translocate to the nucleus and activate genes containing NFAT response elements. IGF-1 activates calcineurin and stimulates NFAT transcriptional activity. The activation of calcineurin by IGF-1 is mediated by the calcium / calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase, PP2B. The activation of calcineurin by IGF-1 is required for IGF-1 to stimulate differentiation. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A or by expression of a 14-3-3 protein blocks the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate differentiation. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A also blocks the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate hypertrophy. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate proliferation. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A also does not block the activation of MAP kinase by IGF-1. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate proliferation. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate proliferation. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the activation of PI3 kinase by IGF-1. The inhibition of PI3 kinase by wortmannin does not block the activation of calcineurin by IGF-1. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the activation of MAP kinase by IGF-1. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does block the activation of MAP kinase by IGF-1. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the activation of AKT by IGF-1. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the activation of mTOR by IGF-1. The inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A does not block the activation of GSK-3 by IGF-1. The inhibition of GSK-3 by IGF-1 does not appear to be mediated by calcineurin.",

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by binding of its ligands, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors. The EGFR is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and motility. Overexpression of the EGFR has been observed in a number of human cancers and is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a poor prognosis. The EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes ErbB-2 (HER2 / neu), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4). The ErbB receptors are formed by the association of two subunits, with the ErbB-1 / EGFR being the preferred binding partner. Binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain serve as binding sites for a variety of signaling molecules containing SH2 or PTB domains. These molecules include the SHC adaptor protein, the Grb2 adaptor protein, phospholipase C-gamma, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), and the protein tyrosine kinase Src. The recruitment of these signaling molecules to the plasma membrane leads to the activation of a number of signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathway, the PI-3K pathway, and the JAK / STAT pathway.

  "The binding of agonist to GPCRs leads to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, which in turn activate a variety of signaling pathways. The activation of G proteins by GPCRs leads to the dissociation of the alpha and beta gamma subunits. The alpha subunits of the G proteins can activate a variety of signaling pathways, including the PLCbeta / PKC and the MAPK cascades. The beta gamma subunits of G proteins activate the tyrosine kinase Src and the small G protein Ras. The activation of Src and Ras leads to the activation of the Raf-1 / MEK / ERK kinase cascade and ultimately to the regulation of transcription factors. The beta gamma subunits of G proteins also activate the MAP kinase cascade, although the mechanism is not yet known. The activation of the MAP kinase cascade by GPCRs is a transient response, lasting only a few minutes. The attenuation of the MAP kinase cascade is due in part to the activation of a tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, that dephosphorylates and inactivates the kinases in the cascade. The activation of the MAP kinase cascade by GPCRs is also attenuated by the induction of a protein, arrestin, that binds to the activated GPCR and blocks further G protein activation. The activation of the MAP kinase cascade by GPCRs leads to the regulation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and CREB.

The EGFR is frequently over-expressed in a variety of human cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. The EGFR is a member of a family of closely related receptors (HERs) that also includes HER2 / neu. Binding of EGF or TGF-alpha to the EGFR leads to receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and activation of downstream signaling pathways.

These pathways regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and motility.",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterized by dilation and impaired contraction of the left ventricle that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Familial DCM is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of 1: 25 0 0. and is caused by mutations in at least 1 1 different genes. The first gene identified to be associated with familial DCM was the gene encoding beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC). Since then, mutations in the genes encoding for cardiac troponin T (TNNTI), cardiac troponin C (TNNC1), tropomyosin (TPM1), alpha-tropomyosin (TPM2), and dystrophin (DMD) have been identified. The mutations in these genes lead to a reduced force generation and / or a reduced response to calcium. In addition, mutations in the genes encoding for the cytoskeletal proteins dystrophin (DMD) and the Z-disk protein alpha-actin (ACTC) have been associated with DCM. The cytoskeletal proteins dystrophin and alpha-actin are part of a complex of proteins that stabilizes the sarcomere and transmits force from the myofilaments to the extracellular matrix. The loss of this force transmission leads to dilation of the left ventricle.",
  "The immune system consists of two major components, the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system consists of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and granulocytes. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and is non-specific. The adaptive immune system consists of B cells, T cells, and antigen-specific (or MHC-restricted) cells. B cells produce antigen-specific antibodies. T cells are classified into two types, T helper cells (Th) and T cytotoxic cells (Tc). Th cells are involved in the activation of B cells and macrophages, whereas Tc cells are responsible for direct killing of infected cells. Upon activation, B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Th cells are further subdivided into Th1 and Th2 cells, depending on their cytokine production profile. Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. Macrophages and granulocytes phagocytose and kill invading microorganisms. Macrophages also activate the complement system and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells by two mechanisms: the direct killing of the target cell by cytotoxic granules and Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis. Cytotoxic T cells are activated by interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with antigen-MHC-I complex on the target cell. B cells produce antigen-specific antibodies that bind to the antigen on the surface of an infected cell, and then the antibody-antigen complex is recognized by the TCR on the cytotoxic T cell.",

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4. The ErbB receptors are activated by ligands of the EGF family, including EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA), heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), amphiregulin (AR), betacellulin (BTC) and epiregulin (EPR). The ligands are produced as transmembrane precursors that are cleaved to release the soluble factors. The soluble factors bind to the ErbB receptors and induce receptor dimerization and activation. The ligands are classified as either high-affinity (EGF, TGFA, AR, BTC) or low-affinity (HB-EGF, EPR). The ErbB receptors are non-covalently associated dimers formed from a combination of two of the four receptors. The most common dimer is the EGFR / ErbB2 heterodimer. The ErbB receptors contain an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a cytoplasmic tail with autophosphorylation sites. The binding of ligand to the extracellular domain induces a conformational change in the receptor that allows the dimerization of the receptor. The dimerization induces the activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail. The binding of ligands to the ErbB receptors induces a number of different cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation and migration. The cellular responses are determined by the specific tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated and the proteins that bind to these residues. The cellular responses are transient in the case of the EGFR and the ErbBs, with receptor activation and phosphorylation rapidly followed by receptor down-regulation and dephosphorylation. The cellular responses are more sustained in the case of the EGF receptor. The cellular responses are determined by the specific tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated and the proteins that bind to these residues. The cellular responses are transient in the case of the EGF receptor and the ErbBs, with receptor activation and phosphorylation rapidly followed by receptor down-regulation and dephosphorylation.

  "The immune system is made up of cells that communicate with each other to defend the body against infection and other harmful agents. The body's immune system can be divided into two broad categories: innate and adaptive. The innate immune system responds to infection by a variety of mechanisms, including the release of cytokines and inflammatory factors, the activation of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, and the stimulation of neutrophils and eosinophils. The adaptive immune system responds to infection and other forms of stress by generating antigen-specific immune responses. The adaptive immune system is comprised of two distinct types of cells, lymphocytes and antibodies. B cells produce antibodies, which are composed of two chains, one of which is the heavy chain and one of which is the light chain. The heavy chain contains the antigen-binding site, while the light chain is used to form the antibody's effector functions. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, and into memory B cells that can respond rapidly to future infections. T cells are lymphocytes that respond to antigen by proliferating and differentiating into effector cells with different functions. Naive T cells differentiate into two types of cells, Th1 and Th2 cells, based on their cytokine expression profiles. Th1 cells express the cytokine interferon-g (IFN-g) and are involved in cellular immunity, while Th2 cells express the cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 and are involved in humoral immunity. The differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells is influenced by the cytokines IL-1 2 and IL-4, respectively. Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are lymphocytes that respond to infection by killing infected cells. CTLs are a heterogeneous population, with some cells expressing the CD4 antigen and other cells expressing the CD8 antigen.",
  "Blood coagulation is a physiological process that leads to the formation of a clot to stop bleeding. The clotting cascade is initiated by tissue injury, activation of the clotting cascade, and formation of a clot. The clotting cascade is a series of enzymatic reactions that lead to the formation of a clot. The clotting cascade begins with the activation of prothrombin by the tissue factor (TF) -factor VIIa complex. The TF-factor VIIa complex activates factor X, which in turn activates prothrombin. The prothrombin activation fragment (F1 + 2) is released from prothrombin and is a marker of prothrombin activation. The clotting cascade is completed when thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin monomers. The fibrin monomers polymerize to form a clot. The clotting cascade is regulated by a variety of factors. Antithrombin III (AT-III) is the most important physiologic inhibitor of thrombin. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin by forming a complex with thrombin. The activity of AT-III is enhanced by heparin. Antithrombin III deficiency can result in thrombosis. Congenital AT-III deficiency is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Congenital AT-III deficiency is usually associated with a mild to moderate bleeding tendency. Congenital protein C deficiency is also associated with a mild bleeding tendency. Protein C is a cofactor in the inactivation of thrombin and factor Va by activated protein C. Protein C deficiency is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Protein C deficiency is usually associated with a severe bleeding tendency. Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is usually associated with a mild to moderate bleeding tendency. Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is an inherited disorder of fibrinogen that is characterized by a normal level of fibrinogen but an abnormal fibrinogen molecule.

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGFR is activated by the peptide growth factors EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). The EGFR is widely expressed in normal tissues and its activation has been implicated in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. Overexpression of the EGFR has been observed in a variety of human cancers and has been associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. The EGFR is a heterodimer consisting of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain containing a tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of EGF or TGF-alpha to the extracellular domain of the EGFR induces receptor dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase domain. The EGFR is internalized upon ligand binding and is subsequently degraded in the lysosome. Activation of the EGFR also leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the ras-raf-MEK-MAPK pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and the Jak / Stat pathway. The ras-raf-MEK-MAPK pathway is activated by the binding of growth factors to the EGFR and leads to the activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and ELK-1. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation by the EGFR leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and the mTOR pathway. STAT proteins are transcription factors that are activated by tyrosine kinases, including the EGFR. The Jak / Stat pathway is activated by the EGFR and leads to the activation of STAT-1 and STAT-3. The activation of these pathways by the EGFR contributes to the proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of EGFR activation.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins are secreted morphogens that regulate cell fate and proliferation during development. Wnt signaling is involved in many aspects of embryonic development, including cell fate specification in the central nervous system, the patterning of the mesoderm and endoderm, and the development of the limbs. Wnt signaling is also involved in stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration in the adult. Wnt signaling is blocked by the action of secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), which bind Wnt proteins and block Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is also blocked by Dickkopf (Dkk) proteins, which bind to the Wnt co-receptor LRP 5 / 6 and block Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is blocked by the action of the Axin complex, which includes the tumor suppressor protein APC, the protein kinases GSK-3-beta and CKI-alpha, and the protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1. Binding of Wnt to Frizzled leads to the recruitment of Disheveled to the plasma membrane and the subsequent stabilization of beta-catenin. Stabilized beta-catenin is transported into the nucleus, where it associates with TCF / LEF family transcription factors to activate gene expression. Wnt signaling is blocked by the action of the Wnt antagonists Dkk and sFRP. Wnt signaling is also blocked by the action of the Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF). WIF is secreted by the Wnt-receiving cell and binds to Wnt, blocking its interaction with the Frizzled receptor.",
  "Bladder cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in the United States and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The disease is characterized by a high recurrence rate and a propensity for progression to invasive and metastatic disease. The standard treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is transurethral resection followed by intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy. For muscle invasive bladder cancer, radical cystectomy with regional lymph node dissection is the standard treatment. However, approximately 5 0% of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer develop metastatic disease, with a median survival of approximately 1 2 months. The 5-year survival rate for metastatic bladder cancer is less than 5%. The development of effective systemic therapy for advanced bladder cancer has been challenging. The identification of molecular targets and the development of novel therapeutic agents are expected to improve the treatment of this disease. This review will focus on the molecular pathogenesis of bladder cancer and the potential molecular targets for the treatment of this disease. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > \u2583",
  "The ATM gene is mutated in the rare cancer syndrome, AT, which is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and predisposition to cancer. The ATM protein is a member of a family of PI-3 kinases that includes DNA-PK, ATR and hSMG1. ATM is a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation and phosphorylates proteins involved in cell cycle control and DNA repair. ATM phosphorylates BRCA1, Chk2, and p5 3 in response to ionizing radiation. Phosphorylation of Chk2 and BRCA1 by ATM leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1 / S and G2 / M checkpoints, respectively. Phosphorylation of p5 3 by ATM leads to increased transcription of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p2 1, which mediates cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint. Other ATM substrates include the DNA repair proteins NBS1 and the DNA-PK catalytic subunit. ATM also phosphorylates the histone variant H2AX in response to ionizing radiation, which may contribute to the recruitment of ATM and other factors to sites of DNA damage. The role of ATM in DNA repair is supported by the observation that AT cells are defective in repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Other ATM substrates include the transcription factor NF-kB, the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, and the DNA repair protein Rad5 0. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of c-Abl leads to activation of downstream signaling pathways that promote cell survival. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Rad5 0 may be involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination.",
  "Interleukin-1 2 (IL-1 2) is a key cytokine in cell-mediated immunity that stimulates the proliferation and activation of T-cells. IL-1 2 is produced by activated macrophages and other cells in response to infection and stimulates cells of the immune system to respond. IL-1 2 is required for cell-mediated immune responses, such as the response of T-cells to infection by intracellular parasites, and for the development of Th1 cells, a subset of T-cells that produce interferon-gamma. The activity of IL-1 2 is opposed by IL-4, which stimulates the proliferation and activation of Th2 cells, a subset of T-cells that produce different cytokines. The activity of IL-1 2 is opposed by IL-10, a cytokine produced by Th2 cells that inhibits the activity of IL-1 2. The IL-1 2 and IL-4 pathways are mutually antagonistic, and the relative amounts of IL-1 2 and IL-10 produced by a cell can determine whether a cell is a Th1 or Th2 cell. The activity of IL-1 2 is also opposed by the cytokine IL-10, which is produced by Th2 cells and inhibits the activity of IL-1 2. The balance of these cytokines determines the type of immune response that develops. The activity of IL-1 2 is also opposed by the cytokine TGF-beta, which is produced by many cell types and inhibits the activity of IL-1 2. The activity of IL-1 2 is also opposed by the cytokine IL-1RA, which is produced by many cell types and binds to the IL-1 2 receptor to block the interaction of IL-1 2 with its receptor.

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The EGFR is activated by binding of its ligands, including EGF, TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). The binding of ligands to the EGFR induces receptor dimerization, activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for proteins containing SH2 or PTB domains, which transduce the signal downstream. The adaptor protein Shc binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine 1 0 6 8 of the EGFR and couples the receptor to the Ras / MAPK pathway. The Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine 1 0 4 5 of the EGFR and targets the receptor for proteosomal degradation. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine 1 0 6 8 of the EGFR and dephosphorylates the receptor. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B dephosphorylates the EGFR and deactivates the EGFR.",
  "The chemokine receptor CCR5 is expressed on macrophages and is a coreceptor for macrophage tropic strains of HIV-1. Macrophage tropic HIV-1 strains use CCR5 as a coreceptor to gain entry into macrophages. The chemokine ligand for CCR5, MIP-1 alpha, is a natural ligand for this receptor and inhibits the infection of macrophages by macrophage tropic HIV-1 strains. The signaling pathways used by CCR5 to induce cellular responses are not well characterized. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by CCR5 is one pathway that may be involved in CCR5 signaling. The activation of the MAPK pathway by CCR5 is distinct from that of other chemokine receptors, such as the CXCR4 receptor for SDF-1. The activation of the MAPK pathway by CCR5 is involved in the CCR5-mediated induction of actin polymerization and chemotaxis. The activation of the MAPK pathway by CCR5 may also play a role in the CCR5-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection. The activation of the MAPK pathway by CCR5 may also play a role in other cellular responses that are induced by CCR5, such as the induction of apoptosis. The activation of the MAPK pathway by CCR5 may also play a role in other cellular responses that are induced by other chemokine receptors, such as the induction of chemotaxis.

  "Fas (APO-1or CD9 5) is a cell surface receptor that induces apoptosis when bound by Fas ligand (FasL). The Fas-FasL interaction is involved in the regulation of immune responses, and defects in this interaction can lead to autoimmune disease. Binding of FasL to Fas activates the apoptotic signaling cascade through the caspase pathway. The Fas-induced apoptotic signal is transmitted through the adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated via death domain), which binds to the intracellular domain of Fas and recruits the initiator caspase, caspase-8 (FLICE). Caspase-8 activation occurs through autocatalysis and cleavage, and then activates downstream caspases, such as caspase-3, -6 and-7. Caspase-3 activation leads to the cleavage of a variety of cellular substrates, resulting in cellular disassembly. The Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is also activated by Fas signaling, and may contribute to apoptosis through the upregulation of Fas expression. The p21-activated kinase (PAK2) is also activated by Fas signaling, and may contribute to apoptosis through the phosphorylation of downstream targets.",
  "The transcription factor NF-kB is a key regulator of apoptosis and inflammation. The activation of NF-kB is involved in the cellular response to stress, cytokines, bacterial products, and viral infection. The activation of NF-kB is inhibited by its association with the inhibitor I-kB. The phosphorylation of I-kB by the I-kB kinase (IKK) complex leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of I-kB by the proteosome. The degradation of I-kB allows NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis. The activation of NF-kB by the HTLV-1 Tax protein is involved in the cellular transformation of T cells by HTLV-1. Tax activates NF-kB by three different mechanisms. First, Tax interacts with the IKK complex and activates its kinase activity. Second, Tax interacts with the I-kB kinase complex and causes the dissociation of the IKK complex. Third, Tax interacts with the CBP / p300 coactivator and causes its dissociation from NF-kB. The activation of NF-kB by Tax is involved in the cellular transformation of T cells by HTLV-1.",
  "RET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is activated by its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The RET receptor is expressed in neurons and in the kidney. Germline mutations in RET cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) and 2B (MEN 2B). MEN 2A is characterized by the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma (PHEO), and hyperparathyroidism (HPT). MEN2B is characterized by the presence of mucosal neuromas, marfanoid habitus, and PHEO. Somatic mutations in RET are found in > 5 0% of sporadic MTC. The most common mutation in MEN 2A and sporadic MTC is an in-frame duplication of one amino acid in codon 6 1 8 (TPM3). This mutation leads to constitutive dimerization and activation of RET. The MEN 2B mutation is a single base pair change in codon 9 1 8 (ATG1> ACG). This mutation results in a RET protein with a > 1 0 0-fold increase in kinase activity. Constitutive activation of RET leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cells. The MET oncogene is also a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The MET mutation that causes the germ line mutation in hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is also a constitutively active kinase. The MET mutation in HPRC leads to increased HGF binding and prolonged signaling. The constitutive activation of MET in HPRC leads to the development of multiple renal tumors.",
  "The E2F family of transcription factors plays a key role in regulating the progression of cells from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. The E2F family of proteins includes eight different genes that are divided into two groups based on sequence homology and functional similarity. The first group includes E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3a. These three genes encode proteins that act as transcriptional activators and are involved in the regulation of genes involved in DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. E2F3b and E2F3c are transcriptional repressors that oppose the action of the activators. The second group includes E2F4, E2F5 and E2F6. These three genes encode proteins that act as transcriptional repressors and are involved in the regulation of genes involved in differentiation. E2F7 and E2F8 are the newest members of the E2F family. E2F7 and E2F8 are transcriptional activators that appear to play a role in the control of cell proliferation during development.",
  "Rac GTPases are members of the Rho family of small G proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. They are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cell motility, membrane ruffling, cell cycle progression, and gene transcription. Rac proteins cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states, with the GDP-bound form being the inactive form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rac by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. GAPs inactivate Rac by stimulating the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind to the GDP-bound form of Rac and keep it in the cytosol. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors also inhibit the dissociation of GDP from Rac, keeping Rac in the inactive state in the absence of extracellular stimuli. Several GEFs and GAPs for Rac have been identified, but the regulation of these factors is not well understood. One of the best characterized Rac GEFs is Vav, which is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Another Rac GEF is Tiam-1, which is activated by the Rac-related protein Tiam-1. Another Rac GAP is p120GAP. Several Rac effectors have been identified. One of the first Rac effectors to be identified was PAK, a serine / threonine kinase. PAK interacts with Rac through a CRIB domain and phosphorylates downstream targets. One of the targets of PAK is p21, a Ras-related protein that stimulates Rac GEF activity. Another Rac effector is the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Rac also activates the MAP kinase pathways, including the JNK and ERK pathways. Rac also interacts with other small G proteins, such as Cdc 4 2 and Rho. Rac may also interact with other proteins to regulate its activity.",
  "The JAK / STAT pathway is a major signaling pathway used by cytokines to transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. The JAK / STAT pathway is used by a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors to transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. The JAK / STAT pathway is used by a number of cytokines including IL-6, IL-1 0, LIF, CNTF, OSM, and IFN-gamma. The JAK proteins are a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that are activated by cytokine receptors. Binding of cytokine to its receptor activates the JAK kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the STAT proteins. Activated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of target genes. The SOCS proteins are a family of proteins that act as cytokine inducible negative regulators of the JAK / STAT pathway. The SOCS proteins are induced by cytokine signaling and then bind to the JAK kinases or activated STATs to inhibit further signaling.",
  "Bradykinin (BK) is a nonapeptide formed by the enzymatic degradation of high molecular weight kininogen. BK is a potent vasodilator and a potent stimulator of permeability in the microcirculation. The BK receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor that is coupled to phospholipase C and inositol phosphate formation. The vascular endothelial cell BK receptor is a heterodimer consisting of the B1and B2Rs. The B1R is coupled to Gq / 1 1 and activation of phospholipase C, whereas the B2R is coupled to Gi / o and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The B2R is also coupled to phospholipase A2. The B2R is also coupled to the tyrosine kinase Src and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The B1R is coupled to Gq / 1 1 and activation of phospholipase C. The B1R and B2R are widely distributed in the body and are involved in a variety of physiological processes. The B1R is constitutively expressed in the lung, brain, and kidney. The B2R is constitutively expressed in the lung and is induced in the kidney and other tissues by inflammatory stimuli. The B2R is also expressed in the brain. The B1R is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, whereas the B2R is involved in the inflammatory response. The B1R is involved in the regulation of vascular permeability and edema formation in the lung.",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved DNA repair mechanism that corrects DNA replication errors, including insertion-deletion mismatches and some forms of DNA damage. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication to maintain genomic stability. MMR also recognizes and repairs some forms of DNA damage, including O 6 -methylguanine (O 6 -MeG) generated by SN1 alkylating agents. Defects in MMR increase mutation rates and are associated with cancer predisposition in humans. In Escherichia coli, MMR is initiated by MutS, which recognizes and binds to mismatches. MutL activates the MutH endonuclease, which incises the unmethylated daughter strand at hemimethylated d (GATC) sites. UvrD helicase and exonuclease I nick the gap, and DNA polymerase III and DNA ligase complete repair. In eukaryotes, MMR is initiated by MutS\u03b1 (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS\u03b2 (MSH2-MSH3), which bind to mismatches. MutL\u03b1 (MLH1-PMS2) or MutL\u03b2 (MLH1-PMS1) activates the UvrD helicase and exonuclease I to repair the mismatch. In addition to MMR, MutS and MutL homologs play important roles in other DNA repair pathways and in genome stability through their interactions with other factors.",
  "The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against microbial pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the pattern recognition receptors that recognize microbial components and activate innate immune responses. Mammalian TLRs are expressed in various cell types including macrophages, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts. They are characterized by an extracellular domain containing leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. TLRs are expressed on the cell surface or in intracellular compartments. Upon ligand recognition, TLRs recruit an adaptor protein MyD8 8 through the TIR domain. MyD8 8 in turn activates a set of downstream signaling molecules, including interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) -6, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). These signaling events lead to induction of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. IRAK-4 is a negative regulator of TLR signaling. Mice deficient in IRAK-4 are hyper-responsive to TLR ligands and exhibit increased susceptibility to infection.",
  "B cell receptor (BCR) activation is essential for the maturation and survival of B cells. BCR activation initiates a complex signaling cascade that leads to the activation of B cells. The BCR complex is composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) and Ig-alpha / Ig-beta heterodimer. The Ig-alpha / Ig-beta heterodimer is associated with the heterodimer of Igalpha and Igbeta. The cytoplasmic domain of Ig-alpha contains two tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated upon BCR activation. The phosphorylation of these tyrosines creates binding sites for the SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules. The tyrosine kinase Lyn is the first kinase to be activated upon BCR activation. Lyn phosphorylates the Ig-alpha / Ig-beta heterodimer, which in turn recruits and activates the tyrosine kinase Syk. The activation of Syk leads to the activation of downstream pathways, including the phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma 2) pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the NF-AT pathway.",
  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is a key signaling pathway that is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The PKA pathway is activated by a variety of extracellular signals, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors. The binding of these ligands to their respective cell surface receptors results in the activation of adenylate cyclase, which synthesizes cAMP from ATP. The intracellular concentration of cAMP is regulated by the opposing actions of adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterases. The binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits of PKA results in the release of the catalytic subunits, which are then free to phosphorylate downstream targets. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. There are four regulatory subunits (RIalpha, RIbeta, RIIalpha, and RIIbeta) and four catalytic subunits (Calpha, Cbeta, Cgamma, and Prkx). The PKA regulatory subunits bind four molecules of cAMP, whereas the catalytic subunits have no regulatory function on their own. The PKA regulatory subunits are encoded by two genes, Prkar1a and Prkar1b, and the PKA catalytic subunits are encoded by three genes, Prkaca, Prkacb, and Prkx. cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits, causing a conformational change that releases the catalytic subunits. The catalytic subunits are then free to phosphorylate downstream targets. The PKA catalytic subunits are encoded by three genes, Prkaca, Prkacb, and Prkx. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that is activated by PKA. Phosphorylation of CREB by PKA results in the binding of CREB to the cAMP-response element (CRE), which in turn activates the transcription of genes containing the CRE. The PKA regulatory subunit RIIbeta has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene, and loss of this gene leads to the formation of tumors in a variety of tissues. The PKA catalytic subunit Calpha has been shown to be a proto-oncogene. The Prkar1a gene encodes a PKA regulatory subunit that inhibits the activity of the PKA catalytic subunits. Loss of this gene results in increased PKA activity and increased cellular proliferation. The Prkar1b gene encodes a PKA regulatory subunit that is less sensitive to inhibition by PKA regulatory subunits. Loss of this gene also results in increased cellular proliferation, but this effect is independent of PKA activity. The E1a gene of adenovirus encodes a protein that binds to the p300 family of PKA regulatory subunits and inhibits their ability to inhibit PKA activity. The E1a protein of adenovirus also binds to the CBP / p300 transcriptional coactivators and stimulates the activity of CREB. The interaction of adenovirus E1a with the p300 transcriptional coactivators may provide a useful tool for studying the role of these coactivators in transcriptional regulation.",
  "The protein translocation channel in the inner membrane of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum is formed by the heterotrimeric complex Sec6 1alpha-Sec61beta. The channel is the primary route for the transport of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The channel is gated by a lateral gate formed by the membrane protein Sec61. The translocation channel is a component of the protein-conducting membrane-bound Sec complex. The Sec complex is a highly conserved protein transport machinery found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The Sec complex is associated with the translocon, a protein-conducting channel in the membrane of the ER. The translocon is formed by the heterotrimeric membrane protein Sec6 1alpha-Sec61beta-Sec12beta. The translocon is the main channel for the passive transport of proteins into the ER. The transport of proteins into the ER is coupled to their posttranslational translocation. Proteins that have not yet acquired their correct three-dimensional structure are transported into the ER via the so-called cotranslational translocation pathway. Proteins are targeted to the translocon via the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SR). The SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex is recognized by the SRP receptor and the ribosome is transferred to the membrane-bound translocon. The ribosome-bound signal sequence is recognized by the docking complex Sec2221beta, the docking complex Sec2221beta is a heterodimer of the membrane proteins Sec2221beta and Sec2222beta. The ribosome-bound nascent chain is then transferred to the translocation channel. The channel is formed by the trimeric complex Sec6 1alpha-Sec61beta-Sec12beta.",
  "Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that promotes the survival and differentiation of neurons. NGF binds to TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, and activates signaling pathways that regulate neuronal survival and differentiation. The NGF / TrkA signaling pathway also plays a role in the development and function of other tissues and cells.",
  "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABA is released from presynaptic terminals and binds to GABA (A) receptors on the surface of the postsynaptic neuron. The GABA (A) receptor is a ligand-gated chloride ion channel that is activated by GABA. GABA (A) receptors are pentamers and are classified into three different subunit types: alpha, beta, and gamma. The GABA (A) receptor is a major target of many clinically important drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and general anesthetics. GABA (A) receptors are also the site of action of many drugs of abuse, including ethanol. GABA (A) receptors are also targets of drugs that are anxiogenic or cause memory impairment, such as the anxiogenic drug diazepam and the general anesthetic etomidate. The activity of GABA (A) receptors is regulated by a number of proteins, including GABA (A) receptor-associated proteins (GABARAPs). GABARAPs interact with the intracellular domain of the GABA (A) receptor and may regulate the number of receptors on the cell surface. The GABARAP family of proteins includes GABARAP, Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 1 8kDa (GATE1 8), and light chain 3 (LC3II) of microtubule-associated proteins 1 and 2. GABARAP and GATE1 8 are involved in intracellular vesicle transport and may be involved in the transport of GABA (A) receptors to the cell surface. The interaction of GABARAP with the GABA (A) receptor is regulated by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein. GABARAP is covalently modified by SUMO, and the modification of GABARAP by SUMO is required for the interaction of GABARAP with the GABA (A) receptor. GABARAP is also modified by ubiquitin, but the functional significance of this modification is not known. GABARAP is also involved in the transport of GABAA receptors to the cell surface in neurons. The transport of GABA (A) receptors to the cell surface in neurons may be regulated by phosphorylation of GABARAP by the protein kinase casein kinase II (CK2). The transport of GABA (A) receptors to the cell surface in neurons may be regulated by phosphorylation of GABARAP by CK2. The transport of GABA (A) receptors to the cell surface in neurons may be regulated by phosphorylation of GABARAP by CK2. The transport of GABA (A) receptors to the cell surface in neurons may be regulated by phosphorylation of GABARAP by CK2. The transport of GABA (A) receptors to the cell surface in neurons may be regulated by phosphorylation of GABARAP by CK2.",
  "The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex that is activated by increased AMP / ATP ratio in cells. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates and thereby inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis. It also phosphorylates and stimulates the activity of the glucose transporter GLUT4, leading to increased glucose uptake into cells and increased glycogen storage. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates and thereby inactivates HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. These effects of AMPK activation are consistent with the observed increase in fatty acid oxidation and a decrease in fatty acid synthesis in response to AMPK activation. In addition, AMPK activation increases glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. These effects of AMPK activation are consistent with the observed increase in glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in response to AMPK activation in skeletal muscle. The anti-diabetic drug metformin activates AMPK in liver and skeletal muscle, and this may contribute to the glucose-lowering effects of metformin.",
  "The G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle is a critical regulatory checkpoint that must be carefully controlled to prevent unscheduled cell proliferation. The G1 to S phase transition is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are in turn regulated by the CDK inhibitors (CKIs). The CKI proteins include the INK4 family (p16, p15, p18, and p19) and the Cip / Kip family (p16, p18, and p19). The INK4 family of inhibitors specifically inhibit the CDK4 and CDK6 kinases, while the Cip / Kip family of inhibitors inhibit the activities of the cyclin D1, cyclin E, and CDK2 kinases. The INK4 and Cip / Kip families of CKIs are all regulated by the Rb tumor suppressor gene. The Rb gene is regulated transcriptionally by the E2F transcription factors, and the Rb protein binds to the E2F transcription factors and represses their transcriptional activity. When the Rb gene is mutated or deleted, the E2F factors become constitutively active, inducing the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication. The INK4 and Cip / Kip families of CKIs are regulated at the level of transcription. The p16 and p19 proteins are induced by and are required for growth arrest induced by the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The p18 and p15 proteins are induced by the activated Ras oncogene, and these proteins inhibit the formation of the cyclin D-CDK4 and CDK6 complexes, thereby inhibiting cell cycle progression. The Ras oncogene also induces the expression of the p21 protein, which inhibits the formation of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, further inhibiting cell cycle progression.",
  "Cell cycle progression through the G1 phase is regulated by the cyclin D-cdk4 / 6 complex, which phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), releasing the transcription factor E2F-1. E2F-1 induces the expression of genes required for S-phase entry, including cyclin E, which activates cdk2 and p53. The induction of p53 by E2F-1 also contributes to the induction of p53 by E2F-1. The activation of p53 by E2F-1 leads to a positive feedback loop that reinforces the activation of E2F-1 and p53. The induction of p53 by E2F-1 is required for the S-phase entry and cell cycle progression.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a highly conserved signaling cascade that is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. The MAPK pathway is activated by growth factor receptors and by the small G protein Ras. Growth factor receptors activate the small G protein RAS, which activates the RAF / MEK / ERK kinase cascade. The BRAF gene is mutated in a high percentage of melanomas, and these mutations result in the constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The BRAF mutation is an early event in melanomagenesis, as it is found in dysplastic nevi. The NRAS mutation is found in both primary and metastatic melanomas, suggesting that it is an early event in melanomagenesis. The CDKN2A gene encodes two proteins, p16INK4A and p14ARF, that regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis. The p16INK4A protein inhibits the cell cycle by blocking the action of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The p14ARF protein binds to MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase that targets p5 3 for degradation, and stabilizes p5 3. Mutations in the CDKN2A gene are found in a high percentage of melanomas, and these mutations lead to the loss of p16INK4A and p14ARF. The activation of the MAPK pathway by the BRAF mutation and the loss of p16INK4A and p14ARF allow the cell cycle to progress unchecked.",
  "The cadherin-catenin complex is a key mediator of cell-cell adhesion. The cadherin-catenin complex is localized at adherens junctions, where it interacts with the actin cytoskeleton. The cadherin-catenin complex is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through alpha-catenin. The cadherin-catenin complex is linked to the extracellular matrix through integrins. The cadherin-catenin complex is also linked to the APC tumor suppressor protein. The APC tumor suppressor protein is linked to beta-catenin through the scaffold protein axin. The APC tumor suppressor protein is linked to beta-catenin through the scaffold protein conductin. The scaffold protein axin also interacts with the protein kinase GSK-3. The scaffold protein axin also interacts with the protein kinase GSK-3. The scaffold protein axin is part of a multiprotein complex that targets beta-catenin for phosphorylation and degradation by the proteosome. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin by GSK-3 targets it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin by GSK-3 is inhibited by Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling inhibits the phosphorylation of beta-catenin by GSK-3, stabilizing beta-catenin and allowing it to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, beta-catenin interacts with the TCF / LEF transcription factors to activate genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. CTNND1 (catenin delta 1) is a member of the catenin gene family. CTNND1 is localized to chromosome 1q4 2. 3. CTNND1 encodes for delta-catenin, a member of the catenin gene family. CTNND1 is expressed in the developing brain and is upregulated in the adult brain. CTNND1 is upregulated in some cancers, including melanoma, breast, and prostate. The delta-catenin protein is localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. CTNND1 interacts with the cadherin-catenin complex and may play a role in cell-cell adhesion.",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to harmful stimuli such as infection. The inflammatory response is initiated by the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF from activated macrophages. The inflammatory cytokines activate endothelial cells, which express adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, P-selectin, and VCAM-1. These adhesion molecules mediate the attachment of leukocytes to the activated endothelium and their subsequent migration into the tissue. The migration of leukocytes into the tissue is regulated by chemokines such as IL-8 and CXCL-1. The activation of endothelial cells by cytokines also leads to the production of kinins, a group of peptides that cause vasodilation and increase vascular permeability. Kinins are released from kininogen by the protease activity of plasma kallikrein. Kininogen is cleaved by plasma kallikrein and factor XII to release bradykinin, a peptide that causes the pain of the inflammatory response. The release of bradykinin also activates the release of the hypotensive hormone vasopressin. The release of bradykinin by the inflammatory response may also act as a feedback mechanism to increase the inflammatory response.",
  "The chemokine receptor CCR5 is expressed on macrophages and T cells and is involved in the immune response to infection. The chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) binds to CCR5 and activates signaling pathways that lead to chemotaxis, actin reorganization, and other cellular responses. The signaling pathways downstream of CCR5 include the small G proteins Rac and Rho, the p38 MAP kinase pathway, and the small G protein kinase PAK. The p38 MAP kinase pathway is involved in actin reorganization and is activated by CCR5 through both the small G proteins Rac and Rho and the small G protein kinase PAK. The small G protein kinase PAK is involved in the regulation of p38 and is activated by Rac and Cdc4 2. The chemokine receptor CCR5 also activates the small G protein RhoA, which is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and is involved in cell migration. The activation of RhoA by CCR5 is independent of the p38 pathway and is mediated by the small G protein Rac. The activation of Rac and RhoA by CCR5 is independent of phospholipase C and calcium flux, but is dependent on the G protein subunit alpha q. The activation of Rac and RhoA by CCR5 is involved in cellular responses such as actin reorganization and chemotaxis.",
  "Interleukin-1 8 (IL-18) is a cytokine that induces the production of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and other cytokines and is a key mediator of inflammation. IL-18 is a 1 8kDa protein that is cleaved to a 70 amino acid form that is secreted. IL-18 signals through a cell-surface receptor that is distinct from the IL-1receptor and signals through a pathway that includes the kinases map kinase 8 and map kinase 26, the transcription factor STAT-4, and the transcription factor IRF-1. IL-18 signals through the IL-1receptor-like complex and the Jak / Stat pathway used by IL-12. IL-18 also induces the expression of the IL-1receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), which competes with IL-18 for the IL-1receptor. IL-18 is an important mediator of inflammation and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are involved in the recognition and lysis of cells that display abnormal expression of MHC-I or display some otherwise normal self-molecules. NK cells do not express antigen receptors of the immunoglobulin gene family but do express a variety of receptors that are involved in the regulation of NK cell activation. These receptors include activating receptors that trigger NK cell cytotoxicity, such as the receptors for MHC-I-specific or -non-specific killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), the activating lectin-like receptors (e.g., NKG2D), and the CD9 4-NKG2A heterodimer. Inhibitory receptors that are specific for MHC-I molecules, such as the killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) -1or the leukocyte Ig-like receptor (LIR) -1, block NK cell activation. Activating and inhibitory receptors are often co-expressed on the same cell, and the balance of signals from these receptors determines the activation or inhibition of the cell. NK cell activation is triggered by engagement of activating receptors and is inhibited by engagement of MHC-I-specific inhibitory receptors. NK cell cytotoxicity is triggered by the release of perforin and granzyme B, which leads to the formation of pores in the membrane of the targeted cell and the activation of caspases.",
  "Taste perception is a complex process that involves the interaction of many molecules. The sense of taste is mediated by taste receptors located in the oral cavity. These receptors are stimulated by tastants, which are molecules that elicit a taste, and result in the activation of specific signaling pathways that lead to the perception of a taste. The transduction pathways activated by taste receptors are diverse and include the activation of ion channels, second messenger pathways, and the release of neurotransmitters. The transduction pathways activated by sweet, umami, and bitter compounds converge on the activation of gustducin, a G protein alpha subunit that is specific to taste cells. The activation of gustducin leads to the inhibition of the TRPM5 ion channel and the subsequent inhibition of the sweet, umami, and bitter transduction pathways. The activation of these transduction pathways by tastants is also modulated by the presence of other signaling molecules. The activation of the tastant receptors by amino acids is modulated by the binding of glutamate to the mGluR4 receptor. The activation of the tastant receptors by sour compounds is modulated by the presence of bicarbonate ions. The transduction pathways activated by the tastant receptors by acids are not yet known.",
  "Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia. HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of HIF-1alpha and ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) subunits. HIF-1 binds to a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the promoters of many genes, increasing their expression in hypoxia. HIF-1 is also stabilized by the hypoxia mimetic agent desferrioxamine (DFX). HIF-1 is degraded in the presence of oxygen by the proteosome, but in the absence of oxygen HIF-1 is stabilized. HIF-1 is regulated by oxygen through post-translational hydroxylation of specific proline residues in HIF-1 by a family of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) targets hydroxylated HIF-1 for degradation by the proteosome. The hydroxylation of HIF-1 by PHDs requires oxygen, iron, and 2-oxoglutarate. HIF-1 is also regulated by nitric oxide (NO). NO stabilizes HIF-1 through a mechanism that does not require the VHL protein. HIF-1 induces the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and vasomotor control. HIF-1 may play a role in tumor growth by stimulating angiogenesis and by increasing oxygen delivery to the tumor. HIF-1 may also play a role in the response of the body to hypoxia.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women. The 5year survival rate for breast cancer patients is 9 0% for patients with localized disease, but only 2 3% for patients with metastatic disease. The metastatic spread of breast cancer cells is a complex process that involves multiple steps, including local invasion, intravasation, circulation, extravasation, and growth at a distant site. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of macromolecules that provides structural support and regulates cell behavior. The degradation of the ECM by tumor cells is essential for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Cathepsin D is a lysosomal aspartic protease that degrades the ECM and is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Cathepsin D is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and is secreted into the extracellular space. Secreted cathepsin D activates the protease meprin, a metalloprotease, and the protease MMP-2, a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. Meprin and MMP-2 degrade ECM components and basement membranes, allowing tumor cells to invade local tissues and metastasize. Cathepsin D also activates the protease plasmin, which in turn activates MMP-2. Meprin and MMP-2 are upregulated in breast tumors and are associated with tumor progression and metastasis. The interaction of breast tumor cells with the ECM is also regulated by cell adhesion molecules. E-cadherin is a transmembrane protein that mediates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Loss of E-cadherin expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. The transcription factor snail represses E-cadherin expression, increasing tumor cell motility and invasiveness. The transcription factor twist represses the expression of the tight junction protein occludin, increasing tumor cell motility and invasiveness. The expression of the metastasis-associated protein 1gene (MTA1) is associated with tumor metastasis. MTA1 interacts with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to repress the transcription of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), a key regulator of breast cancer progression. Loss of ER-alpha expression in breast cancer cells results in a loss of estrogen-dependent growth and a shift to estrogen-independent growth mediated by the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase HER2. The HER2 pathway activates the transcription of the gene encoding the protease cathepsin D, which in turn activates meprin and MMP-2. The activation of meprin and MMP-2 by cathepsin D and HER2 leads to degradation of the ECM and increased tumor cell motility and metastasis.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily contains more than 6 0 members and is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, and immune responses. The Fas receptor (also called APO1, CD9 5, and TNFRSF6) is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that induces apoptosis in response to binding its ligand, Fas-ligand (also called APO1-ligand). Fas-ligand is expressed on the surface of immune cells and binds to Fas on the surface of other cells, triggering apoptosis in the latter. Mice lacking Fas-ligand or Fas are highly resistant to the induction of apoptosis by cytotoxic T cells, and are prone to autoimmune disease. The importance of Fas-mediated apoptosis in immune regulation is demonstrated by the fact that many cancers and virus-infected cells down-regulate Fas expression to escape immune surveillance.

  "The interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium is an important step in inflammation and the immune response. The first step in this interaction is the adhesion of the leukocyte to the endothelium. This adhesion is mediated by a family of adhesion molecules called selectins. The selectin family includes the E-selectin (CD6 2E), P-selectin (CD6 2P), and L-selectin (CD6 2L). The selectin family members are found on the surface of leukocytes and endothelial cells and are involved in the initial adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium.

  "Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a polypeptide hormone that has a variety of effects on growth and development. IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor and stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. The IGF-1 receptor activates several signaling pathways including the ras / p180GAP / MAPK pathway, the PI3 kinase pathway and the JAK / STAT pathway. The ras / p180GAP / MAPK pathway is activated by the binding of growth factors to their receptors and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Raf1. Raf1 phosphorylates and activates MEK1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1 and ERK2. The PI3 kinase pathway is activated by growth factor receptors and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt / PKB. Akt / PKB is a serine / threonine kinase that has been shown to play a role in cell survival. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by growth factor receptors and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT transcription factors.",
  "The Krebs cycle is a central pathway of aerobic metabolism that produces NADH and FADH2 to drive the electron transport chain and produce energy in the form of a proton gradient. The cycle is also a major source of cellular precursors, such as 2-oxoglutarate, which is used as a precursor for amino acids and other compounds. The cycle begins with acetyl-CoA, which is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by the action of pyruvate carboxylase, which also acts as a regulatory enzyme. Acetyl-CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA by the combined action of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. Squalene is converted to isoprene by the addition of two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate. The next step in the cycle is the conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate by the enzyme aconitase. The next four steps are the same as those in the classical Krebs cycle, but with different enzymes. Succinyl-CoA is converted to fumarate by the sequential addition of the remaining three-carbon compounds of acetyl-CoA. The cycle ends with the conversion of carbon dioxide to the one-carbon compound, which is released as carbon dioxide.",
  "The cell cycle is a series of coordinated events that lead to the duplication of cellular DNA and the subsequent division of the cell into two daughter cells. The cell cycle is regulated by a complex network of proteins that include cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). The cyclin-CDK complex is inactive until it is phosphorylated by the CDK activating kinase (CAK) at threonine 1 60 and by the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) at threonine 161. Once activated, the cyclin-CDK complex phosphorylates downstream targets that lead to the G1 to S phase transition. The G1 to S phase transition is also regulated by the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). When unphosphorylated, Rb binds to E2F transcription factors and represses transcription of genes involved in DNA synthesis. Phosphorylation of Rb by the cyclin-CDK complex releases E2F, allowing transcription of genes involved in S phase progression. The G2 to M phase transition is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 (CDC2). The activity of CDK1 is regulated by the checkpoint kinase CHK1 and WEE1 kinases. When activated, CHK1 and WEE1 phosphorylate and inhibit CDK1. DNA damage activates the ATM and ATR kinases, which in turn activate CHK1 and WEE1. Activated CHK1 and WEE1 phosphorylate and inhibit CDK1, halting the cell cycle and providing more time for the DNA repair machinery to correct the damage. Defects in the DNA damage checkpoint can lead to genomic instability and cancer.",
  "The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved mechanism of intercellular communication that plays a key role in development. The Notch receptor is a single-pass transmembrane protein. The ligands Delta and Jagged / Serrate are transmembrane proteins. Binding of the ligand to the Notch receptor induces two proteolytic cleavages that release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1, Su (H), Lag-1) and other transcriptional activators or co-activators. The NICD-CSL complex activates transcription of Notch target genes, including those involved in cell fate decisions. The first step in Notch signaling is ligand binding. This can occur in the ER or at the cell surface. The first cleavage is mediated by a metalloprotease and the second by gamma-secretase. The metalloprotease is TACE (TNF-alpha converting enzyme).

  "The Rho GTPases are a subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that includes the Ras, Rac, and Cdc-4 proteins. The Rho GTPases regulate a variety of cellular functions, including the formation of actin stress fibers, the formation of focal adhesions, and the regulation of cell motility. The Rho GTPases are active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. The conversion of the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form is regulated by three classes of proteins: Guanine Exchange Factors (GEFs) that catalyze the release of GDP and the association of GTP; GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rho protein; and Guanine Dissociation Inhibitors (GDIs) that bind to the inactive Rho-GDP complex and inhibit the release of GDP and the association of GTP. The Dbl family of GEFs are the largest class of Rho GEFs, with more than 8 0 members in the human genome. The Dbl family GEFs contain a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain and an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The Dbl family GEFs are regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including the interaction of the PH domain with phosphoinositides, phosphorylation by protein kinases, and interaction with other proteins. The Dbl family GEFs are further regulated by the presence or absence of additional domains. The Dbl family GEFs are further divided into two broad groups: those that act on only one Rho GTPase (e.g., Vav, Dbl, Lfc, and Vav-2) and those that act on more than one Rho GTPase (e.g., Ect2, Tiam1, and TrioGEF). The downstream signaling pathways of the Rho GTPases are not well characterized, but appear to be specific for each Rho GTPase. For example, the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) is a downstream effector of Rho and regulates the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. ROCK also phosphorylates and activates LIMK, which phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing protein. The Dia1 and Dia2 proteins are Rho-activated kinases that regulate the formation of actin filaments and focal adhesions. The p140 isoform of myosin II is also regulated by the Rho GTPases. The ERM proteins (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin) are involved in the formation of actin-membrane interactions and are regulated by the Rho GTPases. The p140 isoform of myosin II is involved in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. The interaction of integrins with the extracellular matrix activates signaling pathways that lead to the activation of the Rho GTPases and the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. The Rho GTPases also play a role in cell motility. The formation of lamellipodia and filopodia is involved in the extension of the cell membrane and the formation of the leading edge of a cell, while the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers is involved in the retraction of the cell and the formation of the trailing edge of a cell. The Rho GTPases are involved in cell motility through their regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac and Cdc4 2 stimulate the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, while the activation of Rho stimulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. The interaction of integrins with the extracellular matrix activates signaling pathways that lead to the activation of Rac and Cdc4 2, which stimulate the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, while the interaction of integrins with the extracellular matrix activates pathways that activate Rho, which stimulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. The interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix also activates signaling pathways that activate FAK and paxillin, which are involved in the formation of focal adhesions. The activation of Rac and Cdc4 2 stimulates the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, while the activation of Rho stimulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. The activation of Rac and Cdc4 2 stimulates the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, while the activation of Rho stimulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled form of cell death that plays a key role in the removal of damaged cells and the regulation of cell numbers. Two major pathways of apoptosis have been identified: the extrinsic (receptor-mediated) pathway and the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathway. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the binding of ligands to cell surface receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, such as Fas / APO1, and involves the activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates caspase-3, -6 and -7, which directly cleave cellular proteins and cause the morphological changes associated with apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and growth factor withdrawal, and leads to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which activates caspase-9. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, -6 and -7. The cleavage of cellular substrates by caspases leads to the morphological changes associated with apoptosis.",
  "The dopamine D2 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase and reduces cAMP levels. The cAMP pathway is involved in a variety of physiological processes including learning and memory. The dopamine D2 receptor is expressed in medium spiny neurons of the striatum where it inhibits the activity of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. The PKA pathway is involved in the phosphorylation of DARPP-32, a protein that inhibits the activity of the protein phosphatase PP-1. The inhibition of PP-1 by DARPP-32 results in an increase in the phosphorylation of a variety of substrates including the ion channel GluR1 and the dopamine D1 receptor. The inhibition of the PKA pathway by the dopamine D2 receptor also results in a decrease in the phosphorylation of CREB and a decrease in the expression of CRE-regulated genes. The dopamine D2 receptor also inhibits the activity of the phospholipase C pathway. The inhibition of phospholipase C by the dopamine D2 receptor is mediated by the pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein Go. The inhibition of phospholipase C by the dopamine D2 receptor results in a decrease in the levels of IP3 and diacylglycerol and a decrease in the activation of protein kinase C. The inhibition of the phospholipase C pathway by the dopamine D2 receptor also results in a decrease in the phosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit.",
  "The immune system is comprised of cells that respond to infection and inflammation. Neutrophils are a key component of the immune system, and are recruited to sites of infection and inflammation by a variety of signals. One of the signals that recruits neutrophils to sites of inflammation is the interaction of the chemokine IL-8 with its receptor. IL-8 is a member of a family of chemokines that includes Gro-alpha, Gro-beta, and NAP-2. The IL-8 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, and is expressed on the surface of neutrophils. The interaction of IL-8 with its receptor causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores, and the activation of the neutrophil. The activation of the neutrophil causes the release of reactive oxygen species, the destruction of bacteria, and the formation of a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET). The NET is a web of DNA that is released from the activated neutrophil, and acts as a trap for bacteria. The interaction of IL-8 with its receptor also causes the chemotaxis of neutrophils to the site of inflammation. The interaction of IL-8 with its receptor is also involved in the activation of other cell types, including T cells and endothelial cells. The interaction of IL-8 with its receptor also causes the down regulation of the receptor, helping to turn off the response to IL-8. The interaction of IL-8 with its receptor is a key step in the immune response to infection and inflammation. The interaction of IL-8 with its receptor is a good target for the development of drugs to treat inflammatory conditions.",
  "The regulation of the activity of DARPP-32 is complex and involves multiple signaling pathways. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr75by PKA results in a conversion of DARPP-32 from an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) to an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A). The inhibition of PP2A by DARPP-32 results in the activation of the cdk5 / p35 kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of a number of downstream targets including the neurofilaments, the transcription factor, histone H3, and the microtubule associated protein, tau. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr75by PKA also results in the inhibition of the dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr = 32, 0 0 0 (DARPP-3 2), a potent inhibitor of PKA. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr75by Cdk5 / p35 results in a reversal of the inhibition of PKA and the subsequent activation of PKA.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is activated by detecting conserved molecular patterns present in microbes, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), but not in the host cells. Viral nucleic acids are recognized by two classes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic RNA helicases, including RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. Upon recognition of viral nucleic acids, these receptors trigger signaling cascades that lead to the production of type I interferon (IFN) and other cytokines. Secreted IFN induces an antiviral state in infected cells and in neighboring cells through the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the expression of a large set of genes with antiviral functions.",
  "Leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium is a key step in the inflammatory response. During inflammation, leukocytes are recruited from the bloodstream into tissues in response to inflammatory signals. The initial step in this process is the rolling of leukocytes on the vascular endothelium. This is mediated by the interaction of selectins on the leukocyte surface with P- and E-selectin on the vascular endothelium. After rolling, leukocytes are activated and adhere to the endothelium via integrins. This step is mediated by the interaction of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) on the leukocyte with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the vascular endothelium. Other adhesion molecules such as PECAM-1 and VLA-4 also play a role in this step. After adhesion, leukocytes leave the vasculature and enter tissues. This step is mediated by PECAM-1 and PECAM-1 dependent signaling.",
  "Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine that is required for the development and function of T cells. The IL-7 receptor is composed of two polypeptide chains, the alpha chain (CD12 7) that is specific for IL-7 and the beta chain (CD25) that is shared with IL-2 and IL-1 5. The CD25 chain is unique to the IL-7 receptor and is required for signaling by IL-7. The activation of the JAK / STAT pathway by IL-7 is similar to that of IL-2 and IL-1 5. The JAK / STAT pathway includes activation of the JAK kinases, phosphorylation of the IL-7Ralpha chain, phosphorylation of the beta chain, activation of the STAT transcription factors, and induction of gene expression. The JAK kinases phosphorylate the IL-7Ralpha chain and the beta chain. The JAK kinases also phosphorylate the STAT transcription factors, STAT5a and STAT5b, that are activated by IL-7. The activation of the JAK / STAT pathway by IL-7 is similar to that of IL-2 and IL-1 5. The src family kinase, Lck, associates with the CD25 chain of the IL-7 receptor and is required for activation of the JAK kinases and the STAT transcription factors. The activation of Lck also leads to phosphorylation of the IL-7Ralpha chain and may contribute to the activation of the JAK / STAT pathway. The activation of Lck also leads to phosphorylation of the p300protein and the PI3 kinase pathway. The PI3 kinase pathway may contribute to the activation of the JAK / STAT pathway by IL-7. The activation of Lck and the PI3 kinase pathway may also contribute to the survival and proliferation of T cells by IL-7.",
  "The transcription factor NFAT is a key regulator of cytokine gene expression in T cells. The activity of NFAT is regulated by the phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and activate transcription. The activity of calcineurin is regulated by calcium, which is increased by the TCR. The activity of calcineurin is also regulated by the kinases GSK-3 and PKA, and by the phosphatase calcineurin itself. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The transcription factor Sp1 also regulates cytokine gene expression in T cells, and interacts with NFAT to activate transcription synergistically. The interaction of NFAT and Sp1 is mediated by the transcription factor Sp3, which also interacts with NFAT. The interaction of NFAT and Sp1 is regulated by the kinase PKA, and by the phosphatase calcineurin. The interaction of NFAT and Sp1 is also regulated by the kinase PKC. The interaction of NFAT and Sp1 is also regulated by calmodulin. The interaction of NFAT and Sp1 is a key regulatory mechanism in T cells, and may also play a role in other cell types where these transcription factors are expressed.",
  "Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins that are secreted by epithelial cells. They are involved in a number of important functions including lubrication, protection from harmful agents, and cell signalling. The trefoil factor (TFF) family of peptides are small secreted proteins that are up-regulated in mucosal injury and repair. They are involved in mucosal restitution and repair and are potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of mucosal injury. The trefoil factors are characterized by the presence of three conserved cysteine residues that form intramolecular disulphide bonds. The three trefoil factors (pS2, spasmolytic polypeptide; TFF1, trefoil factor 1; TFF2, trefoil factor 2) are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and are up-regulated in mucosal injury. TFF1 and TFF2 knockout mice have abnormal mucosal healing and TFF1 is down-regulated in gastric cancer. The trefoil factors are secreted onto the mucosal surface as a disulphide-linked dimer. The trefoil factors are mitogenic for a number of epithelial cell types and may act as motogens. The trefoil factors may also act as motogens in the gastrointestinal tract by stimulating the restitution of the epithelium. The trefoil factors may also act as mucosal protective agents by increasing the resistance of the epithelium to damage. The mechanism of action of the trefoil factors is not yet clear, but may involve activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The trefoil factors may act as EGFR ligands, activating the EGFR and downstream signalling pathways. The trefoil factors may also activate the EGFR by a mechanism involving the induction of the EGFR ligand heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). The trefoil factors may also act as motogens by inducing the expression of HB-EGF. The trefoil factors may also act as mucosal protective agents by inducing mucin secretion. The trefoil factors may also act as motogens by inducing the expression of mucin genes.",
  "The inflammatory response is a complex series of events that involves the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation, their activation, and their subsequent migration to the site of inflammation. The initial step in this cascade is the rapid recruitment of leukocytes from the blood to the site of inflammation. This is accomplished by the rolling of leukocytes along the vascular endothelium, mediated by the interaction of the leukocyte adhesion molecule, P-selectin, with its ligand, P-selectin Glycoprotein, on the endothelium. Upon activation, leukocytes express a variety of adhesion molecules, including Mac-1 (alphaMbeta2, CD11b / CD1 8), LFA-1 (alphaLbeta2, CD11a / CD1 8), and VLA-4 (alpha4beta1, CD14b1 / CD18), that mediate their firm adhesion to endothelium and subsequent migration of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue. This cascade of events is tightly regulated by a variety of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators.",
  "The transcription factor NF-kB is involved in the regulation of many genes involved in the immune response, cell growth and apoptosis. The NF-kB family of transcription factors is formed by dimerization of the products of the NFKB1 (p5 0), NFKB2 (p5 2), RELA (p6 5), and REL (c-Rel) genes. The p5 0 and p5 2 proteins are synthesized from the NFKB1 and NFKB2 genes, respectively, and lack a transcriptional activation domain. The other two proteins, p6 5 and c-Rel, contain a transcriptional activation domain and are responsible for the transcriptional activity of the NF-kB complex. In the inactive state, NF-kB is retained in the cytoplasm by association with an inhibitor protein, I-kB. In response to a variety of stimuli, including mitogens, cytokines, and bacterial products, I-kB is phosphorylated by I-kB kinase (IKK), ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The activation of NF-kB by bacterial products such as LPS is important in the innate immune response. The activation of NF-kB by cytokines such as TNF-alpha is involved in the inflammatory response. The activation of NF-kB by bacterial products such as LPS is important in the innate immune response.

  "The actions of thyroid hormone are mediated by two receptors, TR alpha and TR beta, which bind to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. TR can repress transcription in the absence of ligand, but is activated by thyroid hormone. The unliganded TR represses transcription by recruiting corepressors, including NCoR and SMRT, to the promoter region of the target gene. Upon binding of ligand, the corepressors are released and a coactivator complex is recruited, including p160, CBP / p300, and the Swi / Snf family of chromatin remodeling factors. The coactivators in turn interact with the basal transcriptional machinery to activate transcription. The balance of corepressors and coactivators bound to TR is influenced by the presence or absence of ligand, and by the phosphorylation state of the receptor.",
  "The immune system consists of several different cell types, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells. Macrophages and lymphocytes respond to infection by secreting cytokines that alert the body and stimulate the immune system to respond more effectively. The first line of defense against infection is the innate immune system, which responds to the presence of infection without prior exposure. Macrophages and natural killer cells are part of the innate immune system and respond to infection by secreting cytokines that alert the body and stimulate the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is activated only after the initial infection has been eliminated by the innate immune system. The adaptive immune system is slower and more specific in its response to infection. T cells and B cells respond to infection by secreting specific types of cytokines that stimulate the immune system to respond more effectively. Cytokines are small proteins secreted by other cells that act in a paracrine or autocrine manner to regulate the immune response. The innate immune system responds to infection with the secretion of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, that stimulate the inflammatory response and activate macrophages and natural killer cells. B cells and T cells respond to infection with the secretion of antibodies and T cells secrete cytokines that stimulate the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The adaptive immune system is activated only after the innate immune system has been activated by infection. The adaptive immune system is slower and more specific in its response to infection. T cells and B cells respond to infection with the secretion of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and TNF, that stimulate the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells and T cells into helper T cells that stimulate the differentiation of B cells and other immune cells. The coordinated response of the innate and adaptive immune systems provides a more rapid and effective response to infection than the innate immune system alone.",
  "The Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in development and is also involved in the formation of some cancers. Secreted Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptors and activate the Wnt / frizzled pathway. Frizzled proteins are G-protein coupled receptors and activate heterotrimeric G proteins. G-protein activation leads to the activation of phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate. The increase in inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate activates calcium release from intracellular stores. Wnt also activates the small G protein Rho, which activates the kinase PKN. Wnt activation of the JNK pathway is also G-protein dependent. Wnt activation of the JNK pathway is blocked by expression of the axin tumor suppressor, which binds to the protein kinase CK1delta and GSK-3. GSK-3 is part of a multiprotein complex that phosphorylates beta-catenin, targeting it for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Activation of Wnt signaling by Wnt leads to the inhibition of GSK-3, which leads to the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus. Beta-catenin forms a complex with the transcription factors of the TCF / LEF family and activates the transcription of Wnt target genes. The transcription factor NFAT is another target of GSK-3 phosphorylation. NFAT is a transcription factor that is activated by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Wnt signaling also regulates the expression of NFAT.",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects primarily the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). SPs are extracellular deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta), a peptide derived from the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage. NFTs are intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau. The amyloid cascade hypothesis states that Abeta plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. According to this hypothesis, the Abeta-induced neurotoxicity is mediated by the formation of amyloid plaques, which leads to the accumulation of tau proteins, which in turn causes synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Recent studies have revealed that Abeta can be produced in neurons and that intraneuronal Abeta may be more toxic than extracellular Abeta. In addition, Abeta may also be involved in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",
  "Chemokine receptors are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that respond to chemotactic cytokines and are expressed on leukocytes, endothelial cells, and neurons. The ligands for these receptors are small proteins that are released by activated cells and act as chemoattractants to direct cell migration. The ligands include the chemokine Stromal Cell Derived Factor-1 (SDF-1) and the chemokine Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-3 (MIP-3). The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are used by HIV to gain entry into cells. The interaction of HIV with chemokine receptors activates signaling pathways that lead to cellular activation and possibly viral replication. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are also used by the T-tropic strains of HIV to infect cells. The interaction of HIV with chemokine receptors activates signaling pathways that lead to cellular activation and possibly viral replication.",
  "Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose residues that serves as a major source of glucose in animals. In muscle, glycogen is rapidly degraded to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose upon exercise. The glucose-1-phosphate is released into the blood and is taken up by other tissues to be converted to glucose. The breakdown of glycogen in muscle is catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase, which is activated by phosphorylation of a conserved Seryl residue. The enzyme is also allosterically activated by AMP and inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate. The breakdown of glycogen in liver is catalyzed by a different set of enzymes. In this case, the glucose residues are released as glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose by hexokinase. The glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose by phosphoglucomutase. The glucose-1-phosphate is also converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. The glucose-6-phosphate is converted to glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase. The liver enzyme for glucose-6-phosphatase is also present in kidney and intestine. The liver enzyme for glycogen phosphorylase is also present in skeletal muscle, where it catalyzes the release of glucose from glycogen. The enzyme is activated by phosphorylation of a Seryl residue, and is inhibited by glucose-1-phosphate.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of proteolytic reactions that result in the formation of a clot at the site of vascular injury. The coagulation cascade can be divided into three phases: the extrinsic activation phase, the intrinsic activation phase, and the final common pathway. The extrinsic activation phase begins with the formation of a tissue factor (TF) -factor VIIa (FVII) complex in response to vascular injury. The TF-FVIIa complex activates factor X (FX), which is in turn activated by factor Xa (FXa). The TF-FVIIa complex also activates factor V (FV). The activated factors X and V form a complex that activates prothrombin. The intrinsic activation phase is triggered by the release of the platelet membrane-associated factors. alpha-Granulins are a class of proteins that are rich in tyrosine residues. The alpha-granules of platelets contain several factors that are released during platelet activation. These factors include ADP, epinephrine, serotonin, and PDGF. The release of these factors from the alpha-granules causes the activation of the coagulation cascade. The final common pathway is initiated by the activation of the tissue factor (TF) -factor VIIa complex. The TF-VIIa complex activates factors IX and X, which form a complex that activates prothrombin.",
  "The RAS family of small GTPases are key regulators of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Activating mutations in RAS genes are found in approximately one-third of all human cancers. The RAS proteins are molecular on / off switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. In the active state, RAS interacts with a variety of downstream effectors to transmit the signal. The RAS-activated kinases RAF, PI3K, and RalGDS are involved in the mitogenic pathway, while the RAS-activated kinases RALGDS, TBK1, and RIN1 are involved in the survival pathway. The importance of RAS in cancer has led to the development of inhibitors that block the interaction of RAS with its effectors. One such inhibitor, Farnesyltransferase inhibitor R1 1 5 7 7 7, is in phase I clinical trials.",
  "The immune system is comprised of a variety of cells, each of which plays a specific role in the immune response. T cells are key players in the immune response, and are responsible for coordinating the response to foreign antigens through the recognition of specific antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells. T cells are also involved in the recognition of self antigens, and are called self-reactive T cells. T cells are classified into two types based on the antigen they recognize. Helper T cells respond to antigens presented by MHC II molecules, while cytotoxic T cells respond to antigens presented by MHC I molecules. Helper T cells produce cytokines that stimulate other cells in the immune system, while cytotoxic T cells directly kill cells that present the specific antigen. Naive T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells. The activation of helper T cells requires the interaction of the T cell receptor with antigen-MHC complex, and the interaction of costimulatory molecules on the antigen-presenting cell with T cell receptors on the T cell. Cytotoxic T cell activation also requires the interaction of the T cell receptor with antigen-MHC, but in addition requires the interaction of costimulatory molecules on the antigen-presenting cell with T cell receptors on the T cell. Cytotoxic T cell activation also requires the interaction of cytokines produced by helper T cells with the antigen-presenting cell and the T cell. Cytotoxic T cells are also involved in the direct killing of cells that present specific antigens, and are called cytotoxic T cells. The differentiation of helper T cells into memory cells requires the interaction of the T cell receptor with antigen-MHC, and the interaction of costimulatory molecules with T cell receptors on the T cell. The interaction of cytokines produced by helper T cells with antigen-presenting cells and the T cell also plays a role in the differentiation of T cells into memory cells.",
  "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA (A)) receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. The GABA (A) receptor is a member of the cys-loop family of receptors that also includes the receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, and glycine. Each subunit has a large amino-terminal extracellular domain, four transmembrane domains (M1-M4), a large second intracellular loop, a small extracellular loop, and a carboxy-terminal domain. The GABA (A) receptor is a pentamer, with five subunits surrounding a central pore. Each subunit has a unique pattern of expression in the brain and specific functional properties. The GABA (A) receptor is a major target of the general anesthetic propofol. The receptor is also the site of action of the drugs barbiturates and benzodiazepines. The genes for the subunits of the GABA (A) receptor have been identified and mapped to chromosomes 2q3 7 for the alpha subunits, 5q3 2 for the beta subunits, 2q3 2-.3 for the gamma subunits, and 4p1 5 for the delta subunit. The GABA (A) receptor is a major target of the action of the general anesthetic propofol. Mutations in the GABA (A) receptor have been identified in patients with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures.",
  "The initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is a highly conserved process that takes place once per cell cycle and is strictly regulated. The first step in the initiation of DNA replication is the formation of a pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at each replication origin. The formation of the pre-RC requires the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC), cdc6, cdt1 and the mini-chromosome maintenance complex (Mcm) to chromatin in G1 phase. The binding of the pre-RC to chromatin is prevented by the binding of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -cyclin complex to ORC, cdc6 and cdt1. At the G1 / S transition, the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) leads to the conversion of the pre-RC to a pre-initiation complex (pre-IC). The binding of the mini-chromosome maintenance complex (Mcm) to chromatin and the activation of the replication fork helicase (Cdc4 5 and the GINS complex) are the next steps in the initiation of DNA replication.",
  "Inflammation is a response to harmful stimuli, such as bacteria, viruses, and irritants, and is essential for the elimination of these agents. The inflammatory response is initiated by the activation of resident tissue macrophages and the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the site of inflammation. Macrophages are the first responders to tissue injury and infection, and are activated by cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 (IL-1), to produce inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and reactive oxygen species. Macrophages also produce IL-8, a chemokine that attracts neutrophils to the site of inflammation. Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and are activated by IL-8 and other chemokines to migrate to the site of infection. Activated macrophages and neutrophils secrete additional inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and reactive oxygen species, that amplify the inflammatory response. The inflammatory response is tightly regulated to prevent damage to normal tissues, and cytokines play a key role in this regulation. For example, IL-1 0 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the production of IL-1, TNF, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory response is also regulated by anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 induce the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which in turn inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is essential for the regulation of inflammation, and disruption of this balance can lead to disease. For example, a disruption of the IL-10 / IL-1 0 balance can lead to autoimmune disease, and a disruption of the IL-4 / IL-1 3 balance can lead to asthma.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved signaling module that is used by various extracellular stimuli to regulate a variety of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. The core module consists of a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), an MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPK. The MAPKKKs include Raf, MEKK, and mixed lineage kinase (MLK) families. The MAPKKs include p38 kinase (p44 and p38) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) kinase (p46 and p36) families. The MAPKs include extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 kinase (p38), and JNK. Growth factors and cytokines activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or cytokine receptors, which recruit and activate the small G proteins RAS and RAC. These small G proteins activate several downstream effectors, including the p21RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK kinase cascade and the p13RAS-RAC-MEKK1-p38 kinase cascade. The activation of these kinases ultimately leads to the phosphorylation and activation of various transcription factors, including ELK, ATF2, SRF, and STATs.",
  "The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGF receptor is activated by binding of its ligand, EGF.

  "The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is a key regulator of actin cytoskeletal structure and dynamics. WASP is a member of the WASP family of proteins, which also includes N-WASP, WAVE1, WAVE2 and WAVE3. The WASP family members are characterized by the presence of a C-terminal verprolin-homology, central acidic (VCA) region that binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin monomers, and a N-terminal verprolin-homology domain (V) and a WASP-homology (WH1) domain that binds to other proteins. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a seven protein complex that nucleates actin polymerization and is involved in the formation of branched actin networks. The WASP family proteins are regulated by a variety of factors, including the Rho family of small GTPases, phosphoinositides, and phosphorylation. The activity of WASP is stimulated by binding of Cdc4 2-GTP to the GBD, which relieves an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction between the N-terminal WH1 domain and the VCA region.

  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that signals through a receptor complex that includes the ligand-binding subunit (gp8 0) and the signal transducing subunit (gp1 3 0). The IL-6 receptor is widely expressed on cells of the hematopoietic system, hepatocytes, neurons, and other cell types. The IL-6 receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor family, which includes the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF. The IL-6 receptor is a heterodimer, with gp1 3 0 being the signal transducing subunit. The IL-6 receptor does not have intrinsic kinase activity, but associates with JAK kinases that are activated by the receptor upon ligand binding. The JAKs phosphorylate the receptor and the associated gp1 3 0, creating binding sites for signaling molecules like STAT3. STAT3 is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine and is then able to dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription.

Binding of PDGF to its receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity. The activated receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates a number of cellular proteins including the PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta themselves. The phosphorylated receptor and other substrates bind to SH2 containing signaling proteins, such as GRB2 and the 8 5kDa subunit of PI3 kinase. Other signaling proteins include the Shc proteins, which bind to the activated PDGFR-beta and activate the RAS / MAP kinase pathway. STAT-5 is also activated by the PDGFR-beta receptor and may contribute to the mitogenic response. Other signaling pathways activated by PDGFR-beta include the PI3 kinase pathway and the PLCgamma pathway. PDGFR-alpha is not activated by the PDGFR-beta dimer, but can form active signaling complexes with PDGFR-beta. The PDGFR-alpha / PDGFR-beta receptor complexes may play a role in the development of certain cell types.",
  "The interaction of integrins with the extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical for the regulation of cell adhesion, spreading, migration and proliferation. Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-ECM interactions. The interaction of integrins with the extracellular matrix is required for cell adhesion and is involved in the regulation of cell shape, migration, proliferation and differentiation.

  "The immune system is a complex network of cells and soluble factors that protect against invading pathogens and that also plays a role in the recognition and elimination of malignant cells. T cells are a key component of the adaptive immune system and are required for the immune response to foreign antigens. T cells are classified into two major groups, T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells, based on their function. T helper cells are required for the immune response to extracellular pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, and produce the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1 0 and IL-1 2. Cytotoxic T cells are required for the immune response to intracellular pathogens, such as parasites and viruses, and produce the cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Cytotoxic T cells are also involved in the recognition and elimination of malignant cells. T cell activation requires two signals. The first signal is provided by the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to antigen presented by MHC-I on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. The second signal is provided by costimulatory molecules that bind to counter receptors on the T cell and activate the T cell. Cytotoxic T cell activation requires the interaction of CD2 8 with B7. 1 (CD8 0) and B7. 2 (CD8 6) on the antigen-presenting cell with the T cell receptor associated protein kinase, CD28-associated kinase. Cytotoxic T cell activation also requires the interaction of the T cell receptor with the costimulatory molecule ICOS with its ligand B7h.

  "Neuropeptide signaling is a major mechanism of intercellular communication in the brain. Neuropeptides are a diverse class of signaling molecules, including neuropeptides (e.g., enkephalins, substance P, and bradykinin) and neuropeptides (e.g., oxytocin, vasopressin, and acetylcholine). Neuropeptides are widely expressed in the nervous system and act as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neurohormones. Neuropeptides are released from nerve terminals and act on receptors on the same or neighboring cells. Neuropeptide receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are found on both neurons and glial cells. Neuropeptide receptors are classified into four groups based on their coupling to G proteins. GPCRs coupled to Gs stimulate adenylyl cyclase and increase intracellular cAMP levels. GPCRs coupled to Gi and Go inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease cAMP levels. GPCRs coupled to Gq stimulate phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol.

The CD24 subunit is also required for efficient expression of the TCR complex. The CD24 subunit is also required for efficient signaling by the TCR complex.",
  "The CD79 gene encodes a protein with three immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The CD79 protein is expressed in a limited set of cells including B cells, T cells, and NK cells. The CD79 protein is associated with the BCR in B cells and the TCR in T cells. The CD79 protein is tyrosine phosphorylated upon BCR ligation and TCR ligation. The CD79 protein is required for normal T cell development and B cell development. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD79 protein is mediated by the Src family kinase Lck and the Syk family kinase Zap-7 0. The CD79 protein is required for the activation of the MAP kinase pathway by the BCR and TCR. The CD79 protein also associates with the Vav protein and may activate the Vav protein by recruiting a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The CD79 protein is required for normal T cell development and B cell development.",
  "The ATM gene is mutated in the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). AT patients are sensitive to ionizing radiation and are at increased risk for the development of cancer. The ATM protein is a protein kinase that phosphorylates itself and other proteins in response to DNA damage. ATM phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein p60 RB, and the checkpoint kinase chk1 in response to DNA damage. ATM also phosphorylates the breast cancer susceptibility gene product, BRCA1, in response to DNA damage. The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. The role of ATM in cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair may be responsible for the increased cancer risk observed in AT patients.",
  "Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that results from the destruction of the thyroid gland by self-reactive T cells. The disease is characterized by the presence of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyroid autoantibodies, and lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid. The etiology of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not known, but it is believed that genetic factors and environmental factors, such as dietary iodine, may play a role. Environmental factors may trigger autoimmune responses by inducing the expression of self-antigens on the surface of thyrocytes. The expression of self-antigens may be induced by interferon-gamma, a cytokine secreted by Th1 cells. The presence of self-reactive T cells in the thyroid may be due to defects in the mechanisms that normally prevent the activation of self-reactive T cells. Self-reactive T cells may be activated by self-antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells in the absence of regulatory signals provided by regulatory T cells.",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication. MMR also plays an important role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing mutations from being passed on to the next generation. Defects in MMR genes are associated with genome-wide instability and predisposition to certain types of cancer. The Escherichia coli MMR system is well characterized and consists of five proteins that are required for MMR. MutS recognizes the mismatch and then interacts with MutL to form a MutS-MutL-mismatch ternary complex. The MutH endonuclease is activated in the ternary complex and incises the unmethylated daughter strand on the nearest side to the mismatch. UvrD helicase and exonuclease I (ExoI) are recruited to the mismatch-containing region and remove the error-containing strand. DNA polymerase III and DNA ligase complete the repair. In contrast to E. coli MMR, eukaryotic MMR requires additional factors to carry out the repair. Human MMR is a more complex system involving at least seven different proteins. The human MutS homologs MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3 are the central components of the MMR machinery. Human MutL homologs include MLH1-PMS2, MLH1-PMS1, and MLH3-PMS1. The exonuclease 1 (EXO1) is also involved in eukaryotic MMR. RPA and RFC are required for the assembly of the human MMR system.",
  "Cell-cell adhesion is fundamental to the function of all cells in the body. Cell-cell adhesion is mediated by a variety of adhesive molecules that are classified into two major groups: the immunoglobulin superfamily and the integrin superfamily. The immunoglobulin superfamily includes classical cadherins, nectins, protocadherins, and pentraxins. Integrins consist of noncovalently associated alpha and beta subunits. Cell-cell adhesion is essential for the maintenance of tissue architecture and is involved in a wide variety of biological processes, including cell migration, differentiation, and activation.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity. It is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The EGFR is over-expressed in many types of cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. The EGFR is activated by binding of its natural ligand, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). Binding of EGF or TGF-alpha to the receptor induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. These phosphotyrosine residues serve as binding sites for cytoplasmic signaling proteins containing src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The adaptor protein GRB2 binds to the receptor via an interaction between GRB2 and the adaptor protein SHC. GRB2 in turn interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1, activating the ras / MAPK pathway. The ras / MAPK pathway leads to activation of transcription factors such as c-Myc and ELK-1. Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) also plays a role in the EGFR signaling pathway. PLC-gamma catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce the second messengers IP3 and DAG. IP3 binds to its receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing calcium ions into the cytoplasm. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), which can also activate the ras / MAPK pathway. JAK / STAT signaling also appears to play a role in EGFR signaling.",
  "The CD40 receptor is a member of the TNF receptor gene family and is expressed on the surface of B cells and activated T cells. The ligand for CD40 is CD154, also known as CD15 0. The interaction of CD40 and CD154 is involved in a variety of immune responses, including B cell activation, T cell activation, and Ig class switching. The interaction of CD40 and CD154 also plays a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as lupus. The cytoplasmic domain of CD40 does not have intrinsic kinase activity but associates with TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs). The TRAF proteins are a family of adaptor proteins that mediate signaling by members of the TNF receptor gene family. The TRAF proteins bind to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain through a conserved TRAF binding motif. The TRAF proteins also interact with other signaling molecules, including members of the TGF-beta receptor family, suggesting that the TRAF proteins may be involved in the signaling of multiple receptors. The TRAF proteins are involved in signaling by CD40 and other TNF receptor family members through several different pathways. The TRAF proteins are involved in the activation of NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways by CD40 and other TNF receptor family members. The TRAF proteins also interact with members of the I-TRAF family of proteins that inhibit TRAF-mediated signaling. The I-TRAF proteins may play a role in the regulation of immune responses.",
  "Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that causes severe diarrheal disease in humans and other animals. The life cycle of C. parvum is complex and includes two stages, the extracellular oocyst and the intracellular trophozoite. The oocyst is resistant to environmental extremes and can survive for years in the environment. The infection of C. parvum begins with the ingestion of contaminated food or water by a susceptible host. The oocyst is passed through the stomach to the small intestine, where it is sporulated and released as infectious sporozoites. The sporozoites are actively invasive and invade the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Intracellular development of C. parvum takes approximately 2 4 h. The invaded IECs form a parasitophorous vacuole (PV), which is derived from the host cell membrane and contains the parasite's membranous organelles. The PV membrane is disrupted, and the parasite replicates within a membranous structure derived from the host cell membrane, the vacuole. The parasite then exits the PV and multiples by endodyogeny, forming thousands of merozoites that are released into the intestinal lumen. The excreted-secreted antigens (ESA) of C. parvum are important for the interaction of the parasite with the host cell. The ESA are released from the parasite and are present in the intestinal lumen. The ESA are involved in the modification of the intestinal environment and the immune response.",
  "Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart disease that can result from a variety of etiologies, including viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and toxic drug reactions. Viral myocarditis is caused by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a single-stranded RNA virus, which can infect both cardiac myocytes and immune cells. CVB3 infection can lead to viral replication in myocytes, resulting in viral myocarditis. CVB3 can also infect macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs can directly kill virus-infected myocytes, but may also cause damage to uninfected myocytes through the release of perforin and granzyme. Viral infection can also trigger the production of interferons (IFNs), which can induce apoptosis in both virus-infected and uninfected cells. Viral myocarditis can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by ventricular dilatation and impaired contractile function, in some patients. Viral myocarditis may be a key factor in the development of DCM.",
  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1, and parkin are associated with early-onset PD. Mutations in PINK1, DJ1, and LRRK2 are associated with autosomal-dominant PD. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1, and parkin are associated with autosomal-recessive PD. Mutations in parkin, PINK1, and DJ1 are associated with autosomal-recessive PD. These proteins may be involved in different pathways to cause PD. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that may be involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Mutations in parkin may lead to a decrease in UPS function, which may result in the accumulation of toxic proteins and neuronal cell death. Pink1 is a mitochondrial kinase that may be involved in mitochondrial function and turnover. DJ1 is an oxidative stress response protein that may be involved in mitochondrial function. Mutations in these proteins may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which may cause dopaminergic neuronal death.",
  "The cardiac isoform of the sarcoplasmic / endoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA2a) is essential for cardiac muscle relaxation. SERCA2a transports Ca2 + from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), an intracellular Ca2 + store, and is regulated by Ca2 + -calmodulin (CaM) and phospholamban (PLN). Ca2 + -CaM activates SERCA2a by inducing a conformational change in SERCA2a, which exposes its active site for Ca2 +. The inhibition of SERCA2a by PLN is relieved when Ca2 + dissociates from CaM.",
  "The m2 muscarinic receptor (m2AChR) is a GPCR that is coupled to Gi / o-proteins and is involved in the inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters. The m2AChR is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. The mitogenic effect of the m2AChR is mediated by the \u03b2\u03b3 subunits of Gi / o-proteins and the subsequent activation of the ras / MAP kinase pathway. The release of arachidonic acid by phospholipase C is also involved in the mitogenic effect of the m2AChR. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway by the m2AChR is mediated by the small G-protein ras and the raf-1 kinase. The activation of the ras / MAP kinase pathway by the m2AChR is also mediated by the tyrosine kinase src. The activation of the ras / MAP kinase pathway by the m2AChR is inhibited by the binding of arrestins to the activated receptor. The binding of arrestins to the activated receptor also leads to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway by a mechanism that does not involve arrestins.",
  "The production of prostaglandins by the inducible enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key component of the inflammatory response. The production of prostaglandins is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which catalyses the release of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids. The release of arachidonic acid is stimulated by a variety of inflammatory mediators, including the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin, the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Beta (IL-1Beta). The activation of PLA2 is regulated by the convergence of several signalling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, the Ca2 + signalling pathway and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. The activation of PLA2 by IL-1Beta and LPS is mediated by the MAPK pathway, whereas the activation of PLA2 by bradykinin is mediated by the Ca2 + signalling pathway. The activation of PLA2 by IL-1Beta and LPS is mediated by the small G-protein Ras, which activates phospholipase C (PLC), resulting in the production of IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 causes the release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores, whereas DAG activates PKC. The activation of PLA2 by bradykinin is mediated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2. The activation of cPLA2 by Pyk2 is independent of PKC and Ras. The activation of Pyk2 by IL-1Beta and LPS is mediated by the adaptor protein Shc, which binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-1Beta receptor. The activation of Pyk2 by bradykinin is mediated by the small G-protein Rac1, which activates the tyrosine kinase Src. The activation of cPLA2 by IL-1Beta and LPS is also mediated by the serine / threonine kinase map kinase. The activation of cPLA2 by IL-1Beta and LPS is also mediated by the transcription factor NF-kB. The activation of cPLA2 by bradykinin is independent of the MAPK cascade and PKC. The activation of cPLA2 by bradykinin is mediated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of cPLA2 by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn. The activation of cPLA2 by IL-1Beta and LPS is also independent of the transcription factor NF-kB. The activation of cPLA2 by bradykinin is also independent of the transcription factor AP-1.",
  "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel that also functions as a regulator of other ion channels. The most common mutation in CF is a deletion of three nucleotides that results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 5 0 8 (F5 0 8del). CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene family and functions as a chloride channel and also as a regulator of other ion channels. The absence of functional CFTR leads to abnormalities in the regulation of other ion channels, including the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC). The absence of CFTR also affects the mucus layer in the lungs, which becomes thick and sticky, increasing the susceptibility of individuals with CF to bacterial infection.",
  "Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common autoimmune thyroid disease, with a prevalence of about 2% in the general population. HT is characterized by the presence of circulating thyroid autoantibodies (TAbs) directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (Tg) and / or the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). The presence of TAbs is a marker of autoimmune thyroid disease and is found in about 1 0% of women and 3% of men. HT is usually preceded by autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), which is a chronic autoimmune disease with a fluctuating course. AIT is characterized by the presence of thyroid autoantibodies and / or thyroid dysfunction. AIT can be classified into two groups: AIT with thyroid-specific autoantibodies (TPO, Tg, TSHR) and AIT without thyroid-specific autoantibodies. AIT with thyroid-specific autoantibodies can be further subdivided into AIT with thyroid-specific autoantibodies and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies (AITD-IgG) and AIT with thyroid-specific autoantibodies and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR). AIT without thyroid-specific autoantibodies can be further subdivided into AITD-IgG-positive and AITD-IgG-negative AIT. AIT-IgG-positive AIT is characterized by the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR) and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. AIT-IgG-negative AIT is characterized by the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR) and normal TSH levels. AIT-IgG-positive AIT is associated with the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR) and thyroid dysfunction. AIT-IgG-negative AIT is associated with the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR) and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. AIT-IgG-positive AIT is associated with the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR) and thyroid dysfunction. AIT-TSHR-positive AIT is associated with the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR) and thyroid dysfunction. AIT-TSHR-negative AIT is associated with the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (AITD-TSHR) and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.",
  "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are the major cellular effectors of immune responses. CTLs and NK cells are activated by recognition of specific antigens on target cells, such as virus-infected cells, and secrete perforin and granzyme proteins to induce apoptosis in the target cells. Perforin is a protein that is secreted by CTLs and NK cells to form pores in the membranes of the target cells. The perforin pores allow the entry of granzyme proteins into the target cells, which are normally localized in the cytoplasm. Granzyme proteins enter the target cell and are then released into the cytoplasm to activate caspases and induce apoptosis. Perforin and granzyme proteins also induce apoptosis by a caspase-independent mechanism that involves the translocation of the acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP3 2) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the subsequent degradation of nuclear DNA. The translocation of ANP3 2 is induced by granzyme B, which cleaves ANP3 2 at aspartic acid residues. The caspase-independent apoptosis induced by perforin and granzyme proteins is important for the elimination of virus-infected cells by CTLs and NK cells.",
  "TNF is a potent inflammatory cytokine that induces a variety of cellular responses including apoptosis, inflammation, and the activation of T cells. The TNF receptor superfamily contains 2 0 members, many of which are activated by TNF. The receptors for TNF are characterized by an intracellular domain called the TRAF domain. Binding of TNF to its receptor recruits the TRAF domain to the receptor complex, activating downstream signaling pathways. The TRAF domain is a protein-protein interaction domain that interacts with other signaling proteins, including members of the MAP kinase family. The TRAF-interacting protein NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase) is a MAP kinase kinase kinase that activates the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, a member of the MAP kinase family. The TRAF-interacting protein TANK (I-TRAF) binds to the TRAF domain of TRAF proteins, blocking the interaction of NIK with the TRAF domain and inhibiting the activation of the JNK pathway. The activation of the NF-kappaB pathway by TNF does not appear to involve NIK or the MAP kinase kinases, but may involve the RIP kinase. The activation of NF-kappaB by TNF also does not appear to involve the TRAF proteins, but does involve TRAF2. TRAF2 is a protein-protein interaction domain that interacts with several different proteins, including RIP, NIK, and TANK. TRAF2 also acts as a ubiquitin ligase, adding K6 3-linked ubiquitin chains to itself and to other proteins. The ubiquitination of proteins by the TRAF proteins may play a role in their signaling function.",
  "The development of B cells and T cells is regulated by a complex interplay of positive and negative signals provided by the antigen receptor and other costimulatory molecules.

  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a cell surface protein complex that is expressed on all T cells and that is composed of alpha and beta subunits noncovalently associated with the invariant CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chains. The TCR recognizes specific peptide antigens bound to MHC molecules on the surface of other cells. The interaction of the TCR with peptide-MHC on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell stimulates T cell activation. The CD3 complex is required for T cell activation and is associated with the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the TCR-associated protein tyrosine kinase, Lck. The interaction of the TCR with peptide-MHC stimulates the phosphorylation of the CD3 complex and other proteins by Lck.

  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilatation and impaired function of the left or both ventricles. The disease is characterised by progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Familial DCM is caused by mutations in genes encoding for structural and functional proteins of the cardiomyocyte. The most common cause of familial DCM is mutations in the gene encoding for the cardiac isoform of beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC). In mice, a point mutation in beta-MHC (Arg4 0 3Gln) has been shown to cause a phenotype similar to human DCM. In the heart of mice carrying the Arg4 0 3Gln mutation, the left ventricular (LV) wall is thin and the LV chamber is dilated. The mutation leads to a reduction in the ATPase activity of myosin and a decrease in the velocity of actin filament sliding. The decrease in the velocity of actin filament sliding is accompanied by a shift in the position of the thin-filament-regulatory-troponin complex. This shift is caused by a reduction in the Ca2 + sensitivity of the thin-filament-regulatory-troponin complex. The shift in the position of the thin-filament-regulatory-troponin complex is also caused by a reduction in the Ca2 + affinity of the regulatory troponin complex. The shift in the position of the thin-filament-regulatory-troponin complex is accompanied by a reduction in the Ca2 + sensitivity of the force development. The reduction in the Ca2 + sensitivity of the force development is also observed in human heart failure. The reduction in the Ca2 + sensitivity of the force development is expected to depress the response of the heart to increases in intracellular Ca2 + concentration. This may lead to a reduced force development and a reduced response of the heart to increases in intracellular Ca2 + concentration.",
  "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are selectively destroyed by the immune system. Environmental factors, such as viral infections, may trigger the autoimmune response, but genetic factors are also important. The first genetic evidence for the importance of genetic factors in type I diabetes was the discovery that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p2 1 is associated with type I diabetes. The HLA-DQ and HLA-DR genes are involved in the presentation of self-antigens to the immune system. The presence of certain HLA-DQ and HLA-DR alleles increases the risk of developing type I diabetes, while the absence of these alleles protects against the disease. Environmental factors, such as viral infections, may trigger the autoimmune response, but genetic factors are also important. The identification of the genes involved in type I diabetes will help to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and may lead to the development of new therapies.",
  "The intestinal epithelium is a complex tissue that serves to form a selective barrier between the organism and the environment. The intestinal epithelium is a rapidly renewing tissue and its maintenance is dependent upon the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells. The intestinal epithelium is organized into two distinct cell types, the absorptive villus cells and the secretory crypt cells. The villus cells are responsible for the absorption of nutrients and water, while the crypt cells are involved in the secretion of water and electrolytes. The differentiation of epithelial cells is accompanied by changes in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins. In undifferentiated cells, actin filaments are abundant and form a cortical structure beneath the plasma membrane. As cells differentiate, they lose their actin cytoskeleton and become more specialized. In the villus cells, actin filaments are replaced by intermediate filaments, which are composed of keratins. In addition to the cytoskeletal proteins, intestinal epithelial cells express a variety of cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, integrins, and occludins. The expression of these molecules is also regulated during cell differentiation.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly regulated process that ensures the accurate duplication and segregation of genetic material. The cell cycle is divided into four phases: G1, S, G2 and M, with the intervening gaps designated as gaps 1 and 2 (G1 and G2). The G1 phase is the gap between the duplication of DNA and the initiation of DNA replication. The S phase is the period of DNA replication and the G2 phase is the gap between the S phase and the initiation of mitosis. The cell cycle is regulated by a variety of factors, including the presence of growth factors and the availability of nutrients. The presence of growth factors activates signaling pathways that stimulate cell cycle progression. The presence of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids is required for cell cycle progression. The presence of growth factors and nutrients stimulate the production of ATP, which is required for cell growth. The production of ATP also stimulates the production of GTP, which is required for the activation of Ras and Rho. Ras and Rho activate the Raf / MEK / Erk and PI3K / Akt pathways, respectively, which stimulate cell cycle progression. The presence of growth factors and nutrients also stimulates the uptake of amino acids, which are used to produce new proteins. The completion of cell cycle progression is required for the production of a daughter cell with a complete set of chromosomes. The presence of DNA damage or the absence of nutrients activates checkpoints that prevent cell cycle progression. The DNA damage checkpoint is activated by the presence of DNA damage and halts the cell cycle to allow time for DNA repair. The absence of nutrients activates the metabolic checkpoint, which halts the cell cycle to prevent the production of cells with damaged DNA. The metabolic checkpoint is activated by the absence of glucose and other nutrients. The metabolic checkpoint is activated by the absence of glucose and other nutrients and halts the cell cycle to prevent the production of cells with damaged DNA.",
  "The selectin family of adhesion molecules includes E-selectin (also known as ELAM-1, CD6 2E, sELAM-1, and LECAM-1), P-selectin (also known as CD6 2P, GMP-1 4 0, and PADGEM), and L-selectin (also known as LAM-1 and LECAM-2). These molecules are involved in the initial steps of the inflammatory response, including leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and migration. Selectins are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with an extracellular domain that contains an amino terminal lectin domain, a fibronectin type II domain, and a complement-like domain. The lectin domain binds to carbohydrate ligands on the surface of other cells. P-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated platelets and endothelial cells. It is involved in the initial stages of inflammation and thrombosis. L-selectin is expressed on the surface of leukocytes and binds to ligands on the surface of activated endothelial cells. E-selectin is expressed on the surface of inflamed endothelial cells and leukocytes and is involved in the later stages of inflammation. The selectin family members are similar in structure and function, but have distinct expression patterns and different ligands.",
  "Cell motility is a fundamental feature of many biological processes, including embryonic development, immune responses, and wound healing. Cell motility is also involved in the spread of cancer cells and in the spread of bacteria and parasites. Cell motility is driven by the formation of actin-based structures, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, which are formed by the polymerization of actin filaments. The formation of actin-based structures is regulated by the Rho family of small GTPases, including Rac, Rho, and Cdc42. Rac and Cdc42 induce the formation of lamellipodia, while Rho induces the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Cdc42 is activated by the Dbl family of oncogenes, which includes Dbl, Vav, and Vav-2. Cdc42 activates Cdc42 by causing Cdc42 to release GDP, allowing it to reassociate with GTP. Cdc42 activates Cdc42 by causing Cdc42 to release its bound GDP. Cdc42 activates the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family of proteins, including N-WASP and WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE). Cdc42 activates N-WASP by causing N-WASP to change its conformation, exposing a binding site for the Arp2 / 3 complex. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a seven-protein complex that nucleates the formation of actin filaments and that is involved in the formation of actin-based structures. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a heterodimer of Arp2 and Arp3. Arp2 and Arp3 form a Y-shaped structure with a central region and three verprolin-like repeats at each end. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a constitutive dimer in solution, but upon binding to N-WASP or WAVE, Arp2 / 3 is activated and it binds to the side of an actin filament. The formation of an actin network by the Arp2 / 3 complex creates a branched actin filament network that pushes out the membrane of a cell and creates lamellipodia. Cdc42 and the WASP family of proteins are involved in other actin-based structures, such as filopodia. The formation of filopodia is induced by the formation of bundles of actin filaments by Cdc42 and the formation of filopodia is dependent on the formation of actin bundles by Cdc42.",
  "Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a cytokine that stimulates the growth and differentiation of cells of the myeloid lineage. The IL-3 receptor is a heterodimer, consisting of an alpha subunit (IL-3Ra) and a beta subunit (IL-3Rb). The beta subunit is shared with IL-5 and GM-CSF. Binding of IL-3 to its receptor causes receptor dimerization, activation of JAK kinases, and phosphorylation of the beta subunit. The phosphorylated beta subunit recruits and activates the tyrosine kinase src. The activated src phosphorylates Shc, which in turn activates the ras-MAP kinase pathway. The ras-MAP kinase pathway leads to activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and Egr-1. The JAK-STAT pathway leads to activation of other transcription factors such as STAT5. The ras-MAP kinase pathway and STAT pathways appear to be independent of one another.",
  "p53 is a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. The p53 gene is mutated in a variety of human tumors, suggesting that p53 plays a role in tumor suppression. The p53 protein is stabilized and activated in response to DNA damage by the ATM kinase. Activated p53 induces transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, including the CDK inhibitor p2 1CIP1, the DNA repair enzyme DNA-PK, and the proapoptotic protein Bax. In addition, p53 induces transcription of the gene encoding the p53 inducible protein (PIG), a protein with a putative oxidoreductase activity. PIG interacts with the tumor suppressor ARF, and induces p53-dependent apoptosis in the absence of DNA damage.",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 2 0-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are required for the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the cholera toxin A subunit and the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the Bordetella pertussis toxin. ARFs are also involved in intracellular vesicle transport. There are at least three different forms of ARF in mammalian cells, ARFA, B and C, which are encoded by separate genes. The three forms share about 9 0% amino acid sequence identity, but differ in their amino-terminal sequences. The amino-terminal 2 1aa of ARFA is replaced by a different sequence in the other two forms. The activation of ARFs by GTP is an essential step in the action of these proteins. The activation of ARFs by GTP is followed by their inactivation through the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. ARF1GAP is an ARF GTPase-activating protein that catalyzes the very rapid and specific hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. The activity of ARF1GAP is stimulated by the Golgi-associated coatomer protein complex I (COPI). The coatomer is a protein complex that is involved in vesicle formation at the Golgi complex. The stimulation of ARF1GAP by COPI suggests that the GAP activity of ARF1GAP is involved in the disassembly of COPI.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and eicosanoids. There are three subtypes of PPAR, PPAR alpha, PPAR beta, and PPAR gamma. PPAR alpha is expressed in tissues with high-energy demand such as liver, skeletal muscle, and heart. PPAR beta / delta is ubiquitously expressed, while PPAR gamma is expressed in adipose tissue. PPAR gamma is also expressed in macrophages and is involved in adipocyte differentiation. PPAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter region of target genes. The activity of PPAR is regulated by various factors including phosphorylation, ligand binding, and interaction with other proteins. The activity of PPAR is also regulated by the cellular concentration of its ligand, which is regulated by the activity of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride synthesis pathways. The activity of PPAR is also regulated by the cellular concentration of its binding protein, the PPAR-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1). PGC-1 is a coactivator for many transcription factors involved in energy metabolism. The activity of PGC-1 is also regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation. The activity of PGC-1 is also regulated by the cellular concentration of its own ligand, which is regulated by the activity of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride synthesis pathways. The activity of PGC-1 is also regulated by the cellular concentration of its own ligand.

  "The complement system is an important part of the innate immune system that provides a rapid response to invading pathogens. The complement system is comprised of more than thirty proteins that are activated in a cascade-like fashion to induce a response against foreign cells and pathogens. The first three components of the complement system, C3, C4, and C2, are activated by the classical pathway, an antibody-dependent response, while the lectin pathway is activated by the presence of carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens. The complement system is activated by three different pathways, each of which leads to the formation of a C3 convertase that cleaves the C3 complement protein. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3 molecules to form the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 to form the anaphylatoxin C5a and the membrane attack complex (MAC). The anaphylatoxin C5a is a potent inflammatory agent that recruits immune cells to the site of infection and stimulates the respiratory burst in neutrophils. The MAC causes lysis of foreign cells and the release of inflammatory cytokines. The complement system is activated by three different pathways. The classical pathway is activated by the binding of antibodies to foreign cells or antigens. The lectin pathway is activated by the presence of carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens. The alternative pathway is initiated by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3. The three pathways converge at the step that cleaves the C3 convertase. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3 molecules to form the C5 convertase. The C5 convertase cleaves C5 to form the anaphylatoxin C5a and the MAC. The formation of the MAC on the surface of pathogens causes lysis of the cell and release of inflammatory cytokines. The formation of the MAC also lyses red blood cells causing a condition called hemolytic anemia. The complement system is activated by three different pathways each of which leads to the formation of a C3 convertase. The three pathways converge at the step that cleaves the C3 convertase. The classical pathway is activated by the binding of antibodies to foreign cells or antigens. The lectin pathway is activated by the presence of carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens.

  "The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections. The gene defective in WAS encodes a 5 0kD protein (WASP) that is expressed in hematopoietic cells. WASP is a member of a family of proteins that includes the gene product of the gene defective in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like disorder, X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT). WASP is a member of a growing family of proteins that are involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton. WASP interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex, a complex of proteins that induces actin polymerization. The interaction of WASP with the Arp2 / 3 complex is regulated by the Rho family of GTPases. The interaction of WASP with the Arp2 / 3 complex induces actin polymerization and the formation of filopodia and lamellopodia. The interaction of WASP with the Rho family of GTPases is also involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The interaction of WASP with the Arp2 / 3 complex is regulated by the binding of the GTPase CDC4 2 to the CRIB domain of WASP. The interaction of CDC4 2Hs with WASP induces actin polymerization and the formation of filopodia. The interaction of WASP with CDC4 2Hs and the Arp2 / 3 complex induces the formation of lamellipodia. The interaction of WASP with Rac-1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex induces the formation of filopodia. The interaction of WASP with the Rho GTPases and the Arp2 / 3 complex regulates the formation of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of filopodia and lamellopodia.",
  "Cytokines are small secreted proteins that are produced by many different cell types and that are involved in the regulation of the immune response, inflammation, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and other processes. They are produced by many different cell types and act in a paracrine or autocrine manner. They are also involved in intercellular communication and can act on cells that are not themselves a source of the cytokine. Cytokines are classified according to their receptor structure and the class of signaling molecules they activate. The four main groups are the IL-1R family, the IL-10 family, the TNF family, and the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family. The IL-10 family cytokines include IL-10, IL-19, and IL-22. The IL-10 family cytokines act through a receptor complex that includes the IL-10RA chain. The IL-10 and IL-19 receptors also include the IL-10RB chain. The IL-10 receptor complex is distinct from the other cytokine receptor complexes in that it does not bind IL-10 itself but requires the IL-111RA chain. The IL-10 receptor complex is also distinct from the IL-1RA / IL-10RB complex in that it does not recruit JAK kinases. The IL-10 receptor complex is also distinct from the IL-1RA / IL-10RB complex in that it does not recruit the STAT proteins. The IL-10 receptor complex is also distinct from the IL-1RA / IL-10RA complex in that it does not recruit PI3 kinase. The TNF family includes TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and lymphotoxin (LT) alpha and beta. The TNF family cytokines act through a receptor complex that includes the TNF-R1, TNF-R2, or the LT-betaR. The hematopoietic cytokine receptor family includes erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), IL-3, IL-5, IL-12, IL-4, and IL-15. The EPO receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor family and is a homodimer. The TPO receptor is also a member of this family and forms a heterodimer with the TPO receptor.

  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). It is caused by the reaction of donor T cells against recipient tissues. The clinical manifestations of GVHD include skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of GVHD is complex and involves multiple factors. The initial step is recognition of host MHC molecules by donor T cells. The interaction of the T cell receptor with the MHC / peptide complex leads to T cell activation and proliferation. Activated donor T cells produce a variety of cytokines, including IL-2, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and IL-10. These cytokines can induce apoptosis in host cells, including epithelial cells, and damage the intestinal mucosa. In addition, the Fas / FasL interaction may play a role in the apoptosis of host cells. The Fas / FasL interaction may also lead to the activation-induced cell death of donor T cells. The activation of cytotoxic T cells may be induced by the interaction of donor T cells with host MHC molecules and the subsequent release of perforin and granzyme B. The cytotoxic T cells may also induce apoptosis in target cells through the Fas / FasL interaction.",
  "The calcium-dependent protease calpain is involved in the degradation of many proteins in the cell. Calpain is activated by calcium and is inhibited by calpastatin. Calpain cleaves proteins at a specific site, usually a few amino acids from a region of a protein that is rich in basic residues. Calpain is involved in a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis, cell migration, cell differentiation, and cell cycle progression. Calpain is activated by the calcium ion signal that is released during excitation of muscle cells. Calpain is also activated by oxidative stress and by the release of calcium from the mitochondria during apoptosis. Calpain activation is involved in the degradation of the dystrophin protein in muscle cells, causing the muscle cells to lose their ability to contract. The activation of calpain by oxidative stress may be involved in the aging process in many tissues. Calpain is involved in the degradation of the tau protein in Alzheimer's disease. Calpain is also involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein to produce amyloid beta-peptide, which is involved in the formation of plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Calpain is involved in the cleavage of the huntingtin protein in Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that affects the brain and causes the patients to become mentally ill. Calpain inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of these and other diseases involving the degradation of proteins.",
  "The ATM gene is mutated in the cancer prone syndrome ataxia telangiectasia. The ATM protein is a member of a family of kinases that are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. The ATM protein is activated by ionizing radiation and phosphorylates several proteins involved in cell cycle control and DNA repair. The ATM protein phosphorylates the tumor suppressor gene product p53, and the chk1 and chk2 protein kinases. The chk1 and chk2 kinases phosphorylate the p27 protein, which in turn phosphorylates the CDC2 protein phosphatase, causing the cell to arrest in G2. The phosphorylation of p53, chk1 and chk2 by ATM also activates the intra-S phase checkpoint. The ATM protein also phosphorylates the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene product, which also plays a role in the cellular response to DNA damage. The ATM protein also phosphorylates the NFkB inhibitor, IkB, activating NFkB and increasing the expression of genes involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. The ATM protein also phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, activating it and increasing the cellular response to DNA damage.",
  "The complement system is a major part of the humoral defense against infection. It consists of more than 3 0 proteins, including the opsonins C3b and C3b. the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the membrane attack complex (MAC), and several regulatory proteins. The complement system is activated by three different pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by antibodies. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrate structures on bacteria by mannan-binding lectin (MBL) or by the recognition of carbohydrate structures on viruses by the pentraxins C-reactive protein (CRP) and pentraxin 1q (pentraxin-1). The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 to C3 (H2O). C3 (H2O) binds to factor B, which is subsequently activated by factor D, resulting in the formation of the C3 convertase C3bBb. The amplification of the C3 convertase occurs through the cleavage of factor B by the convertases C3bBb and C3bBbt. The cleavage of C3 by the convertases leads to the formation of the C5 convertases C3bBbC3 and C3bBbC3bBbt. The formation of the MAC by C5b leads to the formation of a pore in the cell membrane, which allows the influx of water and ions. Opsonization of bacteria by C3b and the recognition of foreign cells by pentraxins and MBL leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex, which lyses the bacteria or the cells they are attacking.",
  "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the catalytic component of gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) within the transmembrane domain to generate the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilin-1 is also involved in the cleavage of other type I transmembrane proteins, including the Notch receptor. Cleavage of Notch by gamma-secretase is required for Notch signaling, which regulates cell fate decisions during development. Presenilin-1 is also involved in the notch signaling pathway, but this role is independent of gamma-secretase activity. Presenilin-1 is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and calcium release. Presenilin-1 is a multi-spanning membrane protein that is thought to be involved in the transport of proteins through membranes. The cleavage of APP and Notch by gamma-secretase requires prior cleavage of the substrate by a different protease, termed the alpha-secretase for APP and the beta-secretase for Notch. The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase releases the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which aggregates to form senile plaques in the brains of patients with AD. The cleavage of Notch by gamma-secretase releases an intracellular domain that moves into the nucleus and activates transcription. The role of amyloid-beta in the pathogenesis of AD is still a matter of debate, but there is evidence that the amyloid-beta peptide may be toxic to neurons and may also interfere with synaptic function.",
  "The protease activated receptors (PAR) are a family of four G-protein coupled receptors activated by proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminus of the receptor by the serine protease thrombin. The PAR receptors are activated by tethered ligand peptides that are released upon receptor cleavage. The PAR-1 receptor is activated by the protease thrombin and also by the peptide SFLLRN. PAR-2 is activated by trypsin and by the peptide SLIGKV. PAR-3 is activated by trypsin and by the peptide TFRGAP. PAR-4 is activated by trypsin and by the peptide GMSIPQ. The tethered ligand peptides are cleaved and inactivated by the same proteases that activate the PAR receptors. The PAR receptors are widely expressed in the body and are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes.

  "The release of Ca2 + from intracellular stores is a key event in the control of cellular function. The release of Ca2 + is triggered by the second messenger IP3, which is produced by the activation of phospholipase C (PL-C). The IP3 receptor (IP3R) is a ligand-gated channel that is located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The binding of IP3 to the IP3R leads to the release of Ca2 + from the ER into the cytoplasm. The depletion of ER Ca2 + stores activates the so-called Ca2 + release-activated Ca2 + (CRAC) channels, which are highly selective for Ca2 +. The CRAC channels are activated by depletion of ER Ca2 + stores and are responsible for the influx of extracellular Ca2 +. The influx of Ca2 + through CRAC channels is required for the refilling of the ER with Ca2 + and for the activation of various cellular responses. The activation of GPCRs leads to the production of the second messenger cAMP by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (AC). The activity of AC is regulated by the alpha-subunit of the G protein. Gs activates the AC isoform V, VI, and VIII, whereas Gi inhibits AC isoform III. The activation of AC leads to the production of the second messenger cAMP. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a heterotetramer consisting of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. The regulatory subunits inhibit the activity of the catalytic subunits when they are bound to cAMP. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant mechanism for the repair of small base lesions in DNA, including the most common DNA lesion, 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoG). BER is also responsible for the repair of 104 lesions per day caused by reactive oxygen species. BER can be separated into two subpathways based on the position of the lesion in the DNA. Lesions in the transcribed strand of genes are repaired by the so-called transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway. BER can also be separated into incision repair and gap-filling repair. For the repair of simple base lesions, DNA glycosylases initiate the first step of BER by hydrolyzing the N-glycosyl bond between the abnormal base and the deoxyribose. DNA glycosylases can be separated into two groups based on their substrate specificity. Monofunctional glycosylases hydrolyze the N-glycosyl bond without the cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone. Glycosylases with an associated AP lyase activity hydrolyze the N-glycosyl bond and cleave the DNA strand 5 'to the lesion. Glycosylases with an associated dRP lyase activity cleave the DNA strand 3' to the lesion and remove the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) group that is generated during the hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond. BER is completed by the insertion of a new base, DNA synthesis, and ligation. For the repair of 8oxoG, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) excises the damaged base and the resulting abasic site is incised by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) then fills in the gap and DNA ligase III (LIG3) seals the nick. 8oxoG can pair with adenine, resulting in a GC to TA mutation. MYH (MUTYH) excises adenine from 8oxodGTP, preventing its incorporation into the genome during replication.",
  "Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States, with an estimated 4 0, 8 8 0 new cases and 1 4, 5 8 0 deaths in 2 0 0 7. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 7 5% of all cases, and 1 5% of patients with NMIBC develop muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The standard treatment for NMIBC is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Approximately 7 0% of patients with NMIBC develop recurrent disease, and 1 5% progress to MIBC. The 5-year survival rate for patients with NMIBC is approximately 9 0%, but only approximately 5 0% for patients with MIBC. The most common cause of death in patients with MIBC is metastasis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of bladder cancer are not well understood. Several genetic alterations have been identified in bladder cancer, including activating mutations in H-RAS, K-RAS, and B-RAF, and inactivating mutations in p53 and RB. Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene has also been observed in bladder cancer. These genetic alterations may lead to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, contributing to the development of bladder cancer. In addition to genetic alterations, epigenetic changes, such as promoter hypermethylation, may play an important role in the development of bladder cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter regions silences the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation of the E-cadherin gene has been observed in invasive bladder cancer and may contribute to the invasive phenotype. The inactivation of the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) genes by promoter hypermethylation may contribute to the development of bladder cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation of multiple genes has been observed in bladder cancer, suggesting that aberrant DNA methylation may play a role in the development of bladder cancer.",
  "Interleukin 2 (IL2) is a cytokine that stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells. IL2 binds to a receptor on the surface of T cells and activates a signaling pathway that leads to T cell proliferation. The IL2 receptor is a heterodimer with two chains, alpha and beta. The beta chain is the ligand binding subunit and is also the signaling subunit. The alpha chain does not bind IL2 by itself, but is required for high affinity binding of IL2 to the receptor. The IL2 receptor activates several different signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT pathway and the MAPK pathway. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by IL2 through the JAK kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which phosphorylate and activate the STAT transcription factors. The MAPK pathway is activated by IL2 through the Ras pathway, leading to activation of the MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2. The Ras pathway also activates the transcription factor ELK-1, which is involved in the regulation of genes involved in T cell activation. The activation of these different pathways by IL2 through the IL2 receptor leads to T cell proliferation.",
  "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the presence of distinct genetic abnormalities in hematopoietic progenitor cells that result in the aberrant expression of genes that are normally expressed in more restricted patterns. The molecular mechanisms that lead to AML are diverse and include chromosomal translocations that result in the generation of fusion genes that play a central role in leukemogenesis. These fusion genes encode chimeric proteins that deregulate proliferation and / or differentiation of hematopoietic cells and / or induce apoptosis. In addition, mutations that affect signal transduction pathways are frequently found in AML. These mutations include those in FLT3, RAS, KIT, and N / K-RAS, PTPN1 1, and PTPN1 1.",
  "Neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA and acetylcholine are released from presynaptic neurons and bind to specific receptors on the surface of postsynaptic neurons. The receptors are coupled to G proteins and activate second messenger systems. The neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine activate G (s) proteins and stimulate the production of cAMP. The neurotransmitter glutamate activates G (q) proteins and stimulates the production of inositol phosphates. The activation of G (i) proteins inhibits the activity of adenylyl cyclase. The activation of G proteins by neurotransmitters can also lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The MAPKs are a family of serine / threonine protein kinases that are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The MAPKs are activated by a cascade of phosphorylation events. The MAPKs are activated by the phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues by the upstream kinases MEK kinase (MEKK), MEK kinase (MEKK) and Raf. The phosphorylation of the MAPKs is then terminated by the dephosphorylation of these residues by phosphatases. The activation of the MAPKs by neurotransmitters can be blocked by inhibitors of the G proteins, MEK and protein kinase C.",
  "Cell surface proteins can be attached to the cell membrane via a glycolipid structure called a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The GPI anchor is covalently attached to the C-terminus of proteins through a conserved structure, the GPI core structure. The biosynthesis of GPI anchors is a multistep process that starts with the attachment of N-acetylglucosaminyl (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI). GlcNAc is then modified by the addition of mannose (Man) residues, which are in turn modified by the addition of other sugars and phosphate residues. The GPI core structure is conserved in all eukaryotes. After the synthesis of the GPI precursor is completed, the GPI-anchor attachment site is recognized by a specific GPI-transamidase complex, which cleaves the C-terminus of the protein and replaces it with the preformed GPI. After the attachment of the GPI anchor, the GPI-anchored proteins are transported to the cell surface via the secretory pathway. In this review, we describe the biosynthesis of GPI anchors and the genes involved in this process.",
  "The transcription factor NFAT is a key regulator of cytokine gene expression in T cells. The activity of NFAT is regulated by the calcium / calmodulin dependent phosphatase calcineurin. In the absence of calcium, NFAT is retained in the cytoplasm by association with the proteins 14-3-3. Upon antigen receptor stimulation, calcium is mobilized from intracellular stores and enters the cell. Calcineurin is activated by calcium and dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus NFAT binds to the AP-1 site in the promoter of cytokine genes, and interacts with other transcription factors to activate transcription. The activity of NFAT is also regulated by phosphorylation. The kinase GSK-3 phosphorylates NFAT and causes it to be retained in the cytoplasm. The kinase p42-MAPK is also able to phosphorylate NFAT, causing it to be exported from the nucleus. The kinase PKC-theta is involved in the activation of NFAT by the T cell receptor, and is activated by the scaffold protein CARMA1.",
  "ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 2 0-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are members of the Ras GTPase superfamily. They are involved in intracellular vesicular transport and in the regulation of phospholipase D. The six known human ARF proteins (ARFA-1C, -1B, -1C1-2, -1C2, -1D1, -1D2) are encoded by different chromosomes and are classified into three groups based on sequence similarity: class I (ARFA-1C1, -1C2), class II (ARFA-1D1, -1D2), and class III (ARFA-1C1, -1D2). The three groups share 2 5-3 0% sequence identity and are structurally divided into an N-terminal domain containing the GTP-binding site, a middle domain containing a Sec7 domain, and a C-terminal domain containing the putative lipid modification site and the Rho-like GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain. The Sec7 domain catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP in ARFs, and the Rho-like GAP domain stimulates the GTPase activity of ARFs. The PH domain is a lipid-binding domain that is involved in membrane recruitment of proteins containing PH domains. The cytohesins are a subfamily of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for ARF proteins that also contain a PH domain, ankyrin repeats, and a conserved C-terminal domain that is similar to the product of the tumor suppressor gene p130. The cytohesins are found in all vertebrates and are expressed in a variety of tissues. The cytohesin-1 PH domain binds phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3), and this interaction is required for the efficient activation of the exchange activity of cytohesin-1 by PI (3, 4, 5) P3. The PH domain also contributes to the autoinhibition of cytohesin-1. The crystal structure of the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1 in complex with GDP-bound ARF1GDP revealed the molecular basis for the specificity of the Sec7 domain for the ARF family of GTPases. The Sec7 domain forms a dimer with a 2-fold symmetry, and each monomer contributes one of the two nucleotide-binding sites. The structure of the complex also revealed the basis for the specificity of the cytohesin-1 Sec7 domain for the ARF GTPases. The PH domain of cytohesin-1 binds PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3, and this interaction may help to recruit cytohesin-1 to the plasma membrane. The PH domain also contributes to the autoinhibition of cytohesin-1. The binding of PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3 to the PH domain may induce a conformational change that exposes the binding site for the Sec7 domain. The crystal structure of the PH domain of cytohesin-3 in complex with Ins (1, 3, 4, 5) P4 revealed the molecular basis for the specific recognition of PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3 by the PH domain of cytohesin-3. The crystal structure of the PH domain of cytohesin-2 in complex with Ins (1, 3, 4, 5) P4 revealed the molecular basis for the specific recognition of PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3 by the PH domain of cytohesin-2. The PH domain of cytohesin-2 also contributes to the autoinhibition of cytohesin-2. The binding of PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3 to the PH domain may induce a conformational change that exposes the binding site for the Sec7 domain.",
  "The human papilloma virus (HPV) is a DNA virus that infects squamous epithelial cells and can cause cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 proteins encoded by HPV are the major viral oncoproteins that are required for cellular transformation. E6 binds to the tumor suppressor protein p5 3 and targets it for degradation. E6 also binds to the ubiquitin ligase E6AP, which targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. E7 binds to the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and disrupts the interaction of Rb with the transcription factor E2F-1, releasing the transcription factor E2F-1 to induce S phase and cellular proliferation. E6 and E7 also interact with the transcription factor AP-1, which may also contribute to cellular transformation. E6 and E7 also activate transcription of the hTERT gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein that adds multiple nucleotides to the ends of chromosomes and is required for cellular immortalization. E6 and E7 also activate the transcription of the cellular genes involved in DNA replication and repair, which may contribute to cellular transformation. E6 and E7 also activate the transcription factor AP-1, which may contribute to cellular transformation by inducing expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation. The ability of E6 and E7 to transform cells requires the expression of the cellular transcription factor AP-1. The activation of AP-1 by E6 and E7 may be mediated by the induction of c-Fos and c-Jun. The activation of AP-1 by E6 and E7 may also contribute to cellular immortalization by inducing expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is required for cellular immortalization.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily consists of a large group of structurally related secreted cytokines that regulate a broad spectrum of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGF-beta is a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell growth and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor. TGF-beta signals through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors. Binding of TGF-beta to its receptor complex results in the phosphorylation and activation of the type I receptor kinase, which in turn activates the type II receptor kinase. The activated type I receptor phosphorylates receptor-associated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs), including SMAD2 and SMAD3. R-SMAD proteins bind to SMAD4 and the complex is then translocated to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of target genes. Inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs), including SMAD6 and SMAD7, antagonize the TGF-beta pathway by binding to activated type I receptors and preventing the phosphorylation of R-SMADs. SMAD6 and SMAD7 also interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF-1, targeting them for degradation.",
  "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I, which is further cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form angiotensin II. Angiotensinogen and ACE are both synthesized in the liver, and are transported to the kidneys, where they are filtered by the glomeruli and then secreted into the tubular lumen. In the tubular lumen, angiotensinogen is cleaved by the protease cathepsin D, which is secreted by the tubular cells. The filtered angiotensinogen is then absorbed by the proximal tubular cells and cleaved by cathepsin D to form angiotensin I. This is then cleaved by ACE to form angiotensin II, which is secreted into the tubular lumen. Angiotensin II binds to its receptor in the tubular cells, stimulating the secretion of sodium and water into the tubular lumen. The increased water and sodium in the tubular lumen then pass into the bladder through the kidneys, increasing blood pressure. The importance of the RAS in blood pressure regulation is demonstrated by the fact that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are effective antihypertensive drugs.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Viral infection is detected by host cells through recognition of viral nucleic acids by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Upon recognition of viral nucleic acids, cellular signaling pathways are activated that lead to the production of type I interferon (IFN) and other cytokines, which in turn activate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), resulting in an antiviral state in infected cells and neighboring cells. This process is called the 'IFN amplification loop'.",
  "The high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) is a key regulator of allergic responses. Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI by antigen-antibody complexes on the surface of mast cells leads to the release of inflammatory mediators that cause allergic reactions. The activation of mast cells also leads to the production of cytokines that can affect the immune system in a variety of ways. The Fc epsilon RI is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and is comprised of an alpha chain that binds IgE with high affinity, a beta chain, and two gamma chains. The cytoplasmic domains of the subunits are not homologous, but they do contain a number of motifs that are involved in signal transduction. Upon aggregation of Fc epsilon RI, the tyrosine kinase Lyn (Src family kinase) is activated and phosphorylates the beta and gamma subunits. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide docking sites for the binding of the SH2 domains of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and the adaptor protein Shc. SHP-1 and Shc are involved in the down-regulation of signaling pathways. SHIP is a negative regulator of signaling that hydrolyzes the lipid second messenger PIP3 to PIP2 and thus inhibits the activation of PI3 kinase. The activation of PI3 kinase leads to the activation of the kinase Akt and the transcription factor NF-AT. The activation of NF-AT leads to the production of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-4. The MAP kinase pathway is also involved in the activation of mast cells. The activation of MAP kinase pathways by Fc epsilon RI is dependent on the activity of Lyn. The activation of Lyn leads to the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein LAT and the subsequent activation of the Map kinase pathway. The Map kinase pathways are involved in the regulation of cytokine production by mast cells.",
  "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) / AKT pathway is activated by a variety of growth factors and is involved in cell survival. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family of proteins binds to and inhibits caspases, the proteases that induce apoptosis. The PI3K / AKT pathway also activates the NF-kappaB pathway, which promotes cell survival. The PI3K / AKT pathway also phosphorylates the transcription factor FKHRL1, which induces expression of the IAP protein survivin. The heat shock protein 9 0 (HSP9 0) is involved in the folding of proteins and is required for the stability and activity of a number of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival. The HSP9 0 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) induces the degradation of several of these proteins, including AKT, and is cytotoxic to tumor cells. The activity of GA is enhanced by the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which is required for GA uptake by tumor cells.

The degradation of AKT is also blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG1 3 2, indicating that the degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The degradation of AKT by GA is specific, as other proteins that are dependent on HSP9 0 for stability are not affected.

  "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) / AKT pathway is a key regulator of cell survival and proliferation. The pathway is activated by growth factor receptors and by loss of tumor suppressors. AKT is a key downstream effector of PI3K. AKT phosphorylates a variety of substrates involved in cell survival and proliferation. Phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD by AKT inhibits its interaction with the antiapoptotic protein BCL-XL, thus promoting cell survival. AKT also phosphorylates the forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1 and FKHRL2, which induce the expression of proapoptotic genes. Another substrate of AKT is the MDM2 protein, which promotes the degradation of the tumor suppressor p53. Another substrate of AKT is p07, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The phosphorylation of p07 by AKT inhibits its growth inhibitory activity.",
  "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with a poor prognosis. The majority of patients suffer from AML de novo, but a small percentage of patients suffer from AML following a myelodysplastic phase (MDS). The molecular pathogenesis of AML is complex and heterogeneous. Several different classes of mutations have been identified in AML, including mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinases FLT3 and c-Kit, mutations in the RAS genes, and mutations in the NPM1 gene. The most common cytogenetic abnormalities in AML are translocations involving the MLL gene at chromosome 1 1q2 3, which is involved in de novo AML as well as in therapy-related AML (t-AML), and the AML-associated genes AML1 / ETO and CBF1ME. The MLL gene is involved in the regulation of HOX genes, which are involved in embryonic development and haematopoiesis. The AML1 / ETO fusion protein interferes with the normal function of transcription factors involved in haematopoiesis.",
  "Cytokines are soluble factors that are secreted by various cell types and act on other cells to regulate a broad spectrum of biological responses. Cytokines are classified into distinct groups on the basis of their structure and the receptors they bind. The hematopoietic cytokines are grouped into two major categories: the hematopoietin group, which includes erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the IL-6 family, which includes IL-6, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, LIF, and OSM. Cytokines exert their biological functions by binding to specific cell-surface receptors. The receptors for hematopoietins are members of the hematopoietin receptor family, whereas the IL-6 family receptors are members of the IL-6 receptor family. Binding of cytokines to their receptors leads to the activation of associated protein tyrosine kinases, the Janus kinases (JAKs), which in turn phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on the receptor and / or associated proteins. The phosphorylated receptors then serve as docking sites for the recruitment and activation of downstream signaling molecules, including the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The JAK / STAT pathway is a major signaling pathway used by cytokines to transmit their biological effects. Other pathways activated by cytokines include the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of biochemical reactions resulting in the formation of a clot at the site of vascular injury. The coagulation cascade is initiated by tissue factor (TF), which is expressed at low levels on the surface of cells in the absence of vascular injury. Tissue injury results in the exposure of the plasma proteins fibrinogen and prothrombin, which are in their soluble form in plasma. Thrombin is formed from prothrombin by the action of the prothrombinase complex, which is formed by the binding of factor Va to factor Xa and factor Va. The prothrombinase complex is activated by the TF-factor VIIa complex, which is formed by the binding of TF to factor VIIa. The activation of factor X by the TF-factor VIIa complex and factor Xa results in the formation of thrombin, which cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin monomers. The polymerization of these monomers leads to the formation of a clot.",
  "B cells are the key players in adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete antibodies to fight against foreign antigens. They also present antigens to T cells to stimulate the immune response. The B cell receptor (BCR) is a multi-molecular complex that is composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) and light (L) chains, Ig-alpha and Ig-beta. The BCR is coupled to downstream signaling pathways through Ig-alpha and Ig-beta. The BCR is activated by binding of antigen to the Ig variable region, which triggers the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in Ig-alpha and Ig-beta by the Src family kinases Lyn and Fyn. The phosphorylated ITAMs recruit the tandem SH2-containing tyrosine kinase Syk, which in turn activates several downstream signaling pathways, including the phospholipase C (PLC) -gamma 2 pathway and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) -Akt pathway. These pathways lead to the activation of nuclear factor-AT (NFAT), nuclear factor-KB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which are important for B cell proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The Fas receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Fas-induced apoptosis is involved in the regulation of the immune system and may play a role in autoimmune disease. The Fas receptor is expressed on a variety of cell types including lymphocytes, macrophages, and neurons. Binding of Fas ligand (FasL) on an adjacent cell activates the Fas receptor and initiates apoptosis. The Fas-FasL interaction is also involved in cytotoxic T cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells. The Fas-FasL interaction also plays a role in the rejection of transplanted tissue and may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The Fas receptor is a 4 9-kDa type I integral membrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain homologous to that of the tumor necrosis factor receptor. The cytoplasmic domain contains a death domain that is required for apoptosis signaling by the Fas receptor. The Fas-associated death domain (FADD) is an adaptor protein that binds to the Fas death domain and is required for Fas-mediated apoptosis. FADD also contains a death effector domain that interacts with another adaptor protein, procaspase-8. Binding of FADD to the Fas receptor brings procaspase-8 into proximity, allowing its activation. Caspase-8 activates downstream caspases, including caspase-3, that cleave cellular targets and induce apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins includes both anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, A1, and Bfl-1) and pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bid, Bik, and Noxa) members. The Bcl-2 family members form a complex network of interactions that regulate apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family interact with FADD and / or procaspase-8 to inhibit apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members interact with the mitochondrial membrane to induce apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family also interacts with each other to regulate apoptosis. The mechanism by which the Bcl-2 family members regulate apoptosis is not yet clear, but may involve regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability and release of cytochrome c.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins plays a key role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. The Wnt pathway is involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Wnt proteins bind to the cell surface receptor Frizzled (Fz) and to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) or Lrp6. This interaction leads to the recruitment of Disheveled (DSH) and the stabilization of beta-catenin. Beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it associates with TCF / LEF family transcription factors and activates the transcription of target genes. Wnt / beta-catenin signaling is negatively regulated by a set of proteins, including Axin, APC, and the sodiophilic frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs). Wnt / beta-catenin signaling is also positively regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which involves the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1 and the protein kinase JNK. Wnt / PCP signaling regulates the cytoskeleton and cell motility.",
  "The peptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) is a key regulator of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Ang II exerts its effects through two receptors, AT1 and AT2. The AT1 receptor is coupled to Gq / 1 1, stimulating the inositol phosphate pathway and the release of intracellular calcium, and activating protein kinase C. The AT2 receptor is coupled to Gi / o and is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. Ang II also activates MAP kinase pathways through both AT1 and AT2 receptors. The AT1 receptor activates the ras / raf / Mek / Erk pathway, while the AT2 receptor activates the p38 pathway. The AT1 receptor also activates the p38 pathway through the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 and the small G protein rac. Ang II also activates the p38 pathway through G-protein independent mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Ang II induces hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac fibroblasts through the p38 pathway. Ang II also stimulates proliferation of many cell types through the ras / map kinase pathway. The p38 pathway may also be involved in Ang II induced apoptosis.",
  "The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) family of transcription factors plays a key role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. In most cells, NF-kB is retained in the cytoplasm by association with the inhibitor protein IkBa. Various stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, viral infection, and the phorbol ester PMA activate the IKK kinase complex, which phosphorylates IkBa, targeting it for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. This results in the release and nuclear translocation of NF-kB, which then activates transcription of target genes. The activation of NF-kB by the T cell costimulatory receptor, CTLA-4, is independent of IKK activation, but requires the protein kinase MEKK1. MEKK1 activates the JNK pathway, which also leads to NF-kB activation.",
  "Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene IT1 5. The HD mutation results in a long stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) near the N-terminus of the HD gene product, huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) is widely expressed throughout the body, but its toxicity is most pronounced in neurons. Mutant Htt (exp) is prone to cleavage by proteases, and the resulting N-terminal fragments are prone to misfolding and aggregation. The presence of expanded polyQ in Htt leads to a loss of normal Htt function. The loss of normal Htt function may be related to the role of Htt in vesicular transport. The gain of toxic function may be related to the aberrant protein-protein interactions of mHtt. The formation of aggregates may interfere with normal cellular functions. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cytosol and nucleus leads to proteasome and / or mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn may cause more protein misfolding and aggregation. These events may then feed forward into more protein misfolding and aggregation, resulting in a self-propagating cycle of protein misfolding and aggregation.",
  "Axon guidance is a crucial process in the formation of neuronal network. Axons are guided by attractive and repulsive guidance cues in their environment. Axons are attracted to their targets by attractive cues, such as netrins, and are repelled by repellent cues, such as ephrins. Axons are also guided by a variety of intermediate targets, such as growth cones. Axons are guided by ephrins and netrins expressed on the surface of guideposts. Ephrins and their receptors are divided into two classes, EphAs and EphBs, and ephrins and their receptors, EphRs. The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) are activated by ephrins. The Eph signaling pathway is complex and involves multiple downstream signaling cascades. The interaction of ephrins and Eph receptors can lead to two distinct signaling pathways. The contact-mediated forward signaling pathway involves the interaction of Eph receptors on the axonal surface with ephrins on the surface of the adjacent cells. This pathway is involved in the initial attraction of the growing axon. The contact-independent reverse signaling pathway involves the cleavage of the ephrins' cytoplasmic domain. This pathway is involved in the retraction of the growth cone.",
  "Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine that is produced by stromal cells in the bone marrow and is critical for the development and proliferation of B and T cells. The IL-7 receptor is expressed on immature B and T cells and the binding of IL-7 to the receptor activates several signaling pathways. One pathway activated by IL-7 is the PI3 kinase pathway. PI3 kinase activation by IL-7 leads to the activation of Akt and the inhibition of apoptosis. Another pathway activated by IL-7 is the JAK / STAT pathway. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by IL-7 and leads to the activation of STAT5 and the induction of genes such as p300 and p21. The activation of p300 and p21 leads to the activation of NF-AT and the induction of genes such as cyclin D2. The activation of the JAK / STAT and PI3 kinase pathways by IL-7 leads to the induction of genes that lead to the proliferation and survival of B and T cells.",
  "Glycolysis is a fundamental metabolic pathway that produces ATP and other essential metabolites. It consists of eleven reactions, each of which involves the transfer of a phosphate group from a high-energy phosphate compound to a low-energy phosphate compound. The phosphate group is either from a phosphate group donor (ATP) or from a proton (H +). The phosphate donors are ADP, NAD +, and Pi. The phosphate acceptors are carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and alcohols. The reactions are shown in the lower part of glycolysis. The upper part of glycolysis converts glyceraldehyde-3P to glycerate-3P, which is then converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Pyruvate is then formed from PEP and is reduced to form lactate. The conversion of glucose to pyruvate is catalyzed by the enzyme hexokinase. There are two forms of hexokinase, a constitutive form (HKII) and an inducible form (HKI). The inducible form is expressed at high levels in liver and kidney in response to a variety of stimuli, including hormones, diet, and exercise. The enzyme phosphofructo-kinase (PFK) catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis, the conversion of fructose-6P to fructose-1P. There are three forms of PFK, each of which is a homotetramer. The form expressed in bacteria and invertebrates is inhibited by ATP and activated by AMP. The form expressed in vertebrates is less sensitive to these effectors. The third form is expressed in muscle and is less sensitive to these effectors. The enzyme enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. There are two forms of enolase, each of which is a homodimer. The muscle form of enolase is less sensitive to inhibition by ATP and inhibition by Pi. The final step of glycolysis is the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). There are two forms of LDH, each of which is a homodimer. One form is expressed constitutively (LDH-A), and the other form is expressed in muscle and is expressed at high levels during exercise (LDH-B).",
  "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a class of nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. The PPAR family consists of three members, PPARalpha, PPARbeta / delta (also known as PPARbeta / delta), and PPARgamma. PPARalpha is expressed in the liver, kidney, heart, and brown adipose tissue, and is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. PPARbeta / delta is expressed in a broad range of tissues, and is involved in lipid metabolism and cellular differentiation. PPARgamma is expressed in adipose tissue and is involved in adipocyte differentiation. The three subtypes of PPAR bind to fatty acids and their derivatives as ligands. The binding of fatty acids and their derivatives to PPARs induces conformational changes in the receptor, and the activated PPAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The PPAR / RXR heterodimer then binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, and regulates the expression of these genes. In addition to fatty acids and their derivatives, various synthetic compounds, including hypolipidemic drugs and prostaglandin J2, are ligands for PPARs. The expression of cytochrome P4 5 0 (CYP) genes is also regulated by PPARs. CYP2C9 is the major CYP enzyme involved in the metabolism of drugs, including warfarin. CYP2C9 is induced by all three PPAR subtypes through the direct binding of the PPAR / RXR heterodimer to a PPRE in the CYP2C9 gene. In addition to CYP2C9, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 are also induced by PPARalpha ligands. In contrast, PPARbeta / delta represses the induction of CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2E1 by PPARalpha ligands. The repression of CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 by PPARbeta / delta is mediated by the activation of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) / antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. PPARgamma represses the induction of CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2E1 by PPARalpha ligands. The repression is mediated by the inhibition of the PPARalpha-mediated activation of the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genes.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit complex that recognizes specific peptide antigens in the context of MHC molecules on the surface of other cells. The TCR is composed of two heterodimers, each containing one alpha and one beta chain. The alpha chain also associates with the CD28 co-receptor. The CD3 complex is associated with the TCR complex and is required for its expression and function. The zeta chains of the TCR complex contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that are phosphorylated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn upon TCR engagement. The phosphorylated ITAMs recruit the ZAP-7 0 protein tyrosine kinase to the receptor complex, which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets. The activation of T cells requires two signals. The first signal is provided by the interaction of the TCR with peptide antigen in the context of MHC. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of the TCR zeta chains by Lck and Fyn and the recruitment of ZAP-7 0 to the receptor complex. ZAP-7 0 phosphorylates downstream targets that activate the T cell. The second signal is provided by the interaction of the T cell co-receptor CD28 with the T cell surface molecule LFA-1. This interaction also activates Lck and Fyn and may result in the phosphorylation of the TCR zeta chains. The phosphorylation of the TCR zeta chains may be required for the full T cell activation.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophin family that regulates neuronal survival and differentiation. In addition to its well-established role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, NGF has been implicated in a variety of other processes, including immune function, inflammation, and the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative disorders. The biological effects of NGF are mediated by TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Upon NGF binding, TrkA is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, activating several signaling cascades. The first pathway activated is the Ras / Raf / mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which leads to the activation of the transcription factor CREB. Another pathway activated by NGF is the PI3-kinase / Akt pathway, which leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Other pathways activated by NGF include the phospholipase C (PLC) -gamma pathway, which leads to the activation of PKC and the calcineurin / NFAT pathway.",
  "Cytokines are soluble factors that are secreted by cells and act on other cells. Cytokines are classified into two groups: cytokines that are secreted by lymphocytes (cytokines that mediate cellular immunity) and cytokines that are secreted by nonlymphocytes (cytokines that mediate humoral immunity). Cytokines are involved in a wide variety of biological functions, including development and differentiation of cells, cell growth and proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inflammation. Cytokines are produced by various types of cells and act on cells through specific receptors. Cytokines that are secreted by lymphocytes include interleukins (IL), interferons (IFN), growth factors (GF), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF). Cytokines that are secreted by nonlymphocytes include erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), prolactin (PRL), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), leptin, and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Cytokines act on cells through specific receptors. The receptors for cytokines are generally composed of two subunits. Some cytokines have two subunits in a complex, such as IL-2 and IL-10. Other cytokines have a single subunit, such as the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor. The subunits of cytokine receptors are diverse in structure and are classified into two groups: the ligand-specific subunits and the subunits shared by several cytokines. The ligand-specific subunits are usually glycoproteins that bind cytokines with high affinity. The subunits of the shared receptors are transmembrane proteins that bind cytokines with lower affinity.",
  "DNA damage activates checkpoint signaling pathways that block cell cycle progression to allow time for DNA repair to occur. The ATM kinase and the ATR kinase respond to DNA damage by activating downstream signaling pathways that block cell cycle progression and induce DNA repair. The ATM kinase is mutated in patients with the cancer-prone disease ataxia telangiectasia. The ATR kinase is related to ATM and is required for cell cycle checkpoint control in response to DNA damage. The ATR kinase is activated by DNA damage and by replication blocks. The ATR kinase phosphorylates the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2, which in turn phosphorylate and regulate downstream targets to block cell cycle progression and induce DNA repair. The breast cancer susceptibility gene product BRCA2 is also phosphorylated by the ATR kinase in response to DNA damage. The breast cancer susceptibility gene product BRCA1 is required for DNA repair and checkpoint control. The breast cancer susceptibility gene product p53 is involved in checkpoint control and DNA repair. The p53 protein interacts with the checkpoint kinase Chk1 and is required for the activation of Chk1 by ATR in response to DNA damage. The p53 gene is also mutated in patients with the cancer-prone disease Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The p53 protein interacts with the breast cancer susceptibility gene product BRCA1. The interaction of p53 with BRCA1 may regulate the DNA repair activity of BRCA1.",
  "The progression of prostate cancer from an androgen-dependent state to an androgen-independent state is a major cause of prostate cancer mortality. The progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer is associated with the emergence of androgen-independent tumor cells, which no longer depend on androgen for growth and survival. The androgen-independent prostate cancer cells express high levels of the androgen receptor (AR) and are able to proliferate in the absence of androgen. The AR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is activated by androgen antagonists such as flutamide and bicalutamide. However, in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, the AR is still required for the proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells. The AR is also a phosphoprotein and undergoes phosphorylation by protein kinases, including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and MAPK. Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of AR activity. The AR is also regulated by protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates the AR and inhibits its activity. Dephosphorylation of the AR by protein phosphatase 2A may contribute to the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module of kinases that transmits signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. The MAPK cascade is activated by growth factors, cytokines, and neurotransmitters, and is involved in a variety of cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The MAPK cascade is initiated by activation of a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, which leads to the activation of Ras and the Raf family of protein kinases. Activated Raf phosphorylates and activates Mek1 and Mek2, which in turn activate Erk1 and Erk2. The activated Erks translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription through phosphorylation of transcription factors such as Elk-1. The duration and strength of the signal is regulated by phosphatases and by the action of specific inactivators such as p27. The p27 protein is induced by the MAPK pathway and acts as a feedback inhibitor to attenuate the signal. The p27 protein binds to and inhibits the Mek1 and Mek2 kinases, and also induces the degradation of the Mek1 and Mek2 kinases. The p21 protein is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that is induced by the MAPK pathway and acts as a checkpoint to prevent the cell from entering S phase if the pathway is not activated.",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems. The hallmark of SLE is the production of autoantibodies to nuclear antigens. The presence of these autoantibodies is a key feature of SLE. Autoantibodies are directed against nuclear proteins such as DNA, histones, and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). The presence of these autoantibodies is associated with the formation of immune complexes that are deposited in tissues and cause organ damage.",
  "The G2 / M checkpoint prevents the cell from entering mitosis (M phase) if the genome is damaged or the cell is incompletely replicated. The G2 / M checkpoint is activated by DNA damage and by incomplete DNA replication. The checkpoint prevents the activation of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), which is a complex of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and cyclin B. MPF is required for the transition from G2 to M phase. The activation of MPF is regulated by the opposing activities of the kinases, Wee1 and Cdc2 5. When MPF is active, it is phosphorylated and activated by the kinases Myt1 and Cdc25C. When MPF is inactive, it is dephosphorylated and the kinases are phosphorylated by the protein phosphatase PP2A. The activation of the DNA damage checkpoint inhibits the activation of MPF by blocking the degradation of cyclin B. In the absence of DNA damage, the ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin B for degradation is activated by the APC. In the presence of DNA damage, the kinase Chk2 is activated by ATM and phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor p5 3. The activated p5 3 induces the expression of the protein Wip1, which dephosphorylates and deactivates the kinase Cdc2 5C. The dephosphorylation of Cdc2 5C by Wip1 prevents the activation of MPF by Cdc2 5C and the subsequent activation of MPF. The inhibition of the APC by Wip1 also prevents the degradation of cyclin B. The inhibition of MPF activation by the DNA damage checkpoint prevents the initiation of mitosis and allows time for the cell to repair the damaged DNA.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid messenger that is generated by the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase (SPHK). S1P can be dephosphorylated to sphingosine by sphingosine phosphatases or it is N-acylated by sphingosine acyltransferase to form ceramide. S1P is a ligand for the Edg family of G-protein coupled receptors. S1P has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. The intracellular levels of S1P are regulated by the opposing actions of SPHK and the S1P lyase. SPHK1 is activated by a variety of growth factors and cytokines and is required for cell proliferation. S1P is degraded by S1P lyase, which cleaves the ethanolamine phosphate group to yield hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine. The S1P lyase is induced by stress and is required for cell death. The S1P receptor is coupled to Gi and inhibits adenylate cyclase, but also activates other signaling pathways including Rac and the MAP kinases. The S1P receptor is required for S1P-induced cell migration. The S1P lyase is required for S1P-induced inhibition of angiogenesis.",
  "The central nervous system (CNS) is an immune-privileged site, in part because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized endothelial cell layer that restricts the passage of circulating cells and molecules into the brain parenchyma. The BBB is formed by tight junctions between the endothelial cells, which prevent the paracellular diffusion of hydrophilic molecules and restrict the movement of lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion. In addition, specialized transport systems located at the luminal and abluminal membranes of the endothelial cells regulate the entry and exit of nutrients and immune cells into the CNS. The presence of the BBB is a major factor in the immune-privileged status of the CNS. The expression of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules on the abluminal side of the BBB endothelium suggests that activated T cells in the circulation can gain access to the CNS parenchyma. Furthermore, the expression of adhesion molecules and costimulatory molecules on the abluminal side of the BBB endothelium may allow the migration of activated T cells into the CNS parenchyma.",
  "The transcription factor NF-kB is a key regulator of apoptosis, inflammation, and immune responses. The activity of NF-kB is regulated by IkB kinase (IkB kinase), which phosphorylates IkBalpha, causing IkBalpha to be degraded by the proteosome. The degradation of IkBalpha allows NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The activation of NF-kB by TNF-alpha is mediated by the IkB kinase complex, which also phosphorylates IkB, including the activation of map kinase pathways. The map kinase pathway includes MEKK1, SEK1, and Rsk-2. The map kinase pathway also activates NF-kB by a mechanism independent of the IkB kinase complex. The transcription factor Sp1 is also involved in the activation of the HIV LTR. The activity of Sp1 is regulated by phosphorylation, and the activation of the HIV LTR by Sp1 is also mediated by the phosphorylation of Sp1. The activation of the HIV LTR by Sp1 and NF-kB is inhibited by the cellular kinase p53. The cellular kinase p53 is induced by a variety of stress signals, including the DNA damaging agent adriamycin, and activates the HIV LTR by phosphorylating Sp1 and inducing the activity of NF-kB. The activation of the HIV LTR by p53 may contribute to the activation of HIV by stress signals.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway for the repair of small base lesions, such as the oxidation or alkylation of bases, in DNA. BER is initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that recognize and excise the damaged base, generating an abasic site. The abasic site is then cleaved by an AP endonuclease, and the resulting gap is filled by a DNA polymerase and sealed by a DNA ligase. BER is a multi-enzyme pathway, and in humans, there are at least three different DNA polymerases (pol beta, pol eta, and pol lambda) and at least two different DNA ligases (DNA ligase I and DNA ligase III) that participate in BER.",
  "The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-bound ligands, the ephrins, are involved in a variety of developmental processes, including cell migration, axon guidance, and tissue boundary formation. Eph receptors are also involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility, and have been implicated in cancer progression. The ephrin ligands are also membrane bound, and interact with the extracellular matrix. The Eph-ephrin interaction is highly specific, and is dependent on the interaction of the extracellular domain of the Eph receptor with the extracellular domain of the ephrin ligand. The ephrins are also membrane bound, and interact with the extracellular matrix. The ephrins are divided into two groups, the A ephrins, which are tethered to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and the B ephrins, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in a variety of tissues, but are most highly expressed in the nervous system. The interaction of the Eph receptors and ephrins is bidirectional, with the Eph receptor signaling in both directions. The Eph receptors are tyrosine kinases, and their activation transduces a signal in both directions. In the forward direction, the Eph receptor phosphorylates its ligand, and the signal is transduced down the same pathway down the receptor. In the reverse direction, the phosphorylated Eph receptor also transduces a signal down the same pathway, by phosphorylating downstream targets. The Eph-ephrin interaction is highly specific, and is dependent on the interaction of the extracellular domain of the Eph receptor with the extracellular domain of the ephrin ligand.

  "Coagulation factor V is a cofactor for the serine protease factor VIII. When activated by thrombin, factor V and factor VIII form a complex that activates factor X in the presence of calcium. The activation of factor X by the factor V-factor VIII complex is inhibited by antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by antithrombin III and protein C is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Activated protein C cleaves and inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by protein C is enhanced by protein S. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by antithrombin III is enhanced by heparin. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by heparin is mediated by the high affinity binding of antithrombin III to the pentasaccharide sequence in heparin. The inhibition of factor X activation by the protein C system is also enhanced by the presence of thrombomodulin on the vascular endothelium. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by the antithrombin III-heparin system is also enhanced by high molecular weight kininogen. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by the protein C system is also enhanced by prekallikrein. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by the antithrombin III-heparin system is also enhanced by high molecular weight kininogen. The inhibition of the factor V-factor VIII complex by the protein C system is also enhanced by the presence of activated platelets.",
  "The release of the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), is a key regulatory process in the endocrine system. The secretion of these hormones is stimulated by the hypothalamic decapeptide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The secretion of the gonadotropins is pulsatile, with a pulse frequency that is dependent on the species and the physiological state of the animal. The frequency of the pulses is regulated by the level of GnRH in the portal circulation. The GnRH receptor is coupled to the Gq / 1 1 class of G proteins, which activate phospholipase C through the generation of the second messengers IP3 and DAG. IP3 binds to its receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing calcium from this organelle. The increase in intracellular calcium stimulates calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which in turn activates the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). The increase in intracellular calcium also activates calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE1), which hydrolyzes cAMP to 5 '-AMP. The increase in cAMP activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which activates the transcription of the glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit (alphaSU) gene. The activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) also stimulates the expression of the LH beta-subunit gene. The activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK1 / 2) pathway is also involved in the regulation of the alphaSU and LH beta-subunit genes.",
  "The mu opioid receptor (MOP) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) gene family. It is activated by the endogenous opioid peptides enkephalins and endorphins, as well as the synthetic opiate drugs morphine and heroin. The endogenous ligands are cleaved from larger precursors and act at the receptor to produce their physiological effects. The receptor is expressed in the central nervous system and the periphery by neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem to produce analgesia and other physiological effects. The receptor is also found in many other tissues, including immune cells, where it may produce other physiological effects. The MOP receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that activates the Gi / o family of G proteins to produce its physiological effects. The receptor is phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs) in response to agonist binding, recruiting arrestins to the receptor to terminate further G protein activation. The receptor-arrestin complex internalizes, and the arrestin can interact with signaling molecules, including the MAP kinase pathways, to produce other receptor effects. The receptor can also desensitize without internalization, desensitize and internalize with different GRKs, and desensitize with different GRKs in different cell types. The receptor is also regulated by other GPCRs, including the delta opioid receptor (DOP), which can act as a phosphorylation-dependent and -independent regulator of the receptor. The receptor can also be regulated by other GPCRs, including the kappa opioid receptor (KOP), which can act as a phosphorylation-independent regulator of the receptor. The regulation of the MOP receptor by multiple factors produces the complex regulation of the receptor that produces the physiological effects of the endogenous ligands and the drugs that act at the receptor.",
  "The calpain family of calcium-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases is comprised of two large subunits (8 0kDa and 2 8kDa) and two small subunits (30kDa and 18kDa). The large subunits contain the protease domain and the small subunits are involved in the regulation of the activity of the large subunits. Calpain is activated by calcium and inhibited by calpastatin. The large subunits of calpain are involved in a variety of cellular functions including cell motility, cell adhesion, signal transduction, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Calpain is activated by the release of the 30kDa subunit from the large subunit. The release of the 30kDa subunit exposes the active site of the large subunit and allows autocatalysis to proceed. Calpain is inhibited by calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor. The large subunits of calpain are encoded by nine different genes. The tissue distribution of the different calpains is regulated by the different large subunits. The small subunits are encoded by two genes, m- and micro-calpain. The expression of the two small subunits is regulated independently. The large subunit of mu-calpain is encoded by the CAPN1 gene and the large subunit of m-calpain is encoded by the CAPN2 gene. The expression of the small subunit is regulated independently for mu-calpain and m-calpain. The expression of the mu-calpain small subunit is regulated by the CAPN4 gene. The expression of the m-calpain small subunit is regulated by the CAPN2 gene. The expression of the two small subunits is regulated independently. The regulation of the expression of the different calpain large and small subunits is complex. The expression of the different large and small subunits is regulated by different promoters and enhancers. The expression of the large subunits is regulated by the same promoter and the same enhancer. The expression of the small subunits is regulated by different promoters and different enhancers. The expression of the large and small subunits is regulated differently during development. The expression of the large subunits is high in undifferentiated cells and decreases as cells differentiate. The expression of the small subunits is high in differentiated cells. The expression of the large subunits is regulated by the same promoter and enhancer as the expression of the small subunits. The expression of the small subunits is regulated differently during development. The expression of the mu-calpain small subunit is regulated by the CAPN4 gene. The expression of the micro-calpain small subunit is regulated by the CAPN2 gene.",
  "Myocarditis is a disease of the heart muscle that results from various causes, including viral infection. Viral myocarditis is the most common cause of heart failure in young adults. Myocarditis can be caused by direct cytopathic effects of the virus, or by an autoimmune response to viral antigens. Viral myocarditis is associated with a high incidence of sudden death and heart failure. Myocarditis is characterized by myocardial inflammation and injury. Viral infection can result in direct cytopathic effects, such as necrosis and apoptosis, or indirect effects, such as the induction of an autoimmune response. Viral infection can also result in the activation of self-antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which leads to the activation of self-reactive T cells. Activated self-reactive T cells can cause direct myocardial injury or can be cytotoxic to cardiomyocytes through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Viral infection can also result in the activation of self-antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which leads to the activation of self-reactive T cells. Activated self-reactive T cells can cause direct myocardial injury or can be cytotoxic to cardiomyocytes through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
  "The hallmark of allergic disease is the infiltration of tissues by inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, activated Th2 cells and mast cells. The hallmark of allergic inflammation is the presence of Th2 cells, which produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-9. IL-5 and IL-9 are key cytokines that stimulate the growth and differentiation of eosinophils. Mast cells are central to the allergic response, secreting a variety of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. The activation of mast cells also leads to the release of cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators. The activation of eosinophils leads to the release of toxic granules, causing tissue damage and obstruction of the airway. The activation of eosinophils also leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines, stimulating the activation of other inflammatory cells.",
  "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Angiotensis II (Ang II), the active component of the RAS, is formed from the precursor angiotensinogen by the actions of renin and ACE. Ang II is a potent vasoconstrictor and a key regulator of blood pressure. The RAS is present in the heart and vasculature and is upregulated in heart failure. The cardiac RAS is activated in heart failure and may contribute to the progression of heart failure. Ang II increases collagen synthesis and deposition in the heart and may contribute to cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. ACE inhibitors block the formation of Ang II and block the actions of Ang II. ACE inhibitors are an important treatment for heart failure and have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. The cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors may be due in part to their effects on the cardiac RAS.",
  "Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrins activates intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and motility. The integrin cytoplasmic domain binds to the cytoskeleton and to a number of signaling molecules, including the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and Src. FAK is a key component of integrin signaling and is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in response to integrin engagement. FAK activation leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Src, which phosphorylates additional targets, including other components of focal adhesions. Paxillin is a target of FAK and Src and is involved in the regulation of cell motility. The adaptor protein Crk is recruited to FAK and paxillin and is phosphorylated by FAK and Src. Crk can associate with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DOCK1 8 0, which activates Rac, a small G protein that regulates the formation of lamellipodia and other actin-based structures. Paxillin also binds to the CrkL adaptor protein, which can activate the Ras pathway. Paxillin phosphorylation also leads to the recruitment of Csk, a kinase that phosphorylates Src and other substrates, to the complex. The phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and other targets by integrin signaling pathways may regulate cell survival, proliferation, and motility.",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved DNA repair mechanism that removes base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops (IDLs) generated during DNA replication. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations from being passed on to the next generation. Defects in MMR are associated with cancer in humans. The MMR pathway is composed of at least seven MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS1, and PMS2) in humans. MutS heterodimers (MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3) specifically bind to mismatches and recruit MutL heterodimers (MLH1-PMS2 and MLH1-PMS1) to the mismatch site. The exonuclease 1 (EXO1) is then recruited to the mismatch site by the MutS / MutL complex, excising the newly synthesized DNA strand containing the mismatch. The nicked strand is then resynthesized by DNA polymerases and ligases.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically programmed cell death pathway that is important for the removal of unwanted cells. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspases are initially expressed as proenzymes that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases are classified into two groups: the initiator caspases (caspase-8, -9, and -1 0) that are activated by a diverse array of apoptotic signals, and the effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) that are directly activated by the initiator caspases. Apoptotic signaling pathways can be triggered by either the death receptor pathway or the mitochondrial pathway. In the death receptor pathway, binding of ligands to death receptors such as Fas leads to the recruitment of initiator caspases such as caspase-8. Caspase-8 is activated through oligomerization and subsequent auto-cleavage. Activated caspase-8 cleaves and activates caspase-3, -6, and-7, which in turn cleave cellular substrates, leading to cell death. In the mitochondrial pathway, apoptotic signals such as DNA damage activate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3, -6, and-7. Caspase-3 and-7 cleave cellular substrates, leading to cell death. Caspase-8 and -9 are activated by the initiator caspase-2 and caspase-1 0, respectively. Caspase-8 and -9 activate caspase-3 through cleavage of Bid. The cleavage of DFFA-4 by caspase-3 removes its inhibitory effect on DFFA-6 / caspase-ase5, leading to activation of DFFA-6 / caspase-ase6 and-7. The cleavage of nuclear lamins by caspase-3 causes nuclear condensation, while the cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor (DFFA) by caspase-3 and-7 causes DNA fragmentation.",
  "The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is activated by its ligand SCF (also known as steel factor) and plays a key role in the development of hematopoietic cells, germ cells and melanocytes. The importance of KIT in hematopoiesis has been demonstrated by the phenotype of mice lacking KIT (W / W mice) and by the effect of KIT antagonists on normal hematopoiesis. Mice lacking KIT (W / W) are sterile and have few or no germ cells. W / W mice also have a marked reduction in the number of hematopoietic cells, with the most dramatic reduction in the hematopoietic stem cells. The number of hematopoietic stem cells in W / W mice is reduced by more than 1 0 0-fold. The defect in the hematopoietic stem cells in W / W mice can be corrected by transplantation of bone marrow cells from normal mice. The hematopoietic defect in W / W mice can be partially corrected by administration of SCF. The effect of SCF on hematopoiesis is likely mediated through its receptor KIT. Mice lacking KIT (W / W) die at an early stage of development. The defect in the development of melanocytes and germ cells in W / W mice is also reversed by the transplantation of normal bone marrow cells. The effect of KIT on hematopoiesis is mediated through its downstream signaling pathways. The tyrosine kinase activity of KIT is essential for its signaling function. The activation of KIT leads to the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of KIT. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for signaling molecules containing src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The adaptor protein Shc binds to phosphorylated tyrosine (Y) 7 1 9 of KIT and recruits Grb2 / Sos-1 complex to activate Ras / MAPK pathway. The binding of PI3 kinase to phosphorylated tyrosine (Y) 5 6 7 of KIT leads to the activation of PI3 kinase / AKT pathway. The adaptor protein APS binds to phosphorylated tyrosine (Y) 7 0 3 of KIT and may also recruit PI3 kinase to activate AKT pathway. The phosphorylation of tyrosine (Y) 9 3 6 of KIT recruits the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 to activate ras / MAPK pathway. The activation of PI3 kinase / AKT pathway may also contribute to the activation of transcription factors such as CREB and STAT5 by KIT. The activation of STAT5 by KIT may contribute to the survival of hematopoietic cells.",
  "Cell-matrix interactions are critical for cell migration and tissue morphogenesis. Cells at the leading edge of a migrating cell migrate by extending their leading edge in the form of lamellipodia and filopodia. The formation of these structures is dependent on the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrins. The ECM is a complex mixture of macromolecules, including collagen, laminin, and fibronectin, that provides structural support and signals to cells. Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-ECM interactions. The interaction of cells with the ECM initiates a signaling cascade that results in cytoskeletal reorganization and the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. The interaction of cells with the ECM also results in the formation of focal adhesions, which are points of cell-ECM contact that contain integrins, cytoskeletal proteins, and signaling molecules. The interaction of cells with the ECM also results in the activation of the ras family of small GTPases, including ras, rac, and rho, which regulate cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration. The interaction of cells with the ECM also activates the calcium-dependent protease calpain, which cleaves cytoskeletal and signaling proteins to regulate cell migration. Calpain is a calcium-dependent protease that is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration. Calpain is a heterodimer, consisting of a large catalytic subunit (8 0kDa) and a small regulatory subunit (3 0kDa). Calpain is involved in the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, and in the formation of focal adhesions. Calpain cleaves spectrin, which is a component of the cytoskeleton, and talin, which is involved in focal adhesion formation. The interaction of cells with the ECM also activates the small GTPase rho, which regulates the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. Calpain is also involved in the activation of the ras family of small GTPases, including ras, rac, and rho. Calpain cleaves the GDP-bound inactive form of rho to the GTP-bound active form. Calpain also cleaves and activates raf, a component of the ras signaling pathway. The interaction of cells with the ECM also activates the calcium-dependent protease calpain. The interaction of cells with the ECM results in the release of calcium from intracellular stores. The release of calcium activates calpain, which cleaves cytoskeletal and signaling proteins to regulate cell migration.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The innate immune system is comprised of several cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells. Macrophages and neutrophils respond to microbial infection by producing inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. Macrophages and neutrophils also phagocytose and kill invading microbes. Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that provide a first line of defense against viral infection and cancer. NK cells are also involved in the inflammatory response. NK cells are activated by IL-2 and IL-1 2 to produce IFN-gamma, a cytokine that activates macrophages and stimulates their cytotoxic activity. NK cells also produce TNF-alpha and other cytokines that stimulate the inflammatory response. The innate immune response is initiated by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PAMPs are conserved molecular motifs unique to microorganisms. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of PRRs that recognize PAMPs. TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipoproteins, TLR4 is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and TLR9 is activated by bacterial DNA. The innate immune response is also stimulated by endogenous molecules released during tissue injury and inflammation, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs include heat shock proteins, extracellular matrix components, and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). The signaling pathways activated by PAMPs and DAMPs are similar to those activated by cytokines. Activation of TLRs leads to the recruitment of the adaptor proteins MyD8 8 and TRIF, which activate the transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1. NF-kB and AP-1 induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Activation of the interferon response by TLR9 also involves the adaptor protein MyD8 8. Secreted cytokines and chemokines activate macrophages and other immune cells to amplify the innate immune response. DAMPs also activate the endothelium to induce the expression of adhesion molecules that promote the recruitment of immune cells to the site of inflammation. The innate immune response is essential for the subsequent development of an effective adaptive immune response. The inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immune cells activate B cells and T cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies and cytotoxic T cells, respectively. The activation of the adaptive immune response is essential for the clearance of microbial infection and the prevention of autoimmune disease.",
  "The inflammatory response is a complex process involving the interaction of many different cell types. Macrophages are one of the cell types involved in the inflammatory response and are activated by a variety of signals, including bacterial products such as LPS. LPS activates macrophages through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The activation of macrophages by LPS leads to the production of cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 that stimulate the immune system and lead to the fever associated with infection. The activation of macrophages by LPS also leads to the production of nitric oxide, a reactive molecule that can be toxic to cells. The production of these inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages is regulated by the transcription factor NF-kB. In unstimulated cells NF-kB is bound to the inhibitor IkB in the cytoplasm. LPS activates the kinase NIK (NF-kB inducing kinase) that phosphorylates IkB leading to the degradation of IkB and the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus. NF-kB activates the transcription of many genes involved in the inflammatory response including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The activation of NF-kB by NIK also leads to the activation of the kinase MEKK1, which phosphorylates and activates the kinase MKK3. MKK3 in turn activates the kinase p38, also involved in the inflammatory response. The activation of p38 by NIK and MEKK1 leads to the activation of the kinase p65 and the transcription factor ATF2. ATF2 activates the transcription of the gene for interferon-beta, a cytokine that activates the immune response. The activation of NF-kB and the production of cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages are important steps in the inflammatory response. The activation of NF-kB and the production of cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages are important steps in the inflammatory response.

The activation of NF-kB and the production of cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages are also important steps in the development of atherosclerosis. The activation of NF-kB and the production of cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages are also important steps in the development of osteoporosis.",
  "The Fas receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family and transduces apoptotic signals in response to binding its ligand, Fas ligand (FasL). Fas-mediated apoptosis is important in the regulation of immune responses and may also play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and cancer. Fas-mediated apoptosis is initiated by the binding of FasL to Fas, which initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the activation of caspases and the apoptotic cell death. The Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway is complex and involves multiple proteins. The Fas receptor contains an intracellular death domain that is required for signaling. The adaptor protein FADD binds to the Fas death domain and recruits caspase-8 to the receptor complex. Caspase-8 is then activated by dimerization and autocatalysis and in turn activates downstream caspases such as caspase-3. Caspase-3 activation leads to the cleavage of cellular substrates and the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis. The Fas-FADD-caspase-8 signaling pathway is negatively regulated by the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). The expression of c-FLIP is regulated by the MAPK pathway and the level of c-FLIP determines the sensitivity of cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway is also regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are anti-apoptotic proteins that block Fas-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulate apoptosis by controlling the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Bid is a Bcl-2 family protein that is activated by Fas and induces cytochrome c release. Activated Bid interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to prevent them from blocking cytochrome c release. Cytochrome c release activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3.",
  "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide that also has a growth promoting effect on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Ang II exerts its effects through two G-protein coupled receptors, the AT and AT receptors. The AT receptor mediates the majority of the known actions of Ang II, including vasoconstriction and proliferation of VSMC. The AT receptor is a vasodilator and growth inhibitor. The AT receptor is coupled to the G-protein, Gq, which activates phospholipase C, generating the second messengers inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. These second messengers trigger the release of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C, respectively. In addition to the activation of protein kinase C, the activation of phospholipase C also stimulates the ras-dependent pathway through the activation of son-ras. The activation of ras-dependent pathway leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p3 8 MAPK. Ang II also activates other signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT pathway, the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway and the Rho-dependent pathway. These pathways may also contribute to the growth promoting effect of Ang II.",
  "Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States, with an estimated 7 5, 0 0 0 new cases diagnosed each year. The majority of bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive at presentation, but can progress to muscle-invasive disease, which is associated with a 5 0% mortality rate. The progression of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer to muscle-invasive disease is associated with the activation of the Ras pathway, and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor E2F. The activation of Ras and E2F leads to the activation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell motility, and the inactivation of genes involved in apoptosis. The activation of Ras and E2F also leads to the loss of cell-cell adhesion, which may allow for the invasion of the basement membrane and stroma.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is responsible for the recognition of specific antigen in the context of MHC-II molecules by T cells. The TCR is a multisubunit complex consisting of the clonotypic TCRalphabeta heterodimer and three invariant chains (CD3-gamma, -delta, and -epsilon). The CD3 chains are responsible for the assembly, transport, and signaling of the TCR. The TCR is associated with the tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn, which phosphorylate the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 chains, initiating a signaling cascade that leads to T cell activation. The CD4 and CD28 accessory molecules are involved in the regulation of T cell activation. The binding of the T cell receptor to MHC-II / peptide complex induces the activation of Lck, which phosphorylates Lck-Y5 0 5, leading to its inactivation and dissociation from the receptor. Lck is also involved in the activation of Fyn, which phosphorylates the CD3 chains and other substrates. The binding of Lck to CD4 or CD28 may increase Lck activity by increasing Lck concentration at the membrane, by increasing Lck phosphorylation of Lck-Y5 0 5, or by increasing Lck autophosphorylation.",
  "The nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) transcription factor regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis. In the absence of inflammatory signals, NF-kB is retained in the cytoplasm by association with the inhibitor IkBa. Activation of NF-kB occurs through the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates IkBa, targeting it for degradation by the proteasome. IkBa is a member of a family of inhibitors that includes IkBa, IkBb, and IkBg. The IKK complex is a multimeric protein kinase that includes IKKa, IKKb, and IKKg. The activation of NF-kB by inflammatory stimuli such as TNF and IL-1 is mediated through the MAP kinase pathway, which includes the kinases TAK1 and NIK, and the kinases MEKK1, MEKK3, and MEKK4. Once activated, NF-kB translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of a number of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that regulates growth and metabolism. The GH receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor gene family and signals through the JAK / STAT pathway. The JAK / STAT pathway is used by many cytokines to transmit their signals, including GH. The JAK kinases are associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the cytokine receptor and are activated by ligand binding to the receptor. The JAKs phosphorylate the receptor, creating binding sites for STAT transcription factors. The STATs are recruited to the phosphorylated receptor and are phosphorylated by the JAKs. The STATs then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. The JAKs also activate the Ras / Map kinase pathway, leading to activation of the transcription factor, AP-1.",
  "Inflammasome is a large protein complex that mediates innate immune response by activating caspase-1 and inducing the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-18. The inflammasome is formed by a sensor protein, an adaptor protein, and pro-caspase-1. The sensor protein includes NALP1, NALP3, Ipaf, and others. The sensor protein recognizes a specific molecule and triggers the assembly of the inflammasome. The assembly leads to the proximity-induced activation of caspase-1. Caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms, which are secreted out of the cell. The NALP1 inflammasome is activated by the presence of extracellular ATP and intracellular muramyl dipeptide. The NALP3 inflammasome is activated by extracellular lipopolysaccharide and intracellular uric acid.",
  "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal disorder of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells that progresses through distinct molecular and cytogenetic stages. The initial chronic phase (CP) is characterized by the presence of a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which encodes the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Progression to the accelerated phase (AP) and blast crisis (BC) is associated with additional genetic abnormalities. The most common of these are mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p15. or in b2l. The development of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has dramatically improved the treatment of CML. Imatinib is highly effective in patients with chronic-phase CML, but is less effective in patients with accelerated-phase or blast-phase CML. The development of resistance to imatinib has become a major clinical problem. Resistance can be caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain that interfere with drug binding, or by increased expression of the drug efflux protein, P-glycoprotein.",
  "The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor is a tyrosine kinase that is expressed in many cell types and is involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation. IGF-1 also stimulates proliferation of neuronal cells and protects neurons from apoptosis. In addition, IGF-1 has been shown to stimulate neurite outgrowth and regeneration. The downstream signaling pathways activated by the IGF-1 receptor are similar to those activated by the insulin receptor. The IGF-1 receptor is associated with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and activates the ras / raf / mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The src family of tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are also involved in the activation of this pathway. The calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II pathway is also involved in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by IGF-1. The calcineurin / NFAT pathway is also activated by IGF-1. The calcineurin / NFAT pathway is involved in the regulation of the immune system and is also involved in neuronal differentiation. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, which then translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. IGF-1 activates NFAT through the src family of tyrosine kinases and PI3 kinase. The calcineurin / NFAT pathway is also activated by depolarization of neurons through calcium influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. The calcineurin / NFAT pathway may play a role in the neuroprotective effects of IGF-1.",
  "The BCR gene is involved in the Philadelphia chromosome translocation, which is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The translocation fuses the BCR gene with the ABL gene, creating a fusion gene that codes for a constitutively active abl tyrosine kinase. The BCR-abl protein transforms cells by activating multiple signaling pathways, including the Ras, JAK / Stat, and PI3K pathways. The JAK / Stat pathway is activated by BCR-abl through phosphorylation of the JAK kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the Stat transcription factors. The PI3K pathway is also activated by BCR-abl, through phosphorylation of the adaptor protein GAB1. The activation of these pathways contributes to the transforming activity of BCR-abl. The Myc and Fos transcription factors are also activated by BCR-abl, contributing to the transforming activity of the fusion protein.",
  "The immune system is comprised of many different cell types that communicate with each other through cell-cell signaling molecules called cytokines. One of the ways in which the immune system responds to infection is by activating macrophages and other cells to kill the infecting pathogen. The macrophage is activated by cytokines produced by the T helper cells that it interacts with. One of the cytokines that activates macrophages is IL-12. IL-12 is produced by T helper cells that have been activated by an antigen-presenting cell (APC). IL-12 activates macrophages by inducing them to express the cell-surface protein Fas (also called Apo1). Fas is a protein on the surface of the macrophage that induces the macrophage to kill other cells when it binds to Fas ligand on another cell. The interaction of Fas and Fas ligand induces apoptosis in the Fas-positive cell. The interaction of IL-12 with its receptor on the macrophage also activates the macrophage. The IL-12 receptor is a heterodimer of two proteins, IL-12Ralpha and CD28. The CD28 protein is a co-activator of the IL-12 receptor. The interaction of an APC with a T cell activates the T cell to produce IL-12. IL-12 activates the macrophage by inducing the expression of Fas on the macrophage. IL-12 also activates T cells by inducing the expression of the IL-2receptor. The T cell that produces IL-12 also produces IL-2. IL-2 activates T cells by inducing the expression of the IL-2receptor. The interaction of an APC with a T cell activates the T cell to produce IL-12. The T cell that produces IL-12 also produces IL-2. IL-12 and IL-2 activate macrophages by inducing the expression of Fas on the macrophage. The activation of macrophages by IL-12 and IL-2 is an example of a positive feedback loop in which the macrophage activates the T cell that produces IL-12, and the T cell that produces IL-12 activates the macrophage. The activation of macrophages by IL-12 and IL-2 is part of a feedback loop that maintains the immune response.",
  "Skeletal muscle differentiation is a highly coordinated process involving the withdrawal of undifferentiated myoblasts from the cell cycle and the expression of muscle-specific genes. The myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), MyoD, Myf5, myogenin and MRF4, are master regulators of myogenesis. These factors activate muscle-specific genes and repress the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle. The activity of the MRFs is regulated by a variety of signaling pathways, including the IGF-1 / PI3K / AKT pathway, which promotes differentiation. The activity of the MRFs is also regulated by the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Phosphorylation of the MRFs by the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk2 / cyclinA or by the MAP kinase pathway inhibits their activity, while the activity of HDACs is inhibited by their association with the transcriptional coactivator CBP. The balance between the activities of the MRFs and HDACs is regulated by the extracellular environment. The IGF-1 / PI3K / AKT pathway promotes differentiation by inhibiting cdk2 and inducing the expression of the MRFs. The activity of the MRFs is also regulated by the interaction with other transcription factors. The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 alpha interacts with the MRFs and promotes their activity. The interaction of PGC-1 alpha with the MRFs is inhibited by the interaction with the transcriptional corepressor HDAC5. The interaction of HDAC5 with the MRFs is inhibited by the activity of the CaMK pathway.",
  "The cell cycle is a tightly regulated sequence of events that leads to the replication of genetic material and the division of cells. The G1 to S phase transition is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. The G1 to S phase transition is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). The activity of cdks is regulated by association with cyclins and phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinases-kinases-4 and -6 (cdk4 and cdk6). The cdk-cyclin complexes phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), releasing the transcription factor E2F-1. The transcription of genes required for DNA replication and other S phase related events are activated by E2F-1. The activity of cdk4 and cdk6 is inhibited by the INK4 family of proteins (p1 6, p1 5, p1 8 and p19). The INK4 proteins are expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner, with the expression of p16 increasing as the cells progress from G1 to S phase. The activity of the p16 protein is inhibited by the binding of the INK4 proteins to D-type cyclins. The INK4 proteins are also regulated by phosphorylation by the p21-activated kinase (p21-AK). The phosphorylation of the INK4 proteins by p21-AK inhibits their inhibitory activity and allows the formation of active cdk4 and cdk6-cyclin D complexes. The activity of p21-AK is regulated by the p90RSK kinase. The activity of p90RSK is regulated by the p38 stress activated protein kinase. The activity of p38 is also regulated by the p21-activated kinase (p38-ask). The activity of the p38-ask is inhibited by the p21-activated phosphatase (p21-AP). The activity of the p21-AP is also regulated by the p21-activated kinase (p21-AK). The p21-AK is also regulated by the p90RSK kinase. The activity of the p21-AP is inhibited by the p21-activated phosphatase (p21-AP). The activity of the p21-AP is also inhibited by the p21-activated kinase (p21-AK). The activity of the p21-AK is inhibited by the p21-activated phosphatase (p21-AP). The activity of the p21-AP is also inhibited by the p21-activated kinase (p21-AK). The activity of the p21-AK is also inhibited by the p21-activated phosphatase (p21-AP). The activity of the p21-AP is also inhibited by the p21-activated phosphatase (p21-AP).",
  "Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue by translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. This process is initiated by binding of insulin to its receptor, which activates the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. The activated receptor phosphorylates IRS-1 and IRS-2, which bind to the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase activation leads to the activation of the protein kinase AKT and the small G protein RAC. Both AKT and RAC stimulate GLUT4 translocation. The transcription factor ELK-1 is also activated by AKT, and activates the GLUT4 promoter. The transcription factor AP-1 is also activated by insulin, and may contribute to GLUT4 gene transcription. The transcription factor SRF is also activated by insulin, but its role in GLUT4 gene transcription is not known.",
  "The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by the binding of death receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily, including Fas, TNF-R1 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) -R1, to their respective ligands. The binding of these receptors by their respective ligands results in the recruitment of the adaptor protein Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) and the subsequent recruitment and activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 activation results in the cleavage of downstream caspases and the execution of apoptosis. This pathway is negatively regulated by cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP).",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically programmed cell death that plays an important role in development, tissue homeostasis, and the removal of virus-infected or mutated cells. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases exist as a family of related proteases, and each member of the caspase family has a distinct role in apoptosis. Caspases-1, -4, -5, and -1 2 are involved in the initiation phase of apoptosis, and are activated by a cascade of proteolytic cleavage. Caspases-2, -3, -6, and-7 are involved in the execution phase of apoptosis, and are activated by a different proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and-9 are involved in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis, respectively. Caspase-3, -6, and-7 are the effector caspases that cleave a variety of cellular targets to cause the morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Caspases are also involved in other cellular processes such as inflammation. Caspases are activated by two main mechanisms. The first is the extrinsic pathway, in which caspases are activated by extracellular death receptors. The second is the intrinsic pathway, in which caspases are activated by mitochondria.",
  "Hypertrophy is an important compensatory response to increased hemodynamic load in the heart. It is characterized by an increase in the size of cardiac myocytes without a corresponding increase in the thickness of the ventricular walls. The increase in cell size is due to an increase in the size of each nucleus (i.e., cell hypertrophy). Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the expression of fetal genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The increase in the expression of these genes is regulated at the transcriptional level. Cardiac hypertrophy can be pathological, such as in response to hypertension or myocardial infarction, or physiological, such as in response to exercise. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a significant risk factor for heart failure. The transition from adaptive cardiac hypertrophy to pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure is associated with a decrease in the expression of the anti-hypertrophic genes and an increase in the expression of the fetal genes. The transition from adaptive cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure is associated with a loss of myocytes. The precise molecular mechanisms that lead to cardiac hypertrophy are not well understood. It is believed that neurohumoral factors, such as angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and norepinephrine (NE), play an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Ang II activates multiple signaling pathways, including the protein kinase C (PKC) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The PKC pathway is involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis. The MAPK pathway is involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis. The activation of PKC and the MAPK pathway are also involved in the regulation of ion channels and calcium handling. ET-1 activates PKC and the MAPK pathway. NE activates PKC and the MAPK pathway. These signaling pathways ultimately lead to an increase in the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and cardiac hypertrophy.",
  "The cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is a major signaling pathway in eukaryotes. The second messenger cAMP activates PKA by binding to the regulatory subunits of PKA, releasing the catalytic subunits that phosphorylate downstream targets. The PKA pathway is involved in a variety of cellular processes including metabolism, cell growth, and differentiation. The PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-R) is a substrate for the cAMP-regulated, cAMP-dependent protein methyltransferase (D1A) that specifically catalyzes the methylation of PKA-R at a conserved arginine residue. This methylation event does not appear to affect PKA activity, but may play a role in the subcellular localization of PKA.",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a highly conserved mechanism for the recognition and removal of bulky DNA lesions caused by environmental carcinogens, chemotherapeutic agents and UV light. In humans, the NER pathway is comprised of at least three distinct pathways: global genome repair (GGR) that repairs lesions throughout the genome, transcription-coupled repair (TCR) that repairs lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes, and an additional pathway, transcription-independent repair (NIR). In GGR, XPC-hHR2 3B-CET132 is the damage recognition factor, and XPB and XPD helicases in TFIIH are required for the opening of the DNA duplex around the lesion. XPA and RPA are required for the subsequent assembly of the other factors, including the endonucleases XPG and XPF-ERCC1. In TCR, RNA polymerase II is stalled at the lesion, and the CSA and CSB proteins are required for the recruitment of the TFIIH complex. The subsequent steps of TCR are similar to those of GGR.",
  "The development of the pancreas is a complex process that requires the coordinated expression of a number of transcription factors. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors Pdx-1, NeuroD and Neurogenin 3 are involved in the differentiation of the endocrine cells of the pancreas. The paired box transcription factors Ptf1a and Ptf1b are involved in the differentiation of the exocrine and endocrine cells of the pancreas. The Fox transcription factors Foxa1 and Foxa2 are involved in the development of the exocrine pancreas. The homeodomain transcription factors PDX-1, IDX-1 and HNF6 are involved in the differentiation of the islet cells. The paired box transcription factors Pax4 and Pax6 are involved in the development of the endocrine pancreas.",
  "The Krebs cycle is a central metabolic pathway that oxidizes carbohydrates, fats and certain amino acids to produce NADH and FADH2 that are used to produce energy in the form of ATP. The cycle begins with the oxidation of acetyl-CoA to produce NADH, which is oxidized by complex I of the electron transport chain to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix. The protons are used to create an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is used to produce ATP by complex V. The electrons from NADH are transferred to complex III and complex IV, which reduce molecular oxygen to water. The electrons from FADH2 are transferred to complex II, which transfers them to ubiquinone, a mobile electron carrier that passes the electrons to complex III and complex IV. The electrons from complexes I, III and IV are transferred to oxygen to produce water. The transfer of electrons through the electron transport chain creates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is used to produce ATP by complex V. The Krebs cycle also produces intermediates that are important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, fatty acids and other essential molecules. The cycle is completed by the complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide. The cycle intermediates are transported between the complexes and are used as precursors in the biosynthesis of amino acids, fatty acids and other molecules. The enzymes that catalyze the reactions of the Krebs cycle are found in the mitochondrial matrix and are encoded by nuclear genes. The transfer of electrons through the cycle requires a high-energy electron carrier, a flavine called coenzyme Q. The oxidation of acetyl-CoA to CO2 is coupled to the reduction of coenzyme Q to QH2. The transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q is coupled to the transfer of four protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The oxidation of succinate to fumarate is coupled to the reduction of coenzyme Q to QH2. The transfer of electrons from FADH2 to coenzyme Q is coupled to the pumping of two more protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The oxidation of aceto-CoA to acetyl-CoA is coupled to the reduction of NAD + to NADH. The transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q is coupled to the transfer of four protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from FADH2 to coenzyme Q is coupled to the transfer of four protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA is coupled to the transfer of four protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from 2-oxoglutarate to fumarate is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from isocitrate to isocitrate is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from 2-oxoglutarate to fumarate is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from malate to pyruvate is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from pyruvate to NAD + is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from glucose to pyruvate is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The transfer of electrons from pyruvate to lactate is coupled to the transfer of two protons from the intermembrane space to the matrix.",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine that stimulates red blood cell production. Epo production is stimulated by hypoxia and inhibited by anemia. Epo acts on red blood cell precursors to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation. Epo also has neuroprotective effects. Epo is produced primarily in the kidneys, but can also be produced in the brain and other tissues in response to hypoxia. Epo production is stimulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. HIF-1 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors that also includes HIF-2 and HLF. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of HIF-1alpha and ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator). ARNT is also a member of the bHLH family. HIF-1 binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the Epo and other genes that are activated by hypoxia. HIF-1 is a target of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), which targets HIF-1 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation under normoxic conditions. Inactivation of pVHL leads to constitutive expression of HIF-1 and increased production of Epo and other hypoxia-inducible genes. HIF-1 activity is also stimulated by hypoxia through an oxygen-dependent mechanism that does not involve pVHL. HIF-1 stimulates red blood cell production by activating the expression of genes that stimulate red blood cell production, including the Epo receptor, and genes that increase red blood cell survival, such as the Bcl-xL gene. HIF-1 also stimulates angiogenesis by activating the expression of genes that stimulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and other cells. The neuroprotective effects of Epo may be mediated by a similar mechanism.",
  "The beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by the endogenous agonist norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine. The betaAR is expressed in a variety of tissues and is involved in many physiological processes. The betaAR is phosphorylated by GRKs upon agonist binding, which recruits arrestin to the receptor, sterically preventing further G protein coupling. The betaAR-arrestin complex also acts as an adaptor to internalize the receptor into clathrin-coated pits. The betaAR is also rapidly phosphorylated by GRKs and other kinases upon agonist occupancy, and this phosphorylation creates binding sites for arrestin. Once bound, arrestin sterically inhibits further G protein coupling. The betaAR is also rapidly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases. The receptor is then either dephosphorylated and recycled to the cell surface, or it is targeted for degradation. The betaAR is a key regulator of heart rate and is the drug target of beta-blockers used to treat hypertension and heart failure. The betaAR is also coupled to the Gs-protein, stimulating the production of cAMP. The betaAR is also coupled to the Gi-protein, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and cAMP production. The betaAR is the most highly phosphorylated GPCR, with over 3 0 sites of phosphorylation. The GRK family of kinases specifically phosphorylates the agonist occupied receptor. The GRKs phosphorylate serine and threonine residues within the receptor's C-terminal tail, and the GRK family is comprised of GRK1, GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, and GRK6. GRK3 is restricted in its expression to the retina, while the other GRKs are more widely expressed. The GRKs are classified based on their sequence homology and their preferred receptor substrate. GRK1 and GRK4 are closely related, and are referred to as GRK1-like. GRK2 and GRK3 are grouped together as the GRK2-like family, and GRK4 and GRK5 are grouped together as the GRK4-like family. The GRKs are involved in homologous desensitization of the betaAR, and are also involved in heterologous desensitization of other GPCRs. The arrestins bind to the phosphorylated betaAR-arrestin complex, sterically inhibiting further G protein coupling. The betaAR-arrestin complex also acts as an adaptor to recruit clathrin and other components of clathrin-coated pits to the membrane, bringing the receptor into clathrin-coated vesicles. The receptor is then internalized into the clathrin-coated vesicles, and is either recycled to the cell surface, or is targeted for degradation. The GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the betaAR is involved in homologous desensitization, but also appears to be involved in heterologous desensitization of other GPCRs. The betaAR is also involved in the activation of the MAPK cascade, a pathway involved in cellular proliferation and survival. The MAPK cascade is activated by the betaAR through a pathway involving Gs, AC, and EPAC. The betaAR also activates the PI3K pathway, which may also be involved in cellular proliferation and survival. The PI3K pathway is also activated by the betaAR through a pathway involving Gi, but does not appear to be involved in MAPK activation.",
  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a serine / threonine kinase that is activated by the second messenger cAMP. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. The regulatory subunit binds cAMP, which causes the subunits to dissociate and release active catalytic subunits. The PKA holoenzyme is involved in a variety of cellular processes including growth and differentiation. The PKA regulatory subunit is encoded by four genes, Prkar1a, Prkar1b, Prkar2a and Prkar2b. The PKA catalytic subunit is encoded by three genes, Prkaca, Prkacb and Prkacg. The PKA regulatory subunits are classified as either type I or type II depending on their binding affinity for cAMP. The type I regulatory subunit binds cAMP with high affinity and is encoded by Prkar1a and Prkar1b. The type II regulatory subunit binds cAMP with low affinity and is encoded by Prkar2a and Prkar2b. The catalytic subunits are encoded by Prkaca and Prkacb. PKA is involved in a variety of cellular processes including growth and differentiation. PKA is involved in the regulation of cell growth through the MAPK pathway. PKA can inhibit the MAPK pathway through the phosphorylation of the p276 subunit of the ras gene. PKA can also activate the MAPK pathway through the phosphorylation of raf. PKA can also activate the MAPK pathway through the phosphorylation of the p38 subunit of the ras gene. PKA can also activate the MAPK pathway through the phosphorylation of the p38 subunit of the ras gene. PKA can also activate the MAPK pathway through the phosphorylation of the raf gene.

PKA can activate the MAPK pathway through the phosphorylation of the raf gene.",
  "The olfactory system is a unique sensory system that detects a wide variety of odorants. The olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the nasal cavity detect odorants and transmit the signal to the olfactory bulb (OB). Each ORN expresses a single type of olfactory receptor (OR) gene and expresses it monohanously. Each ORN expresses only one OR gene from a large repertoire of genes. The OR proteins are localized to the cilia of ORNs and form a ligand-gated ion channel. The OR proteins are modified by N-linked glycosylation and are targeted to cilia by the action of a chaperone protein, odaculin. The activation of the OR leads to the activation of a cyclic-nucleotide gated (CNG) channel and a subsequent influx of cations, depolarization of the ORN. The depolarization of the ORN activates voltage-gated sodium channels, which in turn activate voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of calcium activates calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), which in turn activates a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B). The phosphorylation of MAP1B by CaMKII leads to the release of the ORN cilia from the basal bodies. The ORNs then reenter the cell cycle and undergo mitosis.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors that promote survival and growth of neurons. NGF binds to TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, and to the p7 5NTR receptor, a member of the TNF receptor gene family. TrkA is coupled to the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway through the adaptor protein Shc and the adaptor protein Grb2. The activation of PI-3K leads to the phosphorylation of AKT and the phosphorylation of BAD, releasing it from the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. The activation of the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway leads to the phosphorylation of CREB and the induction of genes involved in cell survival and growth. The activation of the JNK pathway leads to the phosphorylation of c-jun and the activation of genes involved in cell survival and growth. The activation of the p38 pathway leads to the activation of the Map kinases and the induction of genes involved in cell survival and growth. The activation of the JNK pathway leads to the activation of c-jun and the induction of genes involved in cell survival and growth. The activation of the p38 pathway leads to the activation of Map kinases and the induction of genes involved in cell survival and growth.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) is a protein kinase that is activated by binding to its regulatory subunit p3 5. The cdk5 / p3 5 complex hyperphosphorylates the microtubule associated protein tau, leading to the formation of paired helical filaments (PHFs) that constitute the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cleavage of p3 5 to p2 5 by the protease calpain produces a more stable and active cdk5 / p2 5 complex. The activation of cdk5 by calpain may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. The cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by calpain may also contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques in AD. The activity of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that dephosphorylates tau is also reduced in AD. The activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3-beta), another kinase involved in the hyperphosphorylation of tau, is also regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The activity of the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates GSK-3-beta, is reduced in AD.",
  "The complement system is a group of proteins that are involved in the immune response. The complement system is activated by the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. The classical pathway is activated by the presence of antigen-antibody complexes on the surface of cells. The alternative pathway is activated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrate patterns on the cell surface by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or collectins. The complement system is activated by three different proteases, C1r, C1s, and MASP. The first step of the complement cascade is the activation of the classical pathway by the C1 complex, which is formed by the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by C1q. The C1 complex is formed by three proteins, C1q, C1r, and C1s. The recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by C1q initiates a proteolytic cascade that leads to the cleavage of C3 by C1s, generating the C3 convertase. The C3 convertase cleaves the complement protein C3 and generates C3a and C3b. C3a is a small peptide that is released from the C3 protein and is a chemoattractant. C3b is the central component of the C3 convertase and is covalently attached to the surface of the activating cell. The cleavage of C3 by the C3 convertase creates a new C3 convertase that cleaves additional C3 molecules, generating more C3b. The cleavage of C3 by the C3 convertase creates a new C3a peptide and a new C3b that is covalently attached to the activating surface. The attachment of C3b to the activating surface creates a reactive site that can be recognized by factor B (B). Factor B is a protein that is present in plasma in a complex with factor D. The complex of B and factor D cleaves C3 to create new C3a and C3b. The new C3b interacts with the C3 convertase to form the C5 convertase. The cleavage of C5 by the C5 convertase creates the C5 convertase. The cleavage of C5 by the C5 convertase creates the terminal complement protein C5b. The addition of C6, C7, and C8 creates the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC forms a pore in the cell membrane that allows ions to flow freely between the cell interior and the exterior. The formation of MAC causes cell lysis.",
  "The heat shock protein 9 0 (Hsp9 0) is a molecular chaperone that is involved in the maturation of a number of proteins, including steroid hormone receptors. The p53 protein is a transcription factor that is stabilized by Hsp9 0 and is activated by stress. The activation of p53 by stress is blocked by the benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin, which binds to the ATP binding site of Hsp9 0 and inhibits its chaperone activity. Geldanamycin also binds to p53 and inhibits its activation by stress. The activation of p53 by stress is blocked by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, suggesting that a kinase is involved in the stress activation of p53. The stress activation of p53 is also blocked by the serine / threonine kinase inhibitor H7, suggesting that a kinase is involved in the stress activation of p53. The kinase that is involved in the stress activation of p53 is not known. The activation of p53 by stress is blocked by the addition of glutathione, suggesting that oxidation of cellular components may be involved in the activation of p53 by stress. The activation of p53 by stress may be involved in the activation of genes by stress, such as the induction of apoptosis. The inhibition of the activation of p53 by geldanamycin by glutathione suggests that the activation of p53 by stress may be involved in the anti-tumor activity of geldanamycin.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen for many cell types and is an important mediator of growth and development. IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a tyrosine kinase receptor, activating a signaling cascade that includes the Shc, Grb2, Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK kinases. This pathway is similar to that used by the EGF receptor to activate the ERK pathway. The importance of this pathway is demonstrated by the phenotype of mice lacking the IGF-1R. Mice lacking the IGF-1R are small and have reduced numbers of cells in many tissues. The IGF-1R is also important in transformation by several viruses and by some oncogenes. The IGF-1R is also a target of inhibition by some cancer drugs.",
  "The immune system is comprised of a variety of cells and proteins that work together to protect the body from infection and disease. One of the key components of the immune system is the T cell. T cells help other cells to respond to infection and also help the body's own cells to remove cells that have been infected by disease-causing agents. T cells are classified into two types, helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells help other cells to respond to infection and also help the body's own cells to remove cells that have been infected by disease-causing agents. Cytotoxic T cells respond to infection by killing cells that have been infected. Helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells respond to infection by activating other immune cells and cells in the body. T cells respond to infection by activating when they recognize specific antigens on the surface of other cells. T cells are activated by two different types of signals. The first type of signal is called the antigen-specific signal. Each T cell only responds to a specific antigen presented by another cell. The second type of signal is called the costimulatory signal. T cells that do not receive the antigen-specific signal may respond to the costimulatory signal. The costimulatory signal is provided by a group of proteins called the costimulatory molecules. The costimulatory molecules include the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 and the chemokines CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL9. The costimulatory molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The costimulatory signal is required for T cells to respond to antigen and activate other immune cells. Blocking the costimulatory signal can prevent an immune response and cause disease.",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to a severe decline in cognitive functions. The two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Senile plaques are composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs) that are mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that Abeta plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta can induce neuronal death through a variety of mechanisms, including the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the disruption of calcium homeostasis, and the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP). The disruption of calcium homeostasis can lead to abnormal phosphorylation of tau, which contributes to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The inhibition of LTP may lead to synaptic dysfunction and eventually cell death.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland in response to stimulation by various factors, including exercise, stress, and metabolic needs. The actions of GH are mediated by the GH receptor (GHR), which is found in many tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Binding of GH to the GHR activates the JAK / STAT signaling pathway and the MAPK pathway. These pathways result in gene transcription and other responses that lead to increased cell proliferation and metabolism.",
  "Trefoil factors are a family of small secreted peptides expressed in the gastrointestinal tract with a key role in mucosal protection and repair. Trefoil factors are up-regulated in conditions associated with mucosal injury, such as in response to irritants, and are also expressed in a number of cancers. The three mammalian trefoil factors, pS2, spasmolytic peptide (SP) and intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), are expressed in a coordinated fashion in the gastrointestinal tract. Trefoil factor expression is regulated by a number of factors including growth factors, cytokines and hormones. Trefoil factors are not secreted but are retained in the vicinity of the secreting cell by virtue of association with mucins. Trefoil factors are also involved in cell migration and protection. Trefoil factor expression is regulated by a number of signaling pathways including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the p38 MAP kinase pathway, and the p13 0 chakostate-dependent pathway. Trefoil factors stimulate cell migration and proliferation in a number of different cell types. The trefoil factors are likely to act in concert with other factors to provide a coordinated response to mucosal damage.",
  "The Fas / FasL system is a major pathway of apoptosis in many cell types. Binding of Fas ligand to Fas activates a caspase cascade, resulting in cleavage of cellular proteins and cell death. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that includes interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), which is a key protease in the apoptotic pathway. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of caspases occurs in a cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating each other, and then further cleaving and activating other caspases. Caspases cleave a variety of cellular proteins, including the nuclear enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is involved in DNA repair. Caspase activation also results in the degradation of other cellular proteins, including lamins, which are structural components of the nucleus. Caspase activation also leads to the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, where it induces apoptosis. The activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) also contributes to apoptosis.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of enzymatic reactions leading to the conversion of soluble prothrombin to the insoluble fibrin clot. The clotting cascade is initiated by the extrinsic pathway through the interaction of tissue factor (TF) with factors VII, IX, and X in the presence of calcium ions. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by the interaction of activated factor XII (FXIIa) with negatively charged surfaces. The activation of prothrombin is catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex, a membrane-bound complex of factor Xa (FXa), factor Va (FVa), and calcium ions. The clot is stabilized by thrombin, which is generated by the two-stage proteolytic activation of prothrombin by TF-factor VIIa (TF-FVIIa) and factor XIa (FXIa). The activated platelets release ADP and fibrinogen, which bind to each other to form a clot network.",
  "The second messenger cAMP is a key regulator of cellular function. It is formed from ATP by the enzyme adenylate cyclase in response to a variety of extracellular signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters and autocoids. The actions of cAMP are mediated by three types of intracellular receptors, the protein kinase A (PKA), Epac and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. The PKA is a tetramer of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits results in their dissociation and the activation of the catalytic subunits. The PKA phosphorylates a variety of substrates to regulate cellular function. The Epac proteins are a family of cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the small G-protein Rap. The Epac proteins are structurally related to the cAMP-regulated Epac-like proteins, but are not regulated by cAMP. The Epac proteins are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell-cell junctions and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The cAMP-dependent activation of Epac can also activate the MAPK pathway. The cAMP-dependent activation of Epac can also activate the phospholipase C-epsilon pathway. The phospholipase C-epsilon pathway is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and cell motility.",
  "Insulin binding to its receptor activates the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, which phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. This leads to the recruitment and activation of the class IA PI3Ks, which phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and the serine / threonine kinase AKT. AKT phosphorylates and activates the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which in turn leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the 4EBP1 and 4EBP2 proteins and the release of the inhibition of the eIF4E factor by the 4EBP proteins. This allows eIF4E to interact with eIF4G and other factors to form the active eIF4F complex, which stimulates the translation of mRNAs with a 5 '-7methyl-guanosine cap. AKT also phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor FoxO, which induces the expression of genes involved in metabolism, cell survival and cell cycle progression. The serine / threonine kinase mTOR also is activated by amino acids, which activate the Rag GTPases and the MAP4K3 / 6 pathway. The association of Rheb with mTOR is inhibited by the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which is also regulated by AKT.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation. Overexpression of the EGFR has been implicated in the development of a variety of human cancers. The EGFR is activated by binding of EGF or TGF-alpha, and initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of Ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The EGFR also activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway, which leads to the activation of Akt and other downstream signaling pathways. The CrkL adaptor protein is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and is phosphorylated and activated by the EGFR. CrkL is involved in the activation of Rac, a small G protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac by the EGFR requires the CrkL-DOCK1 8 0 complex, a complex that activates Rac. The CrkL-DOCK1 8 0 complex is also involved in the activation of Ras by the EGFR. The activation of Rac and Ras by the EGFR may contribute to the regulation of cellular proliferation and migration.",
  "The Krebs cycle is a central metabolic pathway that produces NADH and FADH2 for use in the electron transport chain and in the biosynthesis of many important molecules such as amino acids and fatty acids. The cycle begins with the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. The next step is the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl-CoA to form citrate. Citrate is then cleaved to yield two molecules of acetyl-CoA, which enter the cycle again. The cycle continues with a series of reactions that yield NADH and FADH2. The NADH and FADH2 are used to drive the electron transport chain.",
  "Protein ubiquitination is a key regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes that controls protein stability and activity. It is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, gene transcription, DNA repair, virus infection, stress response, etc.. Protein ubiquitination is a three-step reaction involving three enzymes, E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). The E3 determines the substrate specificity of ubiquitination. There are two major types of E3: HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) and U-box (ubiquitin-protein ligases). HECT E3s form a covalent bond with ubiquitin before transferring it to the substrate. U-box E3s do not form a covalent intermediate with ubiquitin. There are two major classes of E3s: single-subunit E3s and multi-subunit E3s. Single-subunit E3s include SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein), APC (anaphase-promoting complex), and VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor). Multi-subunit E3s include: Cbl (Casitas b-lineage lymphoma), UBR (ubiquitin protein ligases), and Nedd4 (neuronal precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4).",
  "Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a linear polysaccharide consisting of disaccharide units of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA). The disaccharide units are joined together by beta1-3 glycosidic bonds to form a polymer. The polymerization is completed by the addition of sulfate ester groups at various positions along the polysaccharide chain. The biosynthesis of CS involves the coordinated action of several different enzymes. The first enzyme in the pathway is UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: polysaccharide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGalNAcT), which initiates the polymerization of CS by transferring N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to a linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl). Chondroitin synthase (ChSase) then catalyzes the polymerization of the polymer by the addition of glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues. The polymerization is completed by the addition of alternating galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues catalyzed by the epimerase CS-E (ChSase-E). The sulfation of the polymer occurs in a stepwise fashion, with sulfation at the C-4 position of the GalNAc residues first followed by the C-2 position of the GalNAc residues and then the C-6 position of the GalNAc residues. The sulfation of the GalNAc residues is catalyzed by a family of sulfotransferases. The first enzyme in the pathway is UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: polysaccharide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGalNAc-T). This enzyme adds the first N-acetylgalactosamine residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The next three enzymes in the pathway are UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: polysaccharide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (pGlcNAc-T). These enzymes catalyze the addition of N-acetylglucosamine residues to the tetrasaccharide to form the disaccharide, disaccharide, and trisaccharide. The tetrasaccharide is then sulfated by the action of the chondroitin sulfotransferase (ChST) family of enzymes. The tetrasaccharide is sulfated at the C-4 position of the first N-acetylgalactosamine residue and the C-6 position of the second N-acetylgalactosamine residue. The tetrasaccharide is not sulfated at the C-2 position of the third N-acetylgalactosamine residue. The final enzyme in the pathway is the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pGalNAc-T) that adds N-acetylgalactosamine residues to the tetrasaccharide to form the pentasaccharide. The final enzyme in the pathway is the glucuronosyltransferase (GlcA-T) that adds glucuronic acid residues to the tetrasaccharide to form the pentasaccharide. The final enzyme in the pathway is the N-acetylchondroitinase (NCA) that cleaves the N-acetylgalactosamine residues to form disaccharides and trisaccharides.",
  "The central nervous system (CNS) is an immune privileged site. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), restricts the entry of most molecules and cells into the brain from the blood. The tight junctions between the endothelial cells create a paracellular diffusion barrier, preventing the free diffusion of water, ions, and small molecules. The lack of pinocytosis and the presence of tight junctions limit the transport of macromolecules. The expression of adhesion molecules and co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of BMECs regulate the entry of T cells into the CNS. The expression of adhesion molecules and co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of BMECs regulate the entry of T cells into the CNS. The expression of adhesion molecules and co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of BMECs regulates the entry of T cells into the CNS.",
  "Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors activated by proteolytic cleavage of a peptide from the N-terminus. The PAR family includes PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3 and PAR-4. PAR-1 is activated by thrombin, PAR-2 by trypsin, PAR-3 by the trypsin-like protease coagulation factor-II thrombin receptor (F2R), and PAR-4 by trypsin and the coagulation factors VIIa and Xa. PARs are widely expressed in the body and are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. PARs are activated by tethered ligand peptides generated by proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminus. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand can activate PARs in the absence of cleavage. Proteolysis unmasks a tethered ligand that binds to the body of the receptor to activate G-protein signaling. PAR-1 and PAR-4 are cleaved by thrombin, PAR-2 by trypsin, and PAR-3 is not cleaved by either thrombin or trypsin. PAR-1 and PAR-4 are cleaved and activated by low nanomolar concentrations of thrombin, while PAR-2 is activated by high nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of trypsin. PAR-1 and PAR-4 are cleaved and activated by the same tethered ligand sequence, SFLLRN, and PAR-2 is cleaved and activated by a different tethered ligand sequence, SFLLRNP. PAR-1 and PAR-3 are cleaved and activated by the same protease, trypsin. PAR-1 and PAR-2 are cleaved and activated by a different tethered ligand sequence, SKGR. PAR-1 and PAR-2 are cleaved and activated by the same tethered ligand sequence, SFLLRN. PAR-3 is cleaved and activated by the same tethered ligand sequence, GYPGQV. PAR-1 and PAR-2 are coupled to Gq, Gi and G1 2 / 1 3. PAR-3 is coupled to Gi. PAR-2 also signals through beta-arrestin-mediated activation of beta-arrestin signaling. PAR-1 and PAR-2 activation by thrombin results in cellular responses such as platelet activation, endothelial barrier disruption, and inflammatory signaling. PAR-1 activation by thrombin also plays a role in the clotting of blood. PAR-2 activation by trypsin plays a role in the digestion of dietary proteins.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of proteolytic reactions that lead to the formation of a clot. The coagulation cascade begins with the activation of prothrombin by the complex of factor Xa and factor Va. The prothrombin activation complex also includes factors V and XII. Activated factor XII (factor XIIa) cleaves and activates factor XI. Activated factor XI and factor XII form a proteolytic feedback loop that greatly accelerates the activation of prothrombin. Tissue factor (TF) is the cellular receptor for factor VII / VIIa. Tissue factor is expressed by vascular endothelial cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. Tissue factor is the most important activator of the coagulation cascade in vivo. The activation of prothrombin by the factor Xa-factor Va complex is inhibited by antithrombin III (ATIII) and protein C (protein C). Protein C is activated by thrombin (activated protein C). Activated protein C (APC) in the presence of protein S (S) inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. The inhibition of the factors Va and VIIIa by APC and protein S prevents the formation of thrombin and the further activation of prothrombin.",
  "Acetylcholine (Ach) is a neurotransmitter that is released from motor neurons and stimulates smooth muscle relaxation and glandular secretion. Ach is also released from sensory neurons and stimulates smooth muscle contraction. The primary receptor for Ach is the muscarinic receptor family. There are five subtypes of muscarinic receptor (M1-M5) that are coupled to different second messenger pathways. The M1, M3 and M5 subtypes are Gq-coupled receptors that stimulate phospholipase C, resulting in the release of IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 stimulates the release of intracellular calcium, which activates various signaling pathways. DAG activates protein kinase C, and both IP3 and DAG activate the MAP kinase pathway. The M2 and M4 subtypes are Gi-coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and the production of cAMP. The M2 and M4 receptors also activate potassium channels and inhibit calcium channels. The M1, M3 and M5 subtypes are coupled to the Gq family of G proteins and stimulate phospholipase C. The M1 and M3 receptors also activate the MAP kinase pathway. The M2 and M4 receptors also activate potassium channels and inhibit calcium channels. The M2 and M4 receptors also inhibit adenylyl cyclase. The M2 and M4 receptors also activate phospholipase D via a pathway that is independent of both PKC and the small G protein Rho. The M1 and M3 receptors also activate phospholipase A2 via a pathway that is independent of both Rho and PKC. The M2 and M4 receptors also activate phospholipase D via a pathway that is independent of both Rho and PKC. The activation of phospholipase A2 and D by the muscarinic receptors results in the release of arachidonic acid and the subsequent production of lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The release of arachidonic acid by the muscarinic receptors has been shown to be important for the regulation of smooth muscle tone. The production of these lipid mediators by the muscarinic receptors may also play a role in other physiological processes such as the regulation of inflammation.",
  "Leukocyte adhesion is a fundamental process in inflammation and immune surveillance. The initial step of leukocyte recruitment is the firm adhesion of circulating leukocytes to the endothelium under the shear flow of blood. This process is mediated by a family of adhesion molecules, the integrins and the selectins. The leukocyte integrins LFA-1 (CD11a / CD1 8), Mac-1 (CD11b / CD1 8), and p11 (CD11c / CD1 8) mediate firm adhesion through their interaction with counter-receptors ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), ICAM-2, and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). P-, E-, and L-selectins mediate rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium by binding to their ligands, i.e., PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1), E-selectin, and L-selectin, respectively. After firm adhesion, leukocytes are activated and then crawled on the endothelium to extravasate into tissues. Leukocyte migration is a highly coordinated process that is regulated by a variety of signaling pathways.",
  "The immune system is comprised of two major components, the immune cells, and the proteins that respond to the immune cells. The immune cells include T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The immune response is triggered by the interaction of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with T cells. The APCs are found in the body in two forms, macrophages and dendritic cells. Macrophages are found in most tissues and are responsible for the phagocytosis of bacteria and other cells. Dendritic cells are found in the lymphoid tissues and are responsible for the presentation of antigen to T cells. The interaction of antigen-presenting cells with T cells leads to the activation of the T cell. T cells are classified as helper T cells (Th) that respond to other T cells in the immune response, or cytotoxic T cells (Tc) that respond to a specific antigen. The helper T cells produce cytokines that stimulate the response of other immune cells, while the cytotoxic T cells are responsible for killing infected cells. The interaction of antigen-presenting cells with B cells leads to the production of antibodies that bind and inactivate the antigen. The interaction of antigen-presenting cells with T cells and B cells leads to the expression of a variety of genes in the antigen-presenting cell. The expression of these genes leads to the expression of proteins that stimulate the immune response. The interaction of antigen-presenting cells with T cells and B cells leads to the expression of a variety of genes in the antigen-presenting cell that are involved in the activation of the T cell and B cell. One of the genes expressed by antigen-presenting cells is the CD40 ligand. The interaction of CD40 with CD40 ligand on T cells leads to the activation of the T cell. The CD40 ligand is also involved in the interaction of B cells with T cells. The interaction of CD40 with CD40 ligand on T cells and B cells stimulates the proliferation of these cells.",
  "Translation is the process by which a cell translates its mRNA into protein. The initiation of translation is the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis and is regulated by a variety of factors. Translation is divided into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Translation initiation begins with the binding of the Met-tRNAi to the 4 0S ribosomal subunit. This complex then binds to the mRNA and a ternary complex of eIF2, GTP, and Met-tRNAi is formed. This complex is delivered to the 6 0S subunit, where it is joined by the 6 0S subunit with the factors to form the 8 0S initiation complex. Translation elongation begins with the binding of GTP to eEF1A, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1. This complex then binds to the aminoacyl-tRNA to form the ternary complex. The ternary complex moves along the mRNA until it reaches the stop codon, where the complex is dissociated and the factors released.",
  "WASP is a cytoplasmic protein that is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. WASP is a key component of the signal transduction pathway that regulates the formation of actin-based cellular structures in response to extracellular signals. The WASP gene was first identified as the defective gene in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X-linked disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and severe infections. The WASP protein is a key component of a signal transduction pathway that regulates actin polymerization and the formation of cellular structures such as filopodia and lamellipodia. The WASP protein is a member of a family of proteins that share a conserved region of sequence homology known as the WASP-homology (WH1) domain. The WH1 domain is the site of interaction with the small GTPase Cdc4 2, which is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization by WASP. The C-terminal region of WASP contains a basic region, a polyproline region, and a VCA domain that is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization. The basic region and the polyproline region interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex, a complex of proteins that nucleates actin polymerization. The VCA domain interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex and activates the actin nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex. The activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex is regulated by the WASP-interacting protein (WIP). The interaction of WASP with Cdc4 2 and WIP relieves the auto-inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex by the basic region and the VCA domain. The interaction of WASP with actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP by the tyrosine kinase Abl. The Arp2 / 3 complex and WASP are localized at the leading edge of lamellipodia and filopodia, where they regulate actin polymerization and the formation of cellular structures such as filopodia and lamellipodia. The interaction of WASP with Cdc4 2 and WIP are important for the localization of WASP at the leading edge of the cell. The interaction of WASP with Arp2 / 3 and actin is negatively regulated by the GTPase Rac. The interaction of WASP with Cdc4 2 and WIP is important for the localization of WASP at the leading edge of the cell. The interaction of WASP with Arp2 / 3 and actin is negatively regulated by the GTPase Rac. The interaction of WASP with Cdc4 2 and WIP is important for the localization of WASP at the leading edge of the cell.

  "Hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension that is found in many diseases, including stroke, myocardial infraction, and cancer. Cells respond to hypoxia by increasing the expression of genes that increase oxygen delivery and decrease the expression of genes that consume oxygen. The transcription factors that respond to hypoxia are the HIFs. HIFs are heterodimers consisting of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit. The HIF-alpha subunits are targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway under normoxic conditions. The HIF-alpha subunits are hydroxylated on two proline residues by members of the PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain) family of proteins. The hydroxylation targets HIF-alpha for binding by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), which targets HIF-alpha for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. In addition to oxygen, HIF-alpha hydroxylation is inhibited by the presence of iron and 2-oxoglutarate. The activity of the HIF-alpha subunit is also regulated by oxygen-independent pathways. The HIF-alpha subunits are stabilized by the presence of reactive oxygen species and by the activation of the ras and src oncogenes. The activation of HIF-1 by hypoxia and other factors results in the transcriptional activation of genes involved in oxygen delivery and adaptation to hypoxia, including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and glycolytic enzymes. The activation of HIF-1 by hypoxia and other factors may play a role in the development of cancer and other diseases.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of reactions leading to the formation of a clot that stops bleeding from damaged blood vessels. The clotting cascade begins with the activation of prothrombin by the complex of tissue factor (TF) and factor VIIa (FVIIa). Once activated, factor Xa converts prothrombin to thrombin, the enzyme responsible for all of the subsequent clotting reactions. The activation of prothrombin is greatly stimulated by the presence of TF, which is present in the membrane of damaged blood vessels. The activation of factor X by factor Xa is also greatly stimulated by the presence of factor Va, which is formed by the cleavage of factor V by activated thrombin. The activation of prothrombin and factor X by the TF-FVIIa complex is inhibited by the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The inhibition of the clotting cascade by TFPI is reversed by the protein S-dependent protein C pathway. The protein C pathway is also regulated by the activated protein C-dependent inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa. The activation of protein C by thrombin is enhanced by the protein S-dependent protein C activator (activated protein C-thrombomodulin). The inhibition of the clotting cascade by heparin is due to the binding of heparin to factors IIa and Xa, blocking their interaction with thrombin.",
  "The initiation of DNA replication occurs at multiple origins along each chromosome. The activation of replication origins is a highly regulated process that is dependent on the cell cycle stage. In late mitosis and early G1 phase, the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to replication origins and recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1 to the origins. In late M phase and early G1 phase, the MCM complex (MCM2-7) is loaded onto chromatin as a double hexamer. The activation of replication origins occurs in late M phase and early G1 phase when the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is low. At the G1 / S phase transition, the activation of the S phase cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) triggers the initiation of DNA replication. The activated CDK phosphorylates multiple substrates, including the ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM complex, and dissociates them from origins. The origin is then converted into an unstable pre-RC, in which the MCM complex is encircling the DNA. The conversion of the pre-RC into the stable post-RC is inhibited by the geminin-dependent loading of the MCM complex onto chromatin by the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1. The Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (Dbf4k / cdc7) is required for the initiation of DNA replication and is required throughout the S phase. The Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) phosphorylates the MCM complex and other replication factors. The association of RPA with chromatin is dependent on the presence of the MCM complex, and RPA loading is a good indicator of the formation of the pre-RC. The activation of the replication origins is accompanied by the conversion of the pre-RC into an unstable pre-IC and the complete unwinding of the DNA. The elongation of DNA replication is dependent on PCNA and RFC.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is a multisubunit protein complex that plays a central role in the immune system by recognizing foreign antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on antigen-presenting cells. The TCR complex is associated with three types of invariant chains, CD3 gamma, delta, and epsilon, and the signal transducing subunits, TCRzeta and TCRzeta. The CD3 chains are required for efficient cell-surface expression of the TCR complex, and for its coupling to downstream signaling pathways. The TCRzeta chain contains a tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that is required for TCR signaling. The phosphorylation of the ITAMs by Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is a key step in TCR signaling. The protein tyrosine phosphatase CD4 5 is required for the activation of Src family PTKs and for the initiation of TCR signaling. The activation of Src family PTKs leads to the phosphorylation of the TCRzeta chain and the recruitment of ZAP-7 0 to the TCR complex. The binding of ZAP-7 0 to the phosphorylated TCRzeta and ZAP-7 0 to LAT (linker for activation of T cells) initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of transcription factors and other downstream effectors.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen that stimulates growth and proliferation of many cell types. The biological actions of IGF-1 are mediated by the IGF-1 receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase gene family. The IGF-1 receptor is widely expressed in many tissues and is involved in many physiological processes, including growth, development, and maintenance of the adult. The IGF-1 receptor is a heterodimer with two subunits, alpha and beta. The alpha-subunit is involved in ligand binding, and the beta-subunit is the tyrosine kinase. Binding of IGF-1 to the receptor causes autophosphorylation of the receptor and activation of the tyrosine kinase. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide binding sites for other signaling molecules containing src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The adaptor proteins Shc, IRS-1, and IRS-2 are recruited to the receptor and are phosphorylated by the IGF-1 receptor. These proteins bind to the adaptor protein Grb2, which in turn binds to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1. This complex activates the ras / raf / MEK / MAPK pathway, leading to cell proliferation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) is also activated by the IGF-1 receptor and contributes to the mitogenic response. The serine / threonine kinase Akt is also activated by the IGF-1 receptor and contributes to cell survival. Another substrate of the IGF-1 receptor is the transcription factor ELK-1, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival. The activation of ELK-1 by the IGF-1 receptor may be involved in the activation of the c-jun promoter by IGF-1.",

  "The inflammatory response is initiated by the recognition of invading pathogens by the host immune system. The recognition of pathogens by the immune system is mediated by a variety of pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are a family of receptors expressed on the cell surface of immune cells that recognize conserved structures on pathogens called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The binding of PAMPs to TLRs activates signaling pathways that induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. The inflammatory response is essential for the clearance of invading pathogens, but can also cause tissue damage if it is not properly regulated. The inflammatory response is regulated by a variety of factors, including the counter-regulatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The balance of these factors is critical for the successful resolution of an infection, and imbalances in this balance can lead to inflammatory disorders such as arthritis and septic shock. The production of inflammatory cytokines by immune cells is induced by the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kB and Stat by signaling pathways that include the Toll-like receptors and the IL-1 receptor. The counter-regulatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1RA inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, and are important in the resolution of inflammation.

The activation of NF-kB is inhibited by the transcription factor Stat-3, which is activated by IL-10 and other anti-inflammatory cytokines. The activation of NF-kB and Stat-3 are important in the induction of inflammatory genes, but are also involved in the induction of anti-inflammatory genes such as IL-1RA and IL-10. The balance of NF-kB and Stat-3 activation is critical for the successful resolution of an infection, and is mediated in large part by the regulation of NF-kB and Stat-3 activity by the transcription factor IRF-1.

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is activated by binding of its natural ligand, epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptors that also includes ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. Binding of EGF to the extracellular domain of the receptor results in receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain. Receptor activation leads to the recruitment of signaling molecules to the activated receptor, triggering a cascade of signaling events that results in cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. The EGFR is overexpressed in many human epithelial cancers, and activating mutations in the EGFR are associated with a subset of lung cancers. The EGFR is also the target of several therapeutic agents, including the monoclonal antibody cetuximab and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. The EGFR is also activated by the Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS-R), and activation of the EGFR by FAS-R leads to activation of NF-kB and inhibition of apoptosis. The Fas receptor is activated by binding of Fas ligand (FASL), and activation of the FAS-R pathway leads to apoptosis of the cell that expresses FAS. NF-kB is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the cellular response to stress, including apoptosis. NF-kB is activated by the EGFR, and activation of NF-kB by the EGFR may contribute to the anti-apoptotic activity of the EGFR.",
  "Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue that communicates information about energy stores with the brain and other tissues. Leptin acts on the hypothalamus to regulate energy intake and body weight. One of the sites of action of leptin is the hypothalamus, where it inhibits feeding and increases energy expenditure. Leptin also acts on other sites to regulate metabolism, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Leptin acts through a receptor that is a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Binding of leptin to the leptin receptor activates a signaling pathway that includes phosphorylation of STAT-3, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes. Other signaling pathways activated by leptin include the PI 3-kinase / AKT pathway and the MAP kinase pathway. The leptin receptor is expressed in many tissues in addition to the hypothalamus, including the placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. In placenta, leptin stimulates the expression of the glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4), increasing glucose transport into the placenta and increasing glucose delivery to the fetus. In skeletal muscle, leptin stimulates glucose uptake and glycolysis, increasing the availability of glucose for use by the developing fetus. In the pancreas, leptin stimulates insulin secretion, acting as a beta-cell amplifier. The leptin receptor is also expressed in other tissues, including the brain, but the role of leptin in these tissues is not clear.",
  "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The cause of most cases of ALS is unknown, but mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene are responsible for 2 0% of familial cases. Transgenic mice overexpressing mutant SOD1 develop a motor neuron disease that closely resembles human ALS, providing strong support for the hypothesis that motor neuron death in ALS is the result of a toxic gain of function of mutant SOD1. Mutant SOD1 may cause motor neuron death through a variety of toxic mechanisms, including oxidative stress, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and apoptosis. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > \u2583",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of ligands plays a key role in development and disease through the activation of SMAD transcription factors. TGF-beta ligands are secreted as latent precursors that are activated by the TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII). The type I receptor (ALK5) then phosphorylates the receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), SMAD2 and SMAD3. These in turn associate with SMAD4 and accumulate in the nucleus, where they regulate transcription. Inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs) include SMAD7, which binds to and inhibits ALK5, and SMAD6 and SMAD7, which can each interact with ALK1, ALK2, and ALK3. The balance between the activities of the R-SMADs and I-SMADs determines the cellular response to TGF-beta. The affinity of SMADs for ALKs is different, with SMADs 1, 2, and 3 being the preferred partners for ALK5, and SMADs 6 and 7 being preferred for ALK1, ALK2, and ALK3. This allows TGF-beta to induce the formation of distinct SMAD complexes depending on the ALKs that are activated. TGF-beta signaling is attenuated by the inhibitory SMAD, SMAD6, which binds to ALK5 and prevents the phosphorylation of SMADs 1 and 2.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily contains several members that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and inflammation. The ligands for these receptors are members of the TNF superfamily. The TNF receptor superfamily also contains several members that lack a cytoplasmic domain and that are involved in regulation of cell surface expression of other members of the receptor family.",
  "The pentose phosphate pathway is a major route for the generation of NADPH and pentoses for nucleotide biosynthesis. The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway is located in the cytosol and produces NADPH and ribulose-5-phosphate. The non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway is located in the plastids and produces ribulose-5-phosphate, which is converted to ribose-5-phosphate, ribulose, and xylulose-5-phosphate. The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the biosynthesis of nucleotides. Ribose-5-phosphate is converted to ribose-1-phosphate, which is an important precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis. Xylulose-5-phosphate is converted to xylulose-1-phosphate, which is an important precursor for the biosynthesis of xylans and other complex carbohydrates.",
  "Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that induce apoptosis in virus-infected and tumor cells through the release of cytotoxic granules. Cytotoxic granules contain perforin and granzyme proteins. Perforin forms pores in the plasma membrane of the target cell allowing the release of granzyme proteases into the cytoplasm. Granule-induced apoptosis is initiated by the activation of initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9, which in turn activate the effector caspases, caspase-3, -6 and -7. Caspase-3 is responsible for the cleavage of cellular proteins involved in DNA replication and nuclear envelope breakdown, and the cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate Bid leads to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are activated by oligomerization and cleavage, and are inhibited by the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). Caspase-8 and caspase-9 activate caspase-3 through the adapter protein Apaf-1. Caspase-2 may also play a role in the mitochondrial amplification loop. Granule-induced apoptosis is blocked by Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and may be triggered by the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria.",
  "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are neuropeptides with a widespread distribution in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. They exert a variety of biological actions through specific receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2, which are coupled to Gs and Gq proteins, respectively. Activation of these receptors stimulates the accumulation of cAMP and mobilizes intracellular calcium. The cAMP and calcium signals then activate different signalling pathways. The cAMP pathway activates protein kinase A (PKA) and EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP). The calcium signal activates the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase PKC. Both pathways activate the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein). VIP and PACAP regulate the expression of a variety of genes through this pathway. VIP and PACAP also activate the transcription factor NF-kB through a pathway that does not involve cAMP, PKC or calcium. VIP and PACAP are neurotrophic factors for sympathetic neurons and stimulate neurite outgrowth. The activation of NF-kB by VIP and PACAP may play a role in this process.",
  "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength that is thought to be the molecular basis of learning and memory. The induction of LTP is associated with the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which leads to an increase in the postsynaptic concentration of calcium. The calcium signal activates several signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway. These pathways are thought to be involved in the regulation of gene expression that is required for the maintenance of LTP.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that includes HER2 / neu (ErbB-2), ErbB-3, and ErbB-4. The binding of ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and others to the extracellular domain of the receptor leads to receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase domain. This results in the phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules and the initiation of signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility. Deregulation of EGFR signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human cancers. EGFR gene amplification and / or overexpression have been observed in a variety of human cancers, including glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer. In addition, activating mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been identified in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and downstream signaling pathways and are associated with a more favorable prognosis.",
  "The initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is a highly conserved, multi-step reaction. At the heart of this reaction is the binding of the initiator protein complex, ORC (origin recognition complex), to an origin of replication. ORC consists of six proteins (Orc1-6) and binds to DNA at origins of replication throughout the cell cycle. Two additional proteins, Cdc6and Cdt1, then bind to ORC and recruit additional factors to the origin. Cdc6and Cdt1 then act together to load the Mcm2-7 complex as a double hexamer at the origin. The activation of the Mcm2-7 complex as a helicase at the start of S phase requires the action of two protein kinases, Cdc7p and Dbf4p-Cdc7p. Cdc7p is a protein kinase related to the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Dbf4p is a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK). Cdc2p is a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). The activation of these kinases at the G1 / S phase transition leads to the unwinding of the DNA duplex and the recruitment of DNA polymerases to the origins. The completion of DNA replication requires the inhibition of the initiation step and the inhibition of the elongation step. Two different classes of proteins are involved in these processes. The geminiviruses encode proteins that bind to and inactivate the Orc1p component of the ORC complex, preventing the initiation of DNA replication. The eukaryotic replication checkpoint system responds to DNA damage or blocks to DNA replication by inhibiting the initiation of S phase. The checkpoint kinases, Cds1p and Mec1p, phosphorylate and activate the Dun1p kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc2p. The inhibition of Cdc2p by the checkpoint kinases prevents the activation of the Mcm2-7 complex and blocks the initiation of DNA replication.",
  "The p34 kinase is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stress. The p34 kinase is involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. The p34 kinase is a component of the Map kinase cascade, and is activated by the small G protein ras, acting through Map kinase kinase kinases (MEKK) 1 and 2 and map kinase kinase 3. Map kinase kinase 3 phosphorylates and activates Map kinase kinase 6, which in turn phosphorylates and activates p34 kinase. Map kinase 6 is also known as MKK3 and activated by the tumor suppressor p53. The p34 kinase phosphorylates and activates Map kinase kinases 2 and 3, which in turn activate the p38 kinase and map kinase 1. The p38 kinase in turn phosphorylates and activates Map kinase-activated protein kinase 2, which phosphorylates and activates transcription factors such as ELK-1. The p34 kinase also phosphorylates and activates Map kinase-activated transcription factor-1 (Mapkap2), which may regulate transcription independently of other Map kinase targets.

  "The kappa-opioid receptor is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) gene family. The kappa-opioid receptor is activated by the endogenous opioid peptide, dynorphin, and by the synthetic opioid drug, morphine. The kappa-opioid receptor is widely expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the regulation of pain, anxiety, and drug reward. The activation of the kappa-opioid receptor leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the subsequent reduction of intracellular cAMP levels. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by the kappa-opioid receptor is mediated by the pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein, Gi. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by the kappa-opioid receptor leads to the inhibition of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the subsequent inhibition of the CREB-mediated gene transcription. The inhibition of CREB-mediated gene transcription by the kappa-opioid receptor may also involve the regulation of the phosphorylation of CREB by the PKA-dependent activation of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV). The inhibition of CREB-mediated gene transcription by the kappa-opioid receptor may also involve the regulation of the phosphorylation of CREB by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The activation of the kappa-opioid receptor also leads to the activation of the MAPK pathway. The activation of the MAPK pathway by the kappa-opioid receptor involves the transactivation of the EGF receptor by the G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2).

The activation of Elk-1 by the kappa-opioid receptor may involve the regulation of the phosphorylation of CREB by the MAPK pathway.",
  "Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that plays a key role in development and tissue homeostasis. Wnt ligands are secreted glycoproteins that bind to Frizzled family receptors and activate several different signaling cascades. One of the best characterized Wnt pathways is the canonical Wnt pathway, in which the transcriptional co-activator beta-catenin is stabilized and enters the nucleus to activate transcription. In the absence of Wnt signaling, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by the kinase complex containing glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), axin, and the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and is targeted for degradation by the proteosome. In the nucleus, beta-catenin interacts with the TCF / LEF family of transcription factors to activate transcription of Wnt target genes. Wnt signaling is regulated by several secreted Wnt antagonists including secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF), Cerberus, and Dickkopf (DKK). Wnt signaling is also regulated by several intracellular components, including the APC family of proteins, beta-catenin, and axin. Mutations in components of the Wnt pathway are associated with several types of cancer.",
  "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a key role in the degradation of most cellular proteins. Proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome through the covalent attachment of a chain of ubiquitin molecules. The proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades proteins linked by ubiquitin in a highly conserved pathway. The proteasome is found in the nucleus and cytoplasm and is composed of two multi-subunit complexes, a 20S core particle and a 19S regulatory particle. The 20S core particle is a barrel-shaped structure with a central proteolytic core. The core particle contains three proteolytic activities, one chymotrypsin-like, one trypsin-like and one peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activity. The 19S regulatory particle is a complex that binds to the 20S core particle and is required for the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates by the proteasome. The 19S regulatory particle is composed of at least 1 3 different subunits and is required for the binding and unfolding of proteins prior to their entry into the 20S core particle. The addition of a 19S regulatory particle to the 20S core particle increases the proteolytic activity of the proteasome and allows for the degradation of proteins that are not efficiently degraded by the core particle alone. The 20S core particle is able to degrade intact proteins, proteins that are first modified by multiple ubiquitin molecules, and proteins that are first modified by a single ubiquitin. The 19S regulatory particle is required for the binding and unfolding of proteins prior to their entry into the 20S core particle. The 19S regulatory particle is also required for the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates.",
  "The ATM gene product is mutated in the cancer-prone disorder ataxia telangiectasia. ATM is a protein kinase that is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates many targets, including the tumor suppressor protein p5 3. One of the targets of ATM is the Cdc2 5 phosphatase, which activates the cyclin-dependent kinases that drive the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. Phosphorylation of Cdc2 5 by ATM leads to its degradation, preventing the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases and stopping the cell cycle. Another ATM substrate is the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is also involved in cell cycle control. When activated by DNA damage, p53 causes cells to arrest in G1 and G2, allowing time for DNA repair to occur.

  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a key regulator of cellular functions. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. The regulatory subunits are bound by cAMP and the catalytic subunits are released to phosphorylate downstream targets. The PKA is targeted to specific subcellular locations through association with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are a family of structurally diverse proteins that bind to the regulatory subunit of PKA and target the PKA holoenzyme to specific subcellular locations. AKAPs are involved in a variety of cellular functions including regulation of ion channels, cell shape and motility, and regulation of gene expression. The PKA is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane by the AKAP AKAP1 8delta. The PKA anchored at the outer mitochondrial membrane phosphorylates the mitochondrial protein p21. The phosphorylation of p21 regulates the release of cytochrome c and the induction of apoptosis.",

  "Calcium / Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are a family of serine / threonine protein kinases that are activated by calcium and the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). CaMKs are involved in a variety of cellular functions including gene transcription, neuronal activity, learning and memory, and muscle contraction. There are many different forms of CaMK, including CaMKI, CaMKII, CaMKIV, and CaMK-Gr. CaMKs are activated by different mechanisms. CaMKI and CaMK-Gr are activated by CaMK kinase, which is itself activated by CaMKK. CaMKII and CaMKIV are activated by CaM kinase kinase, which is activated by the CaM kinase pathway. CaMKs are involved in a variety of signaling pathways. For example, CaMKII is involved in the NMDA receptor pathway and is involved in learning and memory. CaMKI is involved in the CREB pathway and is involved in learning and memory. CaMK-Gr is involved in the cAMP pathway and is involved in learning and memory. The CaMK family is part of a larger group of kinases called the CaM kinases. The CaM kinases are activated by calcium through the binding of calcium to calmodulin, and are themselves regulated by phosphorylation. The CaM kinases are regulated by CaM kinase kinase and CaM kinase kinase. CaM kinase kinase is activated by the MAP kinase pathway and is involved in learning and memory. The CaM kinases are also regulated by autophosphorylation. The CaM kinases are inhibited by the CaMK inhibitor protein, CaMKI-K, which is activated by CaM kinase kinase.",
  "The calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are a group of multifunctional serine / threonine kinases that are activated by binding calcium and the regulatory protein calmodulin. CaMKI, CaMKII and CaMKIV are activated by increases in intracellular calcium that occur in response to a variety of stimuli. CaMKI is activated by calcium and calmodulin, but is not regulated by phosphorylation. CaMKI is expressed in brain and other tissues, and is activated by the CaMKK (CaMK kinase). CaMKII is a kinase that is activated by calcium and calmodulin, and is autophosphorylated. CaMKII is autophosphorylated at three sites, and is a calcium-dependent kinase. CaMKIV is activated by calcium and calmodulin, but is not regulated by phosphorylation. CaMKK phosphorylates and activates CaMKIV. The CaMKs regulate a variety of cellular processes in response to calcium signals, including gene transcription, neurotransmitter release, and neuronal plasticity. The CaMKs are also involved in learning and memory processes in animals. The CaMKs are also involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The CaMKs are involved in the regulation of the MAP kinase pathways, including the Erk and JNK pathways. The CaMKs also regulate the CREB transcription factor, and CREB-mediated gene transcription. The CREB transcription factor is involved in learning and memory processes in animals, and is also involved in cell survival. The CaMKs are also involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The CaMKs are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, and the CaMKs regulate the cell cycle through the phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein p27kip. The CaMKs also regulate apoptosis through the phosphorylation of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by the CaMKs inhibits its anti-apoptotic activity. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by the CaMKs also activates the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by the CaMKs also activates the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by the CaMKs also activates the calcium-induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by the CaMKs also activates the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 in cells that are treated with staurosporine to induce apoptosis. The activation of the CaMKs by calcium also activates the JNK stress-activated protein kinase pathway. The JNK pathway is involved in apoptosis induced by calcium, and the activation of the JNK pathway by the CaMKs may be involved in the activation of apoptosis by calcium. The CaMKs also regulate other cellular processes in addition to gene transcription, including microtubule dynamics and cell cycle progression. The CaMKs are involved in microtubule dynamics through the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins. The phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins by the CaMKs increases their association with microtubules, and may increase microtubule stability. The CaMKs also regulate cell cycle progression through the phosphorylation of the cell cycle regulator protein Cdc2 5C. The phosphorylation of Cdc2 5C by the CaMKs activates the phosphatase activity of Cdc2 5C, and activates the cell cycle kinase Cdc2. The activation of Cdc2 by the CaMKs may be involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression by calcium. The regulation of microtubule dynamics and cell cycle progression by the CaMKs may also be involved in other cellular processes regulated by calcium, such as cell motility and cell division.",
  "Interleukin-1 2 (IL-1 2) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the development of Th1 cells, which are involved in cell-mediated immunity. IL-1 2 is produced by antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and B cells, in response to stimulation by microbial products such as LPS. IL-1 2 stimulates the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and induces the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and adhesion molecules on antigen-presenting cells. IFN-gamma produced by Th1 cells in response to IL-1 2 stimulates the expression of MHC and adhesion molecules on antigen-presenting cells, and enhances their antigen-presenting activity. IL-1 2 also stimulates the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of Th1 cells. IL-1 2 is produced primarily by activated macrophages and B cells, and its production is induced by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other microbial products. IL-1 2 is a heterodimer, composed of p3 5 and p4 0 subunits. The IL-1 2 receptor is a heterodimer, composed of IL-1 2 receptor beta1 (IL-1 2Rbeta1) and IL-1 2 receptor beta2 (IL-1 2Rbeta2) subunits. IL-1 2Rbeta1 is a component of the receptor for IL-2 3, a cytokine that shares some of the activities of IL-1 2. IL-1 2Rbeta2 is a component of the receptor for IL-2, a cytokine that plays a key role in the differentiation of Th2 cells.

  "The growth hormone (GH) -insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis plays a key role in growth and metabolism. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen and anti-apoptotic factor. The GH receptor (GHR) is a cytokine receptor that activates several signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT, MAPK, and PI3 kinase pathways. The PI3 kinase pathway is activated by binding of the GH receptor-associated kinase JAK2 to the 100 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase phosphorylates phosphoinositides to produce the second messengers PIP3 and PIP2. PIP3 activates the kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B. AKT phosphorylates and inactivates the tumor suppressor protein, p190RhoGAP, which in its unphosphorylated form inhibits the activity of the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc-4. PIP3 also activates the kinase PDK1, which activates AKT. AKT phosphorylates and inactivates the forkhead transcription factor FKHR-L1, which regulates genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and metabolism. AKT also phosphorylates and activates the kinase IKK, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NF-kB. NF-kB regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The transcription factor FKHR-L1 also regulates genes involved in metabolism. The transcription factor FKHR-L1 is regulated by phosphorylation, and phosphorylation by AKT causes FKHR-L1 to be retained in the cytoplasm, preventing activation of genes involved in metabolism. The transcription factor FKHR-L1 is also regulated by the kinase IkB kinase, which phosphorylates and inactivates FKHR-L1 in the absence of growth factor signaling.",
  "Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically controlled process that eliminates unwanted or harmful cells. Apoptosis is induced by two major pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by extracellular signals, such as Fas ligand, TNF-alpha, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and TNF-alpha, and mediated by death receptors, such as Fas, TNF-R1, and TRAIL-R1. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by various intracellular stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, and ER stress, and is mediated by mitochondria. Mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis and are regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, prevent the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors from mitochondria. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bax and Bak, induce the release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors from mitochondria. Cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and caspase-9 form the apoptosome, which activates caspase-3 and other caspases. Caspase-3 cleaves various cellular proteins, leading to the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis.",
  "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that is activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The NMDA receptor is a key mediator of excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in a variety of physiological processes including learning and memory. The NMDA receptor is a multi-subunit complex that requires the binding of glutamate, glycine, and two cations (Na +, K +, and Ca 2 +) for channel opening. The NR1 subunit is the essential component of the channel and is required by the other subunits for functional expression. The NR2 subunits (NR2A-2D) determine the properties of the receptor. The binding of glutamate to the NR1 subunit causes a conformational change in the receptor that allows the channel to open. The influx of cations through the NMDA receptor causes membrane depolarization, which in turn activates voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of calcium through the NMDA receptor can activate a variety of calcium-dependent signaling pathways. The binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor also activates a slow, voltage-independent form of desensitization. The binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor also causes the removal of the channel from a high-affinity, magnesium-dependent state to a lower-affinity, magnesium-independent state. This process is regulated by nitric oxide (NO), which activates soluble guanylyl cyclase and increases cGMP levels. The increase in cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which phosphorylates the NR1 subunit at a serine residue. This phosphorylation decreases the affinity of the receptor for magnesium and increases the probability of channel opening. The activation of the NMDA receptor also causes the influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of calcium activates a variety of signaling pathways. The influx of calcium also activates calcium-dependent proteases, calpains, which cleave the NMDA receptor. The cleavage of the NMDA receptor increases the open time of the channel and may also increase the number of channels in the plasma membrane. The activation of the NMDA receptor also causes the influx of sodium, which depolarizes the membrane and activates voltage-gated calcium channels. The activation of the NMDA receptor also causes the influx of potassium, which hyperpolarizes the membrane and may also activate voltage-gated calcium channels. The activation of the NMDA receptor also causes the influx of zinc, which may act as a negative modulator of the NMDA receptor. Zinc is a potent inhibitor of the NMDA receptor at low micromolar concentrations. The influx of zinc through the NMDA receptor is regulated by the membrane zinc concentration. The membrane zinc concentration is regulated by the membrane zinc transporter-3 (ZnT3). The influx of zinc through the NMDA receptor is also regulated by metallothioneins. The influx of zinc through the NMDA receptor is also regulated by nitric oxide. The influx of zinc through the NMDA receptor is also regulated by the redox state of the cell. The oxidation of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the NMDA receptor by reactive oxygen species (ROS) inactivates the receptor. The inactivation of the NMDA receptor by ROS is reversed by the zinc-dependent formation of a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues. The influx of zinc through the NMDA receptor also activates the tyrosine phosphatase STEP. The activation of STEP by zinc causes the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERK1 / 2. The dephosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 activates the transcription of immediate early genes (IEG).",
  "Fibrinogen is a 3 4 0 kD plasma glycoprotein that is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin monomers that polymerize to form the fibrin clot. The fibrin clot is a scaffold for the clotting factors and platelets that form the blood clot. The fibrin clot is a temporary structure that seals off a vessel or organ and is degraded by plasmin to release the cellular components of the clot. Plasmin is a serine protease that is produced by the liver and secreted into the blood to degrade fibrin. Plasmin is inhibited by the serpin family E member plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1). Plasmin is also inhibited by alpha2-antiplasmin, a serum glycoprotein produced by the liver. Plasmin cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin monomers that polymerize to form the fibrin clot. The fibrin clot is degraded by plasmin and the clotting factors to release the cellular components of the clot.",
  "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the growth of benign tumors in multiple organ systems.

  "Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are a key component of the immune system that kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells. CTLs kill target cells by two main mechanisms: the release of perforin and granzyme proteins to induce apoptosis in the target cell, and the interaction of Fas ligand on the surface of the CTL with Fas on the target cell. Perforin and granzyme induce apoptosis in the target cell by activating caspases, a class of proteases that cleave other proteins to induce cell death. The caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that include caspase-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -1 0. The caspases are initially inactive proenzymes that are activated in a proteolytic cascade. Perforin and granzyme induce apoptosis in the target cell by activating caspase-8, a protease that cleaves and activates caspase-3. Caspase-3 in turn cleaves and activates other caspases, including caspase-10, another caspase that is involved in the apoptotic response to Fas. The Jun / AP-1 transcription factor is also activated by perforin and granzyme to induce expression of the Fas ligand gene, which in turn induces apoptosis in the target cell. The Rho GTPases are a family of proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and other cellular processes. The Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor beta (ARHGDIB) is a negative regulator of the Rho GTPases. CTLs induce apoptosis in target cells by activating ARHGDIB, which inhibits the activity of the Rho GTPases, and so prevents the formation of the actin stress fibers that are required for cell survival. The activation of ARHGDIB by CTLs may be a mechanism to prevent the formation of actin stress fibers in the target cell, and so to allow the induction of apoptosis.",
  "The attachment of proteins to the cell membrane by a glycolipid anchor is a common feature of eukaryotes. The glycolipid anchor is called a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. In mammals, GPI anchors are attached to more than 1 5 0 proteins. The anchor is attached to the C-terminus of the protein through a series of reactions that are conserved in all eukaryotes. The first step in anchor biosynthesis is the transfer of N-acetylglucosaminyl (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI), to form GlcNAc-PI. The second step is the addition of phosphoethanolamine (EtN) to the C-1 position of the inositol ring, to form Man-1EtN-1PI. In mammals, this step is catalyzed by glucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GlcNAc transferase). In yeast, the first step is different, and the second step is catalyzed by a different enzyme. In mammals, the third step is the addition of fatty acids to the 2-position of the inositol ring, to form Man-1GlcN-PI. In yeast, the third step is not performed, and the anchor is not lipid-modified. In mammals, the fourth step is the addition of a phosphoethanolamine (EtN) to the C-2 position of the inositol ring, to form Man-1GlcN-1PI. In yeast, the fourth step is not performed, and the anchor is not lipid-modified. In mammals, the fourth step is catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme, GPI-anchor biosynthesis class C (PIG-C). In yeast, the fourth step is catalyzed by GPI-anchor biosynthesis class E (PIG-E). In mammals, the fourth step is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme, GPI-anchor biosynthesis class D (PIG-D). In yeast, the fifth step is the addition of a fatty acid to the 6-position of the Man residue. In mammals, the addition of a fatty acid is not required, and the anchor is not lipid-modified. In yeast, the sixth step is the addition of a side-branch oligosaccharide to the Man-1GlcN-1PI. In mammals, the side-branch oligosaccharide is not required.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly regulated process that ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes prior to cell division. The transition from G1 to S phase is regulated by the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a family of serine / threonine kinases that are activated by association with cyclins. The CDKs are negatively regulated by CDK inhibitors (CKIs). The CDK inhibitors are expressed throughout the cell cycle, but their expression is induced by the tumor suppressor protein, p16INK4a. The p16INK4a protein forms a complex with CDK4 and CDK6, inhibiting their kinase activity and blocking progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The CDK inhibitors also block the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by the CDKs, preventing the release of E2F transcription factors that induce genes required for S phase progression. The CDK inhibitors are also involved in other cellular processes, such as the response to DNA damage.",
  "The transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle is controlled by the maturation promoting factor (MPF), a heterodimer of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) Cdc2 and the cyclin B regulatory subunit. The activation of MPF is regulated by the dual-specificity phosphatase Cdc2 5C and the phosphatase Cdc2-activating phosphatase 2. MPF is maintained in an inactive state by phosphorylation on Thr1 4 and Tyr1 5 by Myt1 and WEE1 kinases and is activated by dephosphorylation of these residues by the phosphatase Cdc2 5C. The activation of MPF is triggered by the accumulation of cyclin B, which is regulated by the APC / C ubiquitin ligase. The maturation-promoting factor is inhibited by the kinase Wee1 and Myt1 and by the kinase PKA. The activity of MPF is regulated by the phosphorylation state of Cdc2 and by the binding of the protein kinase PKA to the regulatory subunit. The maturation-promoting factor is activated by the Mos-MEK-MAPK pathway and inhibited by the PKA pathway.",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to harmful stimuli such as infection or tissue injury. If inflammation persists, it can damage tissues and organs. The inflammatory response is initiated by the activation of macrophages and other cells by inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activated macrophages release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that cause tissue damage. ROS and RNS activate the transcription factor NF-kB, which induces the expression of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis. The glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system is also induced by NF-kB to protect cells from oxidative stress. The xdh gene encodes the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), which produces ROS and RNS when activated. The xdh gene is also induced by NF-kB to produce more XDH. The induction of xdh and glutathione synthesis by NF-kB and xdh by NF-kB may be a positive feedback loop to protect cells from oxidative stress. The induction of xdh by NF-kB may also be involved in the pathogenesis of gout.",
  "Cadherins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins binds to catenins, which in turn bind to actin filaments. The cadherin-catenin complex is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through alpha-catenin. The catenins are a family of proteins that includes beta-catenin, gamma-catenin, p0 0 7 1, and plakoglobin. The cadherin-catenin complex is involved in a variety of cellular functions including cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and signaling. The activity of the cadherin-catenin complex is regulated by phosphorylation of the catenins. Cascades are substrates of the tyrosine kinase Src and the serine / threonine kinase GSK-3. Phosphorylation of beta-catenin by GSK-3 leads to its dissociation from the cadherin complex and its subsequent degradation in the proteasome. Cascades also interact with the cytoplasmic tail of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The interaction of APP with cadherins may regulate cell-cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. The interaction of APP with cadherins may also play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of secreted proteins regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. TGF-beta binds to type II and type I serine-threonine kinase receptors, activating the type II receptor kinase.

The R-SMADs are bound by the co-SMAD, SMAD4, and the complex is translocated to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription. The SMADs interact with other transcription factors, including the forkhead transcription factor, FKHR, and the homeobox transcription factors, HOX and MEIS. SMADs also interact with other signaling pathways, including the Wnt / beta-catenin pathway. Crosstalk between the TGF-beta and Wnt / beta-catenin pathways may be important in cancer progression.",
  "The immune system is composed of cells that respond to specific antigens in the context of MHC molecules. The T cell receptor recognizes specific antigens presented by MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. The T cell receptor is a complex of proteins that includes the CD3 subunits gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta. The T cell receptor is expressed on the surface of T cells only when the CD3 subunits are present. The T cell receptor is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens and the activation of T cells. The T cell receptor is also responsible for the activation of cytotoxic T cells that kill cells that present specific antigens on their surface. The activation of T cells is also regulated by the interaction of the T cell receptor with the CD28 molecule on the surface of antigen presenting cells. The CD28 molecule is a co-stimulatory molecule that is expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells and is involved in the activation of T cells. The interaction of the T cell receptor with the CD28 molecule is inhibited by the interaction of the Fas ligand on the T cell with the Fas receptor on the antigen presenting cell. The interaction of the Fas receptor with the Fas ligand induces apoptosis in the antigen presenting cell. The regulation of T cell activation by the interaction of the T cell receptor with the CD28 molecule and the Fas-Fas ligand interaction plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response.",
  "The calpain family of calcium-dependent intracellular proteases is involved in a variety of cellular functions, including signal transduction, cell motility, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation. The calpains are a family of intracellular cysteine proteases that are activated by calcium. The ubiquitous calpains (mu-calpain and m-calpain) are heterodimers consisting of a large catalytic 8 0kDa subunit and a small 30kDa regulatory subunit. The regulatory subunit is encoded by the p30 gene and is expressed as two splice variants, MD2and MD2t. The p30gene also encodes the p23 protein, which is involved in the regulation of the calpains. Calpastatin is a specific calpain inhibitor. Calpastatin is a large (20 0kDa), widely expressed, and highly conserved protein. Calpastatin is a specific calpain inhibitor and does not inhibit other cysteine proteases. Calpastatin has a calpain inhibitory domain (130amino acids), a penta-EF-hand calcium binding domain (4EF-hand domain), and a protease inhibitory domain. Calpain activity is regulated by two mechanisms. One is the direct binding of calcium to the p23domain and the other is the binding of the p30domain to the p28 domain. The p30domain is also involved in the binding of calpastatin. The p30domain is encoded by the p30 gene. The p28 domain is encoded by the p23 gene. The p23 protein is a calpain inhibitor. The p28 domain is also involved in the binding of calpastatin. The p23 protein is a precursor of the p20 inhibitory domain. The p23 protein is cleaved by calpain to release the p20 inhibitory domain. The p20 domain is encoded by the p30gene. The p23 protein is also called 4F2HC. The p20 domain is a domain that is conserved in the EF-hand family of calcium binding proteins. The EF-hand motif consists of two helix-loop-helix structures, each containing a conserved calcium binding loop. The p23 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and is associated with the cytoskeleton. Calpain activity is regulated by the binding of calpastatin to the p20 domain. The p23 protein is localized in the cytoskeleton. The p23 protein is phosphorylated by several protein kinases, including protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and protein kinase G. The phosphorylation of p23 protein by protein kinase C inhibits the inhibitory activity of calpastatin.",
  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a key regulator of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory subunits bound to two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits causes the release of the catalytic subunits, which then phosphorylate downstream targets. The specificity of PKA signaling is achieved through the targeting of the kinase to specific subcellular locations through the interaction of the regulatory subunits with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are a family of structurally diverse proteins that coordinate the targeting, activation and inhibition of PKA and other signaling molecules. AKAP9 5 is a large multifunctional protein that binds to the condensin I complex and the PKA regulatory subunit (RII). The PKA regulatory subunit bound to AKAP9 5 is responsible for targeting the PKA holoenzyme to the condensin I complex. The condensin I complex is a key regulator of chromosome condensation during mitosis. The binding of PKA to AKAP9 5 may regulate the activity of the condensin I complex during mitosis.",
  "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel that is defective in cystic fibrosis. The CFTR protein contains a regulatory domain that inhibits the channel's activity in the absence of cAMP. Binding of the regulatory domain to the channel's channel domain inhibits channel activity. Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain by PKA relieves this inhibition. The CFTR channel is also regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), and by ATP binding and hydrolysis. The NHERF family of PDZ scaffold proteins (NHERF1, NHERF2, and CAP7 0) interact with the regulatory domain of CFTR and regulate its activity. NHERF proteins bind to the regulatory domain of CFTR and also interact with other proteins involved in the regulation of CFTR. NHERF1 and NHERF2 interact with the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of cytoskeletal proteins that interact with the actin cytoskeleton. The interaction of NHERF proteins with the ERM proteins may anchor CFTR to the cytoskeleton and may also affect channel regulation. CAP7 0 interacts with the regulatory domain of CFTR and may act as a chaperone for CFTR folding. The interaction of NHERF proteins with the regulatory domain of CFTR may also affect the interaction of other proteins with CFTR. The interaction of CFTR with the ERM proteins may also affect channel regulation. The interaction of the PDZ scaffold proteins with the regulatory domain of CFTR may also affect the interaction of other PDZ scaffold proteins with CFTR.",
  "Interleukin-1 2 (IL-1 2) is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation of T helper cells and is a key factor in the immune response. IL-1 2 is produced by antigen presenting cells in response to stimulation by microbial products, and stimulates the proliferation of T helper cells and the production of other cytokines. The response of T cells to IL-1 2 is regulated by the state of cellular activation and the state of cellular differentiation. The response of T cells to IL-1 2 is inhibited by interferon-gamma, a cytokine produced by T cells that is stimulated by IL-1 2. Interferon-gamma inhibits the proliferation of T cells in response to IL-1 2 and inhibits the production of other cytokines stimulated by IL-1 2. Interferon-gamma inhibits the response of T cells to IL-1 2 by blocking the expression of genes involved in the response of T cells to IL-1 2. Interferon-gamma inhibits the expression of the IL-1 2 receptor beta 1 chain, which is required for the response of T cells to IL-1 2. Interferon-gamma also inhibits the expression of the Janus kinase JAK2, which is required for the response of T cells to IL-1 2. The inhibition of JAK2 by interferon-gamma may also contribute to the inhibition of the response of T cells to IL-1 2. The inhibition of the response of T cells to IL-1 2 by interferon-gamma may be an important mechanism by which the immune response is regulated.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled process of cell death that is essential for proper development and tissue homeostasis. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases are activated through two main pathways: the extrinsic pathway, triggered by death receptors, and the intrinsic pathway, triggered by a variety of cellular stresses. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by the binding of specific ligands to cell surface receptors, such as FAS, and the TNF receptor family. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by a variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, and ER stress. Both pathways activate the initiator caspase-8, which in turn activates caspase-3, -6 and-7. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 then induce the cleavage of cellular substrates, leading to cell death.",
  "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a highly conserved mechanism that is responsible for the removal of a wide variety of DNA lesions including those induced by UV light. Defects in NER are associated with the human disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is characterized by extreme sun sensitivity and a > 1 0 0 0-fold elevated incidence of skin cancer. In humans, there are at least eight genes (XPA through XPG) that are specifically involved in the repair of helix-distorting lesions by NER. These genes encode proteins that are involved in different steps of the repair process. The first step is the recognition of the lesion by the XPC-hHr2 3B complex. The next step is the formation of an open complex by the cooperative action of the XPB and the XPD helicases. The XPG protein then makes a 5 'incision, followed by the incision by the ERCC1-XPF complex at the 3' side of the lesion. The repair synthesis step is then completed by the action of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon and by the sealing of the DNA strand by DNA ligase I.",
  "The pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents and nucleotides in many organisms. It is found in bacteria, archaea, and plants, but is not found in animals. It involves the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway in which glucose-6P is converted to ribulose-5P, which is then isomerized to xylulose-5P. In the non-oxidative phase, ribose-5P and xylulose-5P are interconverted to ribulose-5P and ribulose-6P, which are converted to the nucleotides R5P and xylulose-5P, respectively. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is an essential compound in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. In the non-oxidative phase, ribose-5P and xylulose-5P are converted to R5P and xylulose-5P, respectively. In addition to these reactions, the reversible reaction of fructose-6P with glyceraldehyde-3P and pyruvate is also involved in the non-oxidative phase.",
  "The progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. It is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates gene expression. The human PR gene is located on chromosome 1 1q2 2-2 3 and is composed of nine coding exons. The PR protein is translated from two different mRNAs that are generated by the use of two different translational start sites in exon 2A. the PR-B protein contains an additional 1 6 4 amino acids at its amino terminus that are absent in the PR-A protein. The PR-A and PR-B proteins are identical in their DNA- and ligand-binding domains, but they differ in their amino and carboxyl terminal domains. The PR-A protein does not bind progestin and functions as a transcriptional repressor of PR-B and other steroid hormone receptors. The PR-B protein is both a transcriptional activator and repressor of gene transcription. The ratio of PR-B to PR-A varies between tissues and changes during development. In the absence of progestin, the PR-A: PR-B ratio is high in the uterus and low in the mammary gland. Binding of progestin to the PR-B causes a conformational change in the receptor that leads to its dimerization, translocation to the nucleus, and binding to progesterone response elements (PREs) or to a progesterone response element half-site (PRE-HS) in the regulatory region of progesterone target genes. The PR-B also interacts with other transcription factors such as Sp1 and c-jun to regulate gene transcription. The transcriptional activity of the PR-B is regulated by phosphorylation in response to progestins. The phosphorylation of the PR-B is mediated by multiple kinases including MAPK, cdk2 and p38. The phosphorylation of the PR-B is associated with its increased transcriptional activity. The regulation of gene expression by the PR is essential for normal reproductive function. The PR is the molecular target for the progestin component of oral contraceptives and for some of the progestational effects of hormone replacement therapy. The PR is also the molecular target for the anti-cancer drugs used in the treatment of breast cancer and endometriosis.",
  "Leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation is a multistep process that requires the sequential interaction of various adhesion molecules expressed on the surfaces of leukocytes and endothelial cells. During the initial step of this process, P- and E-selectins expressed on activated platelets and endothelial cells bind to their ligands, P- and E-selectins' ligands (PSGL-1 and PECAM), respectively, and initiate transient interactions between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium. This interaction triggers the activation of leukocyte integrins, LFA-1 and Mac-1, and their subsequent firm adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte integrins bind to their ligands, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and strengthen their interactions with each other. Finally, leukocytes move across the endothelium and migrate into the surrounding tissues in response to a variety of chemokines.",
  "The high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (Fc epsilon RI) is the central mediator of allergic responses. Cross-linking Fc epsilon RI on mast cells by antigen results in the release of preformed granules and the synthesis and release of lipid mediators and cytokines. The release of these mediators causes a rapid inflammatory response and vasodilation. The activation of Fc epsilon RI also induces a state of transcriptional activation in the mast cell. This leads to the expression of a variety of proteins that are involved in the inflammatory response. The signaling pathways that lead to degranulation and transcriptional activation are distinct, but both require activation of the MAP kinase pathways. Degranulation is dependent on the activation of phospholipase C and the release of calcium from intracellular stores. The activation of protein kinase C is also required. Transcriptional activation is dependent on the activation of the Map kinase pathways and the transcription factors NF-AT, NF-IL-6 and AP-1.",
  "The interferon-beta (IFNB) gene is induced by a variety of stimuli, including virus infection, double-stranded RNA, and lipopolysaccharide. The IFNB gene product is secreted and binds to a cell surface receptor to induce a cellular antiviral state. The IFNB promoter contains binding sites for a number of transcription factors, including IRF1, IRF2, NF-kB, and AP-1. The induction of the IFNB gene by these factors is amplified by positive feedback mechanisms involving the transcription factors themselves and other transcription factors. The IFNB gene is also induced by the cytokine interferon alpha (IFNA), and the two genes are coordinately induced by many stimuli. The IFNB gene is also induced by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but the IFNB gene is not induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of the IFNA gene. The IFNB gene is also induced by the cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), but these genes are not coordinately induced with the IFNB gene. The IFNB gene is also induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, but the IFNB gene is not induced by the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. The IFNB gene is not induced by the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil, indicating that the induction of the IFNB gene is not a general response to DNA damage. The IFNB gene is also induced by heat shock, but the induction by heat shock is transient and does not lead to the accumulation of high levels of IFNB mRNA. The IFNB gene is also induced by hypoxia, but the induction is transient and does not lead to the accumulation of high levels of IFNB mRNA. The IFNB gene is also induced by exercise, but the induction is transient and does not lead to the accumulation of high levels of IFNB mRNA. The IFNB gene is not induced by the stress of osmotic stress. The IFNB gene is also not induced by osmotic stress.",
  "The insulin receptor (INSR) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene family. The INSR is activated by binding of insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The INSR is expressed in many tissues, including skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue, and the brain. The INSR is a key regulator of glucose metabolism and is a major target for the treatment of type II diabetes. The INSR is a disulfide-linked heterodimer consisting of two extracellular alpha subunits and two transmembrane beta subunits. The INSR beta subunit contains the tyrosine kinase domain and the INSR alpha subunit is required for INSR expression and plasma membrane targeting. The INSR is activated by binding of insulin or IGF-1, resulting in receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation of the receptor kinase. The INSR activates several signaling pathways, including the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK kinase pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the JAK-STAT pathway. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK kinase pathway is activated by both the Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms. The Ras-independent pathway is activated by Grb-2 and the tyrosine kinase c-Src. The Ras-dependent pathway is activated by the association of Grb-2 with the IRS-1 adaptor protein. The PI3K pathway is activated by the binding of the adaptor protein IRS-1 to the regulatory subunit of PI3K. The JAK-STAT pathway is activated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of the INSR beta subunit and the subsequent binding of JAK kinases to the INSR beta subunit. The activation of these signaling pathways by the INSR contributes to the regulation of glucose metabolism by insulin.",
  "The calcium-activated protease calpain is a heterodimer consisting of a large 8 0kDa catalytic subunit and a small 30kDa regulatory subunit. Calpain is activated by calcium and results in the limited proteolysis of a variety of intracellular proteins. The activity of calpain is regulated by the reversible binding of the small regulatory subunit to the large catalytic subunit. The binding of calcium to the EF hand motifs of the regulatory subunit causes a conformational change in the enzyme that exposes a new surface for protein-protein interactions. Calpain has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis, cell motility, and signal transduction. The activity of calpain is regulated by the reversible binding of the small regulatory subunit to the large catalytic subunit. Calpastatin is the only known inhibitor of calpain. Calpastatin is a large, specific inhibitor of calpain. Calpastatin is a large protein with eight inhibitory domains that are each homologous to the calpain large subunit inhibitory sequence. The inhibitory domains are arranged in tandem and are separated by short, protease sensitive, sequences. The inhibitory domains are separated by large, protease resistant sequences. The protease sensitive sequences are cleaved by calpain to release the active inhibitory domains. Calpastatin is an effective inhibitor of calpain in vitro, but is not required for calpain activity in vivo. Calpastatin is localized to the cytosol and is not associated with the plasma membrane, mitochondria, or nucleus. Calpastatin is not a substrate of calpain. The activity of calpain is also regulated by the interaction of the regulatory subunit with caldopathy inhibitor. The interaction of the regulatory subunit with the catalytic subunit is regulated by calmodulin. Calmodulin binds to the regulatory subunit in the absence of calcium and is displaced by calcium binding. Calpain also interacts with a variety of other proteins through its non-catalytic subunit.",
  "The release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are lipid mediators that play a key role in many physiological and pathological processes. The first step in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids is the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by PLA2. There are two major groups of PLA2, secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) and cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). sPLA2 is extracellular and is activated by interaction with membrane phospholipids or by a variety of agents including calcium ions. cPLA2 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that is present in an inactive form in the cytosol. The activity of cPLA2 is regulated by intracellular calcium concentration and phosphorylation. The activity of cPLA2 is also regulated by the concentration of free fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid. Once activated, cPLA2 translocates to the membrane where it cleaves membrane phospholipids, releasing arachidonic acid. The release of arachidonic acid by cPLA2 is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids.",
  "The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a transmembrane protein complex that plays a critical role in the development and function of B cells. The BCR is composed of two immunoglobulin chains (Ig-alpha and Ig-beta) associated with two Ig-gamma and Ig-delta chains. The cytoplasmic portion of the Ig-alpha and Ig-beta chains contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that are required for BCR signaling. The binding of antigen by the BCR initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of nuclear factor-AT (NF-AT), nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), and activator protein-1 (AP-1). The activation of these transcription factors ultimately results in the transcriptional activation of a variety of genes involved in B cell proliferation and differentiation.",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies to self-antigens. The production of autoantibodies is thought to be caused by the loss of tolerance to self-antigens, which are presented in the form of apoptotic cells or nuclear debris, in the context of an abnormal cytokine environment. The presence of autoantibodies is associated with the formation of immune complexes that are deposited in the glomeruli of the kidney, causing glomerulonephritis. The presence of immune complexes in the circulation causes the activation of complement and the recruitment of inflammatory cells, which leads to tissue damage.",
  "The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is activated by its ligand SDF-1 / CXCL1 2. This chemokine is expressed by bone marrow stromal cells and is also found in the brain, lung, liver, and small intestine.

The interaction of SDF-1 / CXCL1 2 with CXCR4 also plays a role in HIV infection. The interaction of SDF-1 / CXCL1 2 with CXCR4 also plays a role in the retention of lymphocytes in the bone marrow. The interaction of SDF-1 / CXCL1 2 with CXCR4 activates a variety of signaling pathways in lymphocytes. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, calcium flux, and the activation of protein kinase C are all involved in CXCR4 signaling. The activation of these signaling pathways leads to the activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-AT. The activation of these transcription factors leads to the activation of genes such as the IL-2 gene. The activation of CXCR4 also leads to the activation of focal adhesion kinase and the small G-protein Rac. These signaling pathways lead to the activation of cytoskeletal changes and changes in cell shape. The activation of CXCR4 also leads to the activation of PI3 kinase and the AKT pathway. The activation of PI3 kinase and AKT leads to the inhibition of apoptosis in lymphocytes.",
  "The regulation of gene expression by steroid hormones is a complex process that involves the interaction of steroid hormone receptors with a variety of transcription factors. The interaction of steroid hormone receptors with transcription factors is influenced by the cell and promoter context as well as by the presence of other transcription factors. The interaction of steroid hormone receptors with transcription factors can be either positive or negative, depending on the promoter context and the transcription factors involved. The interaction of steroid hormone receptors with transcription factors can be direct or indirect. In the direct interaction, the steroid hormone receptor binds to a specific DNA response element and then interacts with and influences the activity of a transcription factor. In the indirect interaction, the steroid hormone receptor interacts with another transcription factor and then interacts with the transcription factor to alter its activity. The interaction of steroid hormone receptors with transcription factors can be influenced by the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor. The interaction of steroid hormone receptors with transcription factors can also be influenced by the cell cycle. The interaction of steroid hormone receptors with transcription factors can also be influenced by the presence of other proteins.",
  "Bile acids are a class of steroid carboxylic acids that are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. Bile acids are conjugated with taurine or glycine before secretion into the intestine. In the intestine, bile acids are conjugated with taurine or glycine before being secreted into the intestine. Bile acids are amphipathic molecules that are essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and sterols. Bile acids are also signaling molecules that regulate metabolism and homeostasis of glucose and lipids. Bile acids activate the nuclear receptor FXR to induce the expression of the bile acid efflux pump BSEP and the ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP). FXR also induces the expression of the short heterodimer partner SHP, which in turn represses the expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis. Bile acids also activate the nuclear receptor LXR to induce the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 and the cholesterol ester transfer protein CETP. ABCA1 mediates the efflux of cellular cholesterol to lipid-poor apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI) to form nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, which are the first step in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. CETP catalyzes the transfer of cholesterol ester from HDL to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins for the formation of HDL3. Bile acids also activate the G-protein coupled receptor TGR5, which increases energy expenditure by increasing energy expenditure and reducing food intake. TGR5 is expressed in the enterochromaffin cells of the intestine, where it stimulates the release of serotonin, which activates brown adipose tissue to increase energy expenditure. Bile acids also activate the nuclear receptor PXR, which induces the expression of cytochrome P4 5 0 enzymes involved in the metabolism of bile acids and xenobiotics. The activation of PXR by bile acids may also protect against the toxicity of bile acids.",
  "The mTOR pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. mTOR is a serine / threonine kinase that exists in two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is composed of mTOR, mLST8, PRAS4 0 and raptor and is sensitive to the macrolide rapamycin. Growth factors activate the class I PI3-kinase pathway, which in turn activates AKT. AKT phosphorylates TSC2, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the small G protein Rheb. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AKT inhibits the GAP activity of TSC2 towards Rheb, leading to an accumulation of active Rheb-GTP and activation of mTOR. Activated mTOR phosphorylates the 4EBP-1 and S6K1 kinases, which regulate protein translation. The mTORC2 complex is composed of mTOR, mLST8, rictor, Sin1 and protor. It is insensitive to rapamycin and does not appear to regulate the phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 or S6K1.",
  "The D1 dopamine receptor is coupled to Gs and activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP levels. The cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates DARPP-3 2, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, at Thr75. pThr75DARPP inhibits the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), resulting in an increase in the phosphorylation of proteins that are substrates of PKA, including CREB. The phosphorylation of DARPP-3 2 at Thr75also inhibits PKA by an auto-inhibition mechanism. The phosphorylation of CREB at Ser1 33by PKA leads to the transcription of genes containing CRE sequences. The activation of PKA also leads to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, resulting in the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser180. pSer180CREB activates the transcription of genes containing the CRE sequence. The D2 dopamine receptor is coupled to Gi / o and inhibits adenylyl cyclase. The activation of the D2 dopamine receptor also leads to the inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway and CREB phosphorylation. The regulation of DARPP-3 2 by dopamine through the D1 and D2 receptors provides a mechanism for the integration of dopamine and glutamate signals in the striatum.",

The GABA (A) R is also the site of action of many drugs that are abused by humans, such as the benzodiazepines, ethanol, and the barbiturates. The GABA (A) R is a chloride channel that opens in response to GABA binding. The binding of GABA opens the chloride channel, which allows chloride ions to flow down their electrochemical gradient down their electrochemical gradient into the cell. The chloride ions flow down their electrochemical gradient down their electrochemical gradient into the cell, causing the cell to hyperpolarize. The binding of GABA to the GABA (A) R opens the chloride channel, which allows chloride ions to flow down their electrochemical gradient down their own electrochemical gradient into the cell. The binding of GABA to the GABA (A) R hyperpolarizes the neuron, reducing the probability of an action potential being generated. GABA (A) Rs are modulated by a variety of drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and general anesthetics. Benzodiazepines are anxiolytic drugs that are used as analgesics and as sedatives. They bind to a site on the GABA (A) R that is distinct from the GABA binding site. Benzodiazepines increase the affinity of the GABA (A) R for GABA and increase the chloride current elicited by GABA. Barbiturates and general anesthetics also enhance the response of the GABA (A) R to GABA. Barbiturates are used as anesthetics and as anticonvulsants. General anesthetics are used to provide general anesthesia. They are used as a general depressant to produce unconsciousness and amnesia.

  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). GVHD is caused by the attack of donor T cells against host tissues, leading to tissue damage and impaired function of vital organs. GVHD is a multi-factorial disease, and is initiated by the recognition of host MHC molecules by donor T cells. The activation of donor T cells is followed by the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2, TNF and IFN-gamma. These cytokines activate host cells and induce apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. The activation of cytotoxic T cells and the release of perforin and granzyme B by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis of target cells. The recognition of host MHC molecules by donor T cells also leads to the activation of host APCs. The activation of host APCs results in the presentation of host MHC-bound peptides to donor T cells, which then proliferate and differentiate into effector cells. The activation of donor T cells is also influenced by the presence of TGF-beta and IL-1 0.",
  "Cross-linking of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) on mast cells by multivalent antigen activates multiple signaling pathways that lead to the release of inflammatory mediators and the subsequent development of an allergic response. Fc epsilon RI aggregation results in the activation of Lyn, Fyn, and Syk tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate multiple substrates, including the adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-7 6. The LAT / SLP-7 6 complex activates the phospholipase C-gamma pathway, which leads to the release of intracellular calcium and the activation of the calcium-dependent protein kinases, calcineurin, and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). The calcium flux also activates the protein kinase C pathway, which leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the production of cytokines. The MAPK pathway is activated by a series of phosphorylation events that are mediated by the adaptor proteins Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1. The activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT by the MAPK pathway leads to the production of cytokines.",
  "Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen that stimulates proliferation of many cell types. IGF-1 binds to a receptor tyrosine kinase (IGF-1R) that is closely related in structure to the insulin receptor. Binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R stimulates proliferation of many cell types, including cells of the nervous system. IGF-1 also has important effects on differentiation of many cell types. The mitogenic effects of IGF-1 are mediated by the Ras / Raf / MAP kinase pathway and the PI 3-kinase pathway. Both pathways converge on the cell cycle machinery to stimulate progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The Ras / Raf / MAP kinase pathway stimulates expression of cyclin D1, which activates the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. These kinases phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), releasing the transcription factor E2F, which stimulates entry into S phase. The PI 3-kinase pathway also stimulates progression through G1, but does not appear to stimulate cyclin D1 expression. The PI 3-kinase pathway stimulates phosphorylation of the protein kinase AKT, which activates the transcription factor NF-AT. The convergence of these two pathways on the cell cycle machinery may contribute to the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate proliferation of many cell types.",
  "TNF-alpha is a cytokine that induces apoptosis in some cells and activates the transcription factor NF-kB in others. The TNF-alpha receptor family includes the 5 5kDa TNF-alpha receptor (TNFR1) and the TNF-alpha receptor 2 (TNFR2). The cytoplasmic domain of TNFR1 contains a death domain that is required for TNF-induced apoptosis and NF-kB activation. The TNF-alpha receptor associated death domain (TRADD) protein is recruited to the receptor upon TNF-alpha binding and recruits the receptor-interacting protein RIP and the TNF-R1 associated factor 2 (TRAF2). RIP and TRAF2 activate NF-kB and JNK signaling pathways. The kinase NIK (NF-kB inducing kinase) is required for NF-kB activation by TNF-alpha and by the lymphotoxin-beta receptor, but not by IL-1R1. The kinase activity of NIK is required for NF-kB activation by NIK and TNF-alpha. The TRAF proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases that may recruit other factors to the TNF-R1 signaling complex. The TRAF-2 associated protein TANK (TRAF-interacting protein) inhibits NF-kB activation by TNF-alpha and TRAF2.",
  "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex mixture of structural and functional macromolecules that provide a structural scaffold and a means of transmitting signals between cells. The ECM is a complex three-dimensional network composed of many different macromolecules, including glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and fibrillar collagen. The major components of the ECM are collagen, laminin, and proteoglycans. The major constituents of the basement membrane are collagen IV, laminin, and proteoglycans. The ECM is closely associated with the plasma membrane and provides a structural scaffold for cells and tissues. Cells adhere to the ECM through transmembrane receptors of the integrin family. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that consist of noncovalently bound alpha- and beta-subunits. There are 1 8 alpha- and 8 beta-subunits that form at least 2 4 different heterodimers with distinct ligand specificities and cellular expression patterns. Integrins transmit signals from the ECM through the cytoskeleton to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The interaction of ECM components with cell surface receptors is important for cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by a variety of growth factors, including EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and heparin binding EGF. The binding of growth factors to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces dimerization and activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as binding sites for signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The binding of signaling molecules to the activated EGFR activates a number of signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, and the JAK / STAT pathway. These signaling pathways ultimately regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and motility.",
  "B cell receptor (BCR) activation is essential for B cell development and function. BCR activation initiates a cascade of protein phosphorylation events that lead to transcriptional regulation. The first step in BCR signaling is the activation of Src-family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), primarily Lyn and Fyn. Src-family PTKs phosphorylate the BCR and provide binding sites for the recruitment of Syk and the Tec-family kinase Btk. The phosphorylation of downstream substrates by Syk and Btk leads to the activation of phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma 2) and the subsequent release of intracellular calcium. The activation of PLC-gamma 2 also leads to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the Ras pathway. The Ras pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factors NF-AT, AP-1 and NF-kB, which in turn activate the transcription of genes involved in B cell activation and proliferation. The activation of NF-AT and NF-kB is dependent on calcium release and the activation of PKC. The activation of AP-1 is dependent on both the Ras pathway and the calcium pathway. The activation of the Tec-family kinase Bmx is also involved in BCR signaling. The activation of Bmx leads to the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 2 and the subsequent activation of calcium release and the Ras pathway.",
  "The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed serine / threonine protein kinase, which is activated by cellular stresses that increase the AMP: ATP ratio, such as glucose deprivation, heat shock, hypoxia, and exercise. Once activated, AMPK acts as a metabolic checkpoint, switching on ATP-generating pathways (such as glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation) and switching off ATP-consuming processes (such as gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis). The kinase is a heterotrimer, with a catalytic alpha subunit and regulatory beta and gamma subunits. Binding of AMP to the gamma subunit causes a conformational change that allows phosphorylation of the alpha subunit by the upstream kinase, LKB1. This phosphorylation event activates the kinase and also creates a docking site for 34-kDa-protein-phosphatase-2CD (PP2Calpha), which dephosphorylates the AMPK alpha subunit, leading to its inactivation. The identification of the AMPK pathway as a metabolic checkpoint has generated considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of AMPK activators for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. The identification of the mitochondrial protein, Cbp48, as an upstream activator of AMPK has provided a new potential target for drugs that activate AMPK.",
  "The protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by proteolytic unmasking of a tethered ligand domain. The tethered ligand domain is specific for each PAR and activates the receptor independent of receptor cleavage. The tethered ligand domain is generated by a protease that is co-expressed with the PAR and can activate the receptor in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. The tethered ligand can also diffuse from the activating surface and activate PARs on cells that are not in immediate proximity to the activating protease. The PAR family includes the thrombin receptor (PAR-1), the coagulation factor receptors (PAR-3 and PAR-4) and the protease-activated receptor for trypsin (PAR-2). PARs are widely expressed in a variety of tissues and cells and are activated by a variety of proteases that are present in the extracellular environment. The PAR-1 receptor is activated by thrombin, the coagulation factor VIIa-tissue factor complex and activated protein C. The PAR-2 receptor is activated by trypsin and factor Xa. The PAR-3 receptor is activated by the trypsin-like protease coagulation factors Xa and IXa. The PAR-4 receptor is activated by trypsin and factor Xa. PAR-1 and PAR-3 are cleaved and activated by proteases that are found in the circulation and are associated with the vascular wall. PAR-2 is activated by trypsin and factor Xa and is found in the gut and lungs. PAR-1 and PAR-3 are important in hemostasis and thrombosis. PAR-1 is activated by thrombin and plays a key role in platelet activation and aggregation. PAR-1 is also important in the vascular response to thrombin. PAR-3 is activated by trypsin and plays a role in the vascular response to trypsin. PAR-3 is also involved in platelet activation. PAR-2 is activated by trypsin and factor Xa and plays a key role in the initial activation of platelets by these proteases. PAR-2 is also involved in the vascular response to trypsin. PAR-4 is activated by trypsin and factor Xa and plays a role in the vascular response to these proteases. The activation of PARs by proteases in the vascular environment may play an important role in vascular inflammation and injury. The activation of PARs by proteases in the extracellular environment may also play a role in the activation of PARs on cells that are not in immediate proximity to proteases. The activation of PARs on platelets may play a role in the development of arterial thrombosis in the setting of atherosclerosis.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that regulates growth and metabolism. The actions of GH are mediated by the GH receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Binding of GH to GHR activates JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, and other signaling pathways. The JAK / STAT pathway is one of the signaling pathways activated by GHR. JAK2 phosphorylates and activates STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5. These transcription factors translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. Another pathway activated by JAK2 is the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway. Ras activates Raf, which activates MEK, which in turn activates ERK. The activation of ERK by GH is rapid and transient, and is not inhibited by the expression of a dominant negative Ras. The activation of ERK by GH is independent of the activation of JAK kinases or STAT transcription factors. The role of ERK in the regulation of gene expression by GH is not yet known. Another pathway activated by JAK2 is the PI3-kinase pathway. PI3-kinase is activated by JAK2 and phosphorylates AKT. AKT is a serine / threonine kinase that regulates many cellular processes including metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis. AKT phosphorylates and inhibits the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. Phosphorylation of Bad by AKT prevents Bad from forming heterodimers with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, and allows them to induce cytochrome c release and apoptosis. AKT also phosphorylates and activates eNOS, increasing NO production. AKT activation by GH may also contribute to the anti-apoptotic actions of GH.",
  "The kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by the endogenous peptide ligand, dynorphin. Dynorphin is derived from prodynorphin and is cleaved by the enzyme prohormone convertase (PC) 1 / 3 to release the endogenous ligand, dynorphin. The activation of KOR by dynorphin leads to the inhibition of pain and other physiological responses. The activation of KOR also produces some of the dysphoric effects of opioids such as a state of dysphoria. The dysphoric effects of KOR activation are mediated by the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and inhibition of cAMP production. The activation of ERK by KOR also leads to the activation of the transcription factor CREB and the expression of the immediate early gene, c-fos. The activation of ERK by KOR is mediated by the G-protein Go, the beta-arrestin scaffolding protein, and the protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent activation of the small G-protein, ras. The activation of the ERK pathway by KOR may contribute to the dysphoric effects of KOR activation.",
  "The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is structurally similar to the insulin receptor (IR). IGF-1R is activated by IGF-1 and IGF-2, and is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. IGF-1R is over-expressed in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. The IGF-1R pathway is an attractive target for cancer therapy. The IGF-1R pathway is similar to the insulin receptor (IR) pathway in that both receptors are tyrosine kinases and both pathways activate the PI3K / AKT pathway and the MAPK pathway. Both pathways regulate protein synthesis and cell growth. The mTOR pathway is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and is activated by both IGF-1R and IR. The PI3K / AKT pathway inhibits GSK-3, which phosphorylates eIF2B, increasing the activity of eIF2B and increasing the rate of translation. The mTOR pathway also regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E-BP. The MAPK pathway also regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase and 4E-BP. The IGF-1R pathway also activates the RAS / RAF / MEK / MAPK pathway, which also regulates protein synthesis. The activation of these pathways by IGF-1R and IR increases the translation of proteins involved in cell growth and proliferation.",
  "The Krebs cycle is a central metabolic pathway that provides NADH and FADH2 for the respiratory chain and also provides precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, and some other important metabolites. The cycle begins with the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. This reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase.

  "The immune system is composed of two major parts, the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Innate immune cells include natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). Macrophages and DCs phagocytose and digest foreign pathogens. Macrophages and DCs secrete cytokines and chemokines to activate the adaptive immune system. Macrophages and DCs present antigen to T cells and stimulate their proliferation and differentiation. Naive T cells are classified into two types, helper T cells (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (Tc). Th cells produce cytokines that regulate the type and function of subsequent immune responses, while Tc cells directly kill infected cells. The adaptive immune system is antigen-specific and is generated through the rearrangement of genes encoding the antigen-specific receptors of B and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that provide humoral immunity by binding to antigens and activating complement proteins. T cells recognize antigen in the context of MHC molecules and stimulate further proliferation and differentiation of B and T cells.",
  "The proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. It is found in all cells and is responsible for the degradation of abnormal proteins and the processing of proteins involved in many cellular functions. The proteasome is a cylindrical structure with a molecular weight of about 10 0000 00Da. It is composed of two multi-subunit rings stacked on each other to form a 26S structure. The outer ring is composed of 6subunits (PA700) and the inner ring of 14 subunits (PA280). The PA280 ring contains the proteolytic activity, which is carried out by three different proteases, trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide-hydrolyzing (PGPH) activities. The PA700 ring contains the ubiquitin receptors that bind to ubiquitin-tagged proteins and the PA280 ring contains the ATPases that unfold the proteins and feed them into the catalytic center of the 20S particle. The PA280 ring is also called the PA700 ring because of its size and structure. The PA700 ring is called PA700 if not stated otherwise.

  "Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium is a key event in inflammation and is mediated by a family of cell adhesion molecules called selectins. The selectin family includes the peripheral node addressin (PNAd), also called the homing receptor for lymphocytes (HHR), and the more recently identified L-selectin, also called MEL-1 4. The PNAd is a mucin on the surface of high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymphoid tissues that binds to the integrin lymphocyte homing receptor (LHR), also called integrin alpha4beta7, expressed on the surface of lymphocytes. The interaction of PNAd and LHR mediates the homing of lymphocytes from the blood to lymphoid tissues. The interaction of L-selectin and its ligand on the endothelium of blood vessels in nonlymphoid tissues mediates the initial rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium prior to firm adhesion and extravasation. The interaction of L-selectin with its ligand is regulated by several different mechanisms, including the expression of different forms of the ligand, the presence of different carbohydrate structures on the ligand, and the binding of calcium ions to the lectin domain of L-selectin.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen that stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation. IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a tyrosine kinase receptor, and activates several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The activation of the MAPK pathway by IGF-1 is Ras-dependent and leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. The activation of the PI3K pathway by IGF-1 leads to the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3. The activation of both pathways is required for IGF-1 induced proliferation. The activation of the MAPK pathway by IGF-1 also leads to the phosphorylation of CREB and the activation of transcription. The activation of the PI3K pathway by IGF-1 leads to the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3, and the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and FKHRL1. The phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and FKHRL1 by AKT leads to their retention in the cytoplasm and the inhibition of transcription. The inhibition of GSK-3 by AKT also contributes to the activation of transcription by beta-catenin. The inhibition of GSK-3 by AKT also contributes to the activation of transcription by beta-catenin.",
  "TNF-alpha is a cytokine that can induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types. TNF-alpha induces apoptosis through two different pathways. The first pathway is dependent on the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB and involves the induction of the expression of the gene encoding the protease caspase 8. Caspase 8 in turn activates caspase 3, a protease that induces apoptosis. The second pathway is independent of NF-kB and caspase 8 and does not involve caspase 3. This pathway involves the translocation of the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus where it induces apoptosis. The activation of NF-kB by TNF-alpha is blocked by ceramide, a lipid second messenger generated by the action of neutral sphingomyelinase. The activation of NF-kB by TNF-alpha is also blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 1 2-myristate 1 3-acetate (PMA). The inhibition of NF-kB activation by ceramide and PMA may be due to the activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway by ceramide and the activation of the MAPK pathway by PMA.",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease that is characterized by progressive dilation and impaired contractile function of the left ventricle. The hallmark of DCM is dilatation of the left ventricle with normal or slightly increased wall thickness. The prognosis is poor, with a high incidence of sudden cardiac death. Familial forms of DCM are recognized in approximately 3 0% of patients with DCM. Genetic studies have revealed that mutations in at least 1 1 genes are responsible for familial DCM. These genes encode cytoskeletal / Z-disc proteins (actin, tropomyosin, desmin), a cytoskeletal / nuclear protein (Titin), a sarcomere protein (myosin), a calcium-handling protein (phospholamban), an energy metabolism protein (creatine kinase), an ion channel (sodium / potassium-transporting ATPase), and an extracellular matrix protein (laminin). The mutant proteins are thought to be responsible for the development of DCM through various mechanisms, including abnormal force generation, abnormal force transmission, abnormal force decay, abnormal intracellular calcium, abnormal calcium handling, and / or abnormal stretch response.",
  "The Janus kinase (JAK) / signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway is a key component of cytokine signaling. Cytokines bind to their cognate receptors and activate JAK kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors. The JAK / STAT pathway is conserved from insects to mammals and is involved in development, differentiation and proliferation of a variety of cell types. Constitutive activation of the JAK / STAT pathway has been implicated in a variety of human cancers.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multi-subunit complex that recognizes peptide antigens in the context of MHC molecules. The TCR is essential for the development and function of T cells. Engagement of the TCR by antigen-MHC complexes initiates a cascade of signaling events that lead to T cell activation and proliferation. The TCR complex is composed of two distinct families of proteins, the TCR-alpha and -beta chains and the CD3-gamma, -delta, -epsilon and -zeta chains. The CD3 chains are required for the expression of the TCR on the cell surface and are responsible for the signal transduction function of the TCR. The TCR-alpha and -beta chains are not required for TCR expression or signal transduction, but are required for the recognition of antigen. The CD3 chains are required for the initiation of signaling by the TCR and are responsible for the signal transduction function of the TCR. The CD3 chains associate with several other proteins to form the complete TCR complex. Upon TCR engagement by antigen-MHC, the src kinases Lck and Fyn phosphorylate the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 chains. Phosphorylation of the ITAMs creates docking sites for the tyrosine kinase ZAP7 0, which is activated by Lck and Fyn. Recruitment of ZAP7 0 to the TCR results in the phosphorylation and activation of downstream targets. The Tec family kinase Itk is also recruited to the TCR and may contribute to the activation of ZAP7 0. The downstream targets of ZAP7 0 include the adaptor protein LAT and the tyrosine kinase Sos-1. The activation of LAT and Sos-1 leads to the activation of the Ras pathway and the downstream kinases Erk and JNK. The activation of the transcription factors NFAT, AP-1 and NF-kB leads to the transcriptional activation of genes involved in T cell activation and proliferation.",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a key role in development of many different organ systems in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In vertebrates, Hh signaling is required for the development of the brain, the axial skeleton, the skin, and the lungs. Hh signaling is also involved in the development of several types of cancer. The protein ligands of Hh family bind to Patched (Ptc), a twelve-pass transmembrane protein, and to Smoothened (Smo), a seven-pass transmembrane protein. Binding of Hh to Ptc relieves Ptc-mediated inhibition of Smo, which in turn activates a signal transduction pathway that includes the Gli family of transcription factors.",
  "The cell cycle is a sequence of events that includes DNA replication and mitosis. The G1 phase is the period of the cell cycle when cells prepare to enter S phase. The G2 phase is a period of preparation for mitosis. The M phase is the period of cell division. The transition from one phase to another is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are a family of serine / threonine protein kinases that are activated by binding to a cyclin subunit. The activity of CDKs is regulated positively by cyclins and negatively by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs). The activity of CDKs is also regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The activity of CDKs is required for the progression of the cell cycle from one phase to another. The transition from one phase to another is controlled by the concerted action of CDKs and CDKIs. The activity of CDKs is required for the progression of the cell cycle from one phase to another. The activity of CDKs is required for the G1 / S transition and the G2 / M transition. The activity of CDKs is also required for the progression of mitosis. The activity of CDKs is inhibited by CDKIs. CDKIs are a group of proteins that inhibit the activity of CDKs. There are two families of CDKIs: the INK4 family and the Kip / Cip family. The INK4 family of CDKIs includes p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p15INK4c and p103CDKIs are negative regulators of the cell cycle that include p15INK4b, p17Kip1, p27Kip1 and p21Cip1. The Kip / Cip family of CDKIs includes p300Kip1, p105Kip2, p27Kip1 and p132Kip1. p16INK4a is the first CDKI discovered. The p16INK4a / CDKI is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in human cancers.",
  "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 8 0% of all lung cancers. The most common histologic subtype of NSCLC is adenocarcinoma. Smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Adenocarcinomas are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers. Adenocarcinoma is more common in women than in men. Adenocarcinoma is more common in nonsmokers than in smokers. Adenocarcinomas are more common in women than in men. The incidence of adenocarcinoma has been increasing over the past several decades, particularly among women. The discovery of specific molecular changes in lung cancer has led to the development of new drugs that target these changes. These new drugs have improved the treatment of lung cancer and have the potential to further improve outcomes. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell-surface receptor with an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor leads to receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene lead to ligand-independent activation of the receptor and downstream signaling. These mutations are more common in women, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutations are associated with a higher response rate to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib than to standard chemotherapy. EGFR mutations are also associated with a longer progression-free survival and overall survival. The presence of EGFR mutations may be a useful predictor of response to these agents. KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors. BRAF mutations are rare in NSCLC and are associated with a more aggressive clinical course. KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive of EGFR mutations. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is normally expressed in the brain. Chromosomal translocations involving ALK lead to the formation of fusion proteins that have constitutive kinase activity. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene has been identified as a fusion partner of ALK in NSCLC. The presence of EML4-ALK fusion proteins may identify a new molecular subset of NSCLC.",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells that contain more than 60 hydrolases involved in the degradation of macromolecules entering the cell via endocytosis, phagocytosis, or autophagy. The enzymes are packaged into membrane-bounded vesicles called lysosomes by a process that requires the action of the small GTPase Rab7. Lysosomes are acidified by the vacuolar-type ATPase (v-ATPase), which is a multisubunit protein complex. The proton gradient established by v-ATPase is used to drive the transport of other molecules into the lysosome lumen. The low pH is essential for the activity of lysosomal hydrolases and also for the maturation of lysosomal proteins. The formation of lysosomes is a multistep process that requires the participation of the clathrin-dependent and -independent pathways.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that plays a role in inflammation, the immune response, and hematopoiesis. IL-6 signals through a receptor complex that includes the IL-6 receptor alpha chain (IL-6Ralpha) and the signal transducing protein gp1 3 0. The cytoplasmic domain of gp1 3 0 is required for signaling, and contains a number of tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated upon IL-6 treatment. The tyrosine phosphorylation of gp1 3 0 leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the JAK / STAT pathway, the Ras / MAPK pathway, and the PI3 kinase pathway.",
  "The induction of apoptosis by cytotoxic T cells is essential for the immune system to eliminate virus-infected cells. Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) induce apoptosis in target cells by two distinct pathways. The first pathway is triggered by the interaction of the Fas ligand on the surface of the CTL with its receptor on the surface of the target cell. The second pathway is triggered by the perforin / granzyme proteins that are released from the CTL into the target cell's cytoplasm. Perforin forms a pore in the membrane of the target cell, allowing the granzyme proteases to enter the target cell. Granzyme A and B are the two major proteases released by CTLs. Granzyme A cleaves the caspase-3 protease, which leads to the degradation of cellular proteins and the induction of apoptosis. Granzyme B cleaves caspase-3, but also cleaves other caspases and other cellular proteins. The cleavage of caspase-3 by Granzyme B is an important step in the induction of apoptosis by CTLs. The induction of apoptosis by the perforin / granzyme pathway is essential for the immune system to eliminate virus-infected cells. The perforin / granzyme pathway is also used by other immune cells to kill target cells. The failure of the perforin-dependent immune response can lead to the uncontrolled growth of virus-infected cells and the development of autoimmune diseases.",
  "Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Stra\u00fcssler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) and Kuru. The infectious agent responsible for prion diseases is thought to be PrPSc, an abnormal form of the prion protein (PrPC). The conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is a posttranslational process that occurs after PrPC has been synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In sporadic CJD, the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc occurs spontaneously. In genetic CJD, GSS and familial CJD, mutations in the PRNP gene lead to an increased conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. The conversion of PrPC to PrPSc may lead to neuronal death through several different mechanisms. One possibility is that PrPSc accumulates in the ER, triggering an ER stress response. Another possibility is that PrPSc accumulates in lipid rafts, altering signal transduction pathways. A third possibility is that PrPSc may act as a template to convert normal PrPC to PrPSc, leading to a self-propagating process.",
  "The immune system consists of two major cell types, the lymphocytes and the macrophages. Each type of cell responds to signals from the other cell type. Macrophages respond to bacterial products like LPS by secreting cytokines like IL-1 and IL-6. These cytokines stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of B cells and T cells. T cells respond to bacterial products like LPS by secreting IL-2 and IL-4. T cells also respond to antigen presented by MHC-II on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). T cells respond to antigen presented by MHC-II by secreting IL-2 and other cytokines that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of B cells. T cells also secrete a protein called CTLA-4 that binds to the same ligand as CD2 8 and blocks the costimulatory signal.",
  "Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in a variety of biological processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair, transcription, membrane trafficking, etc. The ubiquitination process is carried out by a cascade of reactions involving three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). E1 activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent manner and then transfers it to the active-site cysteine of a conjugating enzyme (E2). An E3 recognizes specific protein substrates and brings them into proximity with the E2 enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and the amino group of a lysine residue of the substrate protein. There are two major types of E3s: HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) -type E3s and RING (really interesting new gene) -finger-type E3s. HECT-type E3s have a conserved cysteine residue that forms a thioester intermediate with ubiquitin during the reaction. They then transfer the ubiquitin to the substrate they are bound to, whereas the RING-finger-type E3s do not form a thioester intermediate. They function as scaffolds to bring the E2 and the substrate together and facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate.",
  "The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors that recognize conserved microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The signaling pathways activated by TLRs are similar to those induced by the T-cell receptor (TCR), and are dependent on the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 8 8 (MyD8 8). The MyD8 8-dependent pathway leads to the activation of NF-kB and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas the MyD8 8-independent pathway leads to the activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and the production of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-beta.",
  "The actions of the peptide hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), are mediated by a guanylyl cyclase-linked receptor (NPR-A) and a receptor with guanylate cyclase activity (NPR-C). The NPR-A receptor is found on the surface of essentially all cell types, whereas the NPR-C receptor is found in high density in the kidney, heart and adrenal medulla. The NPR-C receptor is also found in low density on platelets and in high density on adrenal cortical cells. ANP is released from atrial myocytes in response to increased blood volume, and acts to reduce blood pressure by a combination of diuretic, natriuretic and vasodilator actions. The major action of ANP is to reduce the volume of extracellular fluid by acting through the NPR-A receptor on the renal collecting duct to increase water and sodium excretion. The natriuretic response is mediated by cyclic GMP, which stimulates the opening of potassium and chloride channels, and the closure of the renal cortical Na + channel. The vasodilator actions of ANP are mediated by cyclic GMP and the subsequent activation of nitric oxide synthase and the production of cGMP in the vascular endothelium. The subsequent release of nitric oxide and activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle cells leads to the formation of cGMP and the subsequent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.",

  "Allergy is an immune response to an antigen that causes an individual to become sensitized to that antigen. The response is mediated by IgE antibodies that bind to antigen on mast cells and other cells. The antigen is taken up by the cells and presented to T cells in the context of MHC class II molecules. The T cell receptor recognizes the complex of antigen, MHC class II, and a peptide derived from the antigen. The T cell response is regulated by cytokines produced by other cells in the immune system. IL-4 and IL-5 are important in the development of eosinophils. IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulate the proliferation of eosinophils.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors that promotes neuronal survival and growth. NGF is expressed in the skin and is released by keratinocytes to act on neurons in the skin. NGF binds to TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, on the surface of sensory neurons and activates signaling pathways that promote neuronal survival and growth. NGF also binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family, and this binding can either enhance or inhibit NGF signaling. Binding of NGF to TrkA activates the Ras / Map kinase pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway to promote neuronal survival and growth. NGF binding to p75NTR can activate the Map kinase pathway and PI3 kinase pathway to promote neuronal survival and growth. NGF also induces the expression of p75NTR and TrkA through a positive feedback loop. The p75NTR can also be activated by the p75NTR-signaling molecule B-cell activating factor (BAFF) to promote neuronal survival and growth. NGF also activates the Map kinase pathway and PI3 kinase pathway to promote neuronal differentiation. NGF signaling through TrkA and p75NTR can also activate the JAK / Stat pathway to promote neuronal survival and growth.",
  "The estrogen receptor (ER) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family that includes the glucocorticoid, progesterone, androgen, and mineralocorticoid receptors. The ER is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates the expression of target genes in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The estrogen receptor is expressed in two forms, ERalpha and ERbeta, which are encoded by distinct genes. The two receptors share 9 7% homology in their DNA binding domains and 5 9% in their ligand binding domains. The estrogen receptor is expressed in a variety of tissues including the uterus, ovaries, bone, and the breast. The estrogen receptor is activated by binding to estrogen, which induces a conformational change in the receptor that allows it to bind to estrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoter regions of estrogen-responsive genes. The estrogen receptor can also regulate gene expression through a non-classical mechanism that does not involve direct binding to DNA. The estrogen receptor can interact with other transcription factors such as AP-1 and Sp1 to regulate gene expression. The estrogen receptor can also regulate gene expression through a protein-protein interaction with other signaling pathways. The interaction of the estrogen receptor with the c-Src tyrosine kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been well studied. The estrogen receptor can interact with c-Src through the MAPK scaffolding protein, MNAR. The interaction of the estrogen receptor with MNAR allows estrogen to activate c-Src and the MAPK pathway in a rapid, non-nuclear estrogen receptor-dependent manner. The interaction of the estrogen receptor with Shc and the activation of the MAPK pathway also occurs through Shc. The interaction of the estrogen receptor with the MAPK pathway also occurs through Shc. The interaction of the estrogen receptor with Shc allows estrogen to activate the MAPK pathway in a non-nuclear estrogen receptor-dependent manner. The interaction of the estrogen receptor with the MAPK pathway also occurs through Shc. The interaction of the estrogen receptor with Shc also allows estrogen to activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway.

  "The PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are discrete nuclear substructures that are disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein. PML-NBs are associated with a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and cell cycle control. The PML protein is a key component of PML-NBs and is essential for the formation of PML-NBs. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is another key component of PML-NBs. The PML-RARalpha fusion protein disrupts the formation of PML-NBs and sequesters p53 in the fusion protein-containing nuclear bodies. The disruption of PML-NBs and the sequestration of p53 by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein may contribute to the pathogenesis of APL. The Fas ligand (FasL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. Fas is a cell surface receptor that induces apoptosis in cells that are triggered to express Fas ligand. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role in the immune system by inducing apoptosis in activated T cells and cytotoxic T cells. PML-NBs are associated with the Fas apoptotic pathway. PML-NBs may regulate Fas-mediated apoptosis by controlling the expression of Fas and / or by regulating the Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway. The Fas-mediated apoptosis is also regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The PML-RARalpha fusion protein represses the expression of p53 and represses Fas-mediated apoptosis. The disruption of PML-NBs and the sequestration of p53 by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein may contribute to the pathogenesis of APL.",
  "The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is mutated in the cancer-prone disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT). ATM is activated by ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging agents, and initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or apoptosis. ATM phosphorylates and activates chk1 and chk2, which phosphorylate and inactivate the p21 protein, allowing progression through the cell cycle. ATM also phosphorylates and activates the tumor suppressor gene product p5 3, which induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. ATM also phosphorylates and activates the tumor suppressor gene product BRCA1, which is involved in DNA repair and checkpoint control. The importance of ATM in maintaining genomic integrity is demonstrated by the high incidence of cancer in AT patients and the early onset of cancer in AT patients who are homozygous for ATM mutations. The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that is involved in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. BRCA1 interacts with the ATM kinase and may be a target of ATM phosphorylation. The abl oncogene is involved in cellular transformation and is mutated in some leukemias and breast cancer. The p53 gene product is a tumor suppressor that mediates growth arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. The p53 protein interacts with the ATM kinase and may be a target of ATM phosphorylation. The NFkB transcription factor regulates genes involved in inflammation and immune response, including the expression of cytokines such as TNF-alpha. The NFkB complex is held in the cytoplasm by binding of the IkB inhibitory proteins. Activation of NFkB involves phosphorylation of IkB by the IKb kinase, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome, and subsequent translocation to the nucleus.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation. TGF-beta inhibits the growth of many cell types, including B and T lymphocytes. TGF-beta also induces apoptosis in some cell types. TGF-beta signals through a complex of serine-threonine kinases, including the type II TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR-II), which phosphorylates and activates the type I TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR-I). The activated TbetaR-I phosphorylates the transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then associate with the common mediator SMAD4. Phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 associate with the co-activator CBP / p3 0 0 and other transcriptional regulators to activate transcription. The SMAD proteins are structurally related to Drosophila MAD (mothers against decapentaplegic) and are involved in signaling by other members of the TGF-beta family, including activins, nodals and bone morphogenetic proteins. The SMAD proteins are also involved in signaling by other pathways, including the interferon-response pathway and the Wnt pathway. SMADs are phosphorylated and activated by receptors for these other pathways, but they also interact with other signaling pathways. The SMADs regulate transcription by interacting with other transcription factors, including the homeodomain proteins of the Hox gene family, the paired box proteins involved in development of the midbrain and hindbrain, and the forkhead transcription factor FKHR-L1 involved in development of the liver. SMADs also interact with other transcription factors, including the Ets family transcription factor EGR-1, the bHLH transcription factor Mad, and the NFAT family of transcription factors. The interaction of SMADs with other transcription factors provides a mechanism for integrating different signaling pathways.",
  "The transcription factor NF-kB is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, cell survival, and the immune response. In the absence of a stimulus, NF-kB is retained in the cytoplasm by association with the inhibitor IkB. Various stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines, activate the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates IkB, leading to its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. NF-kB is then free to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription. The TRAF family of proteins are involved in the activation of NF-kB by TNF and other members of the TNF receptor gene family. TRAF2 and TRAF6 are involved in the activation of NF-kB by TNF and other members of the TNF receptor gene family, while TRAF1 is not involved in this pathway. The TRAF proteins themselves are involved in the activation of NF-kB by other receptors, including the CD4 0 receptor, and also in the activation of other signaling pathways. The activation of NF-kB by TNF and other members of the TNF receptor gene family is blocked by the protein kinase RIP, a member of the IRAK family of proteins. RIP interacts with the TRAF proteins involved in NF-kB activation by TNF receptors, but also interacts with the kinase domain of RIP to activate NF-kB. The kinase activity of RIP is required for NF-kB activation, but the target of RIP kinase activity in this pathway is not yet known. The protein kinase MEKK1 is also involved in NF-kB activation by TNF, but MEKK1 does not appear to interact with the TRAF proteins involved in NF-kB activation by TNF. MEKK1 activates the MAP kinase kinase kinase MKK3, which activates the kinase p38, leading to the activation of NF-kB. MEKK1 also activates the JNK kinase MKK4, which activates JNK, and MKK4 is involved in NF-kB activation by TNF. The protein kinase Tpl-2 also activates NF-kB, but does not appear to activate the JNK pathway. The activation of NF-kB by TNF and other members of the TNF receptor gene family is a key component of the inflammatory response, and is blocked by the TNF receptor family member osteoprotegerin, which acts as an inhibitor of bone resorption. The inhibition of bone resorption by osteoprotegerin may be due in part to the inhibition of the activation of NF-kB by TNF.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway for the repair of small base lesions in DNA. BER is initiated by the lesion-specific DNA glycosylase, which recognizes and excises the damaged base. The resulting apurinic / apyrimidinic (AP) site is recognized and incised by an AP endonuclease, creating a single-strand break with 3 '-hydroxyl and 5' -dRP termini. The repair of the 5 '-blocking group is then completed by the sequential actions of DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. BER can also be sub-classified as short-patch BER (repair in one nucleotide) or long-patch BER (repair in 2-1 3 nucleotides). DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) is the major DNA polymerase involved in short-patch BER. DNA ligase I (or DNA ligase III) is then recruited by pol beta and seals the nick. DNA glycosylases that recognize and remove larger lesions, such as N-methyl purine DNA glycosylase (MPG), are involved in long-patch BER. PCNA and FEN-1 are required for the strand displacement synthesis and the formation of the ligatable nick.",
  "The heart is a highly vascularized organ with a constant blood supply. The heart is composed of four chambers, the atria and ventricles, which are separated by septa that contain the conduction system. The ventricles are the largest chambers of the heart and are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. The atria are the smallest chambers, and are responsible for the production of the majority of the cardiac output. The heart is a complex organ with multiple functions. The ventricles pump blood throughout the body, while the atria are responsible for the production of the cardiac impulse.

  "Blood coagulation or clotting is a series of biochemical reactions that leads to the formation of a clot at the site of vascular injury. The clotting cascade begins with the activation of prothrombin by the enzyme thrombin. The activation of prothrombin is initiated by the interaction of the clotting factors with the tissue factor (TF), a protein in the vascular wall exposed to the blood stream in response to vascular injury. The activation of prothrombin by the TF-factor VIIa complex is enhanced by the presence of the coagulation factors V and X and the coagulation factors VII, VIII, and IX. The activation of prothrombin by the TF-factor VIIa complex is inhibited by the protein C pathway. The protein C pathway is a negative feedback system for the regulation of blood coagulation. The protein C zymogen is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. The activated protein C (APC) in the presence of the protein S cofactor inhibits the activation of factors V and VIII by the TF-factor VIIa complex. The inhibition of the TF-factor VIIa complex by the protein C pathway is enhanced by heparin.",
  "The binding of beta-arrestins to agonist-occupied GPCRs leads to the activation of Src and the subsequent phosphorylation of the ERK1 / 2 MAP kinases. This pathway is independent of G-protein activation and is mediated by beta-arrestin scaffolding of Src and the Raf1 kinase. The activation of ERK1 / 2 MAP kinases by the beta-arrestin-Src complex leads to the regulation of a variety of cellular responses, including gene transcription, cell proliferation, and chemotaxis.",
  "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Senile plaques are mainly composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, which are derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage. NFTs are composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs) that are abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. The amyloid cascade hypothesis states that the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is the primary event that triggers a pathogenic cascade that leads to neuronal death. The accumulation of Abeta peptides in the extracellular space may lead to neuronal death through several mechanisms, including the generation of free radicals, calcium (Ca2 +) dysregulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ca2 + dyshomeostasis may be caused by either Abeta oligomers or Abeta fibrils. Abeta oligomers may enter the cell and interact with the membrane, forming cation channels. Alternatively, Abeta oligomers may bind to the prion protein (PrP C), which then interacts with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) to trigger Ca2 + influx. Abeta fibrils may interact with PrP C and activate mGluR5, which leads to the activation of Fyn kinase and the subsequent phosphorylation of tau. Fyn may also contribute to the abnormal phosphorylation of tau by activating cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5). Hyperphosphorylation of tau may lead to destabilization of microtubules and inhibition of axonal transport. Mitochondria are essential for neuronal function and survival. They produce energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and they play a key role in Ca2 + homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which may further damage mitochondria and other cellular components.",
  "The attachment of a protein to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The anchor is attached to the C-terminus of proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a GPI transamidase complex. In yeast, the GPI anchor is synthesized on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane by a pathway involving at least 1 0 different gene products. The core GPI structure is conserved from protozoa to mammals. In mammals, the GPI structure is attached to proteins by the sequential addition of sugars, phosphoethanolamine, and fatty acids.",
  "The BCR gene encodes a protein of approximately 2 1 0 kDa that is a critical component of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex. The BCR complex is found on the surface of all mature B cells and is involved in B cell activation and development. The BCR complex is composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chains, and two heterodimers of the Ig-alpha and Ig-beta proteins. The cytoplasmic domain of the BCR contains several tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated upon BCR ligation and that serve as binding sites for proteins containing SH2 domains. The tyrosine kinase Lyn phosphorylates the Ig-alpha and Ig-beta proteins, creating binding sites for the SH2 domains of the GRB2 and Sos-1 proteins. GRB2 and Sos-1 activate Ras, which in turn activates the Raf / MEK / ERK kinase cascade and leads to the activation of transcription factors such as ELK-1 and c-Jun. The transcription factor NF-AT is also activated by BCR ligation and contributes to the induction of genes such as the IL-2 gene. The tyrosine kinase Syk also contributes to BCR signaling, phosphorylating downstream targets including BLNK, PLCg, and the adaptor protein Vav. The tyrosine kinase Btk contributes to BCR signaling, as mutations in the human btk gene cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a disease in which the development of B cells is blocked at the pre-B cell stage. The adaptor protein Nck binds to the tyrosine phosphorylated BCR complex and may link BCR signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. The BCR also signals through the MAP kinase pathway, leading to the activation of the transcription factors ELK-1 and c-Jun. The serine / threonine kinase AKT also contributes to BCR signaling, phosphorylating the transcription factor FKHR-L1. The BCR activates a variety of signaling pathways, some of which are opposed by others. The balance of these opposing signals may determine the fate of the cell.",
  "HGF / SF is a multifunctional cytokine that stimulates cell motility, morphogenesis, and proliferation in a variety of cell types. The biological activities of HGF are mediated by the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. HGF binding to c-Met induces receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways including the MAPK pathway, PI-3 kinase pathway, and the Stat pathway. These signaling pathways ultimately regulate gene expression and cellular responses.",
  "Translation is the process of protein synthesis from a mRNA molecule. It begins with the binding of a methionine-containing initiation factor (usually eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF2) to the 4 0S ribosomal subunit. The binding of the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA) then occurs, and the 6 0S subunit joins to form the 4 8S initiation complex. The binding of a 6 0S subunit to this complex then leads to the hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2, releasing the factors and leaving the ribosome in the now-stable complex with an active site for elongation. The elongation cycle begins with the binding of a ternary complex to the ribosome, followed by GTP hydrolysis, and the release of the ternary complex. The next amino acid is then added, and the cycle repeats until the complete sequence of amino acids is reached.",
  "The allergic response is initiated by the interaction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) with allergens. The binding of allergen to IgE on the cell surface of mast cells and basophils leads to the activation of these cells and the release of inflammatory mediators. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by IgE and mast cells. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are characterized by the immediate release of mediators from mast cells and basophils and are associated with the symptoms of hives, itching, and edema. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are initiated by the crosslinking of high-affinity IgE receptors (FcERI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils by allergens. Crosslinking of IgE-FcERI complexes leads to the activation of signaling pathways that result in the release of preformed mediators from intracellular granules and the de novo synthesis and release of lipid mediators, cytokines, and chemokines. The activation of mast cells and basophils by allergens leads to the release of preformed mediators that cause the early symptoms of type I hypersensitivity reactions. The activation of mast cells and basophils also leads to the production and release of lipid mediators, cytokines, and chemokines that contribute to the late phase and the progression of the allergic response. The late phase response is characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, into tissues and the increased expression of adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium. The late phase of the allergic response is often associated with the symptoms of hives, itching, and edema. The late phase response is believed to be mediated by the same mediators that cause the immediate response, but in a delayed manner.",
  "The angiogenic process is a complex cascade of events that lead to the formation of new blood vessels. The angiogenic switch is a critical control point in the formation of new blood vessels and is regulated by a balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. The angiogenic factors include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and others. The angiogenic inhibitors include thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), angiostatin, and others. The angiogenic process is also regulated by hypoxia. The angiogenic factors stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. The angiogenic inhibitors inhibit these processes. The angiogenic factors are upregulated by hypoxia and by oncogenes. The angiogenic factors are produced by tumor cells and by cells in the tumor stroma, including fibroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells. The angiogenic factors are upregulated by hypoxia and by oncogenes. The angiogenic factors stimulate angiogenesis by binding to their receptors on endothelial cells. The VEGF receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor that signals through the ras / MAP kinase pathway to induce endothelial cell proliferation. The PDGF receptor is a tyrosine kinase and signals through the PI3 kinase pathway to induce endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The FGF receptor is a tyrosine kinase and signals through the ras / MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways to induce endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The angiogenic factors also induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the extracellular matrix and allow endothelial cell migration and tube formation. The angiogenic inhibitors inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration by binding to their receptors and blocking downstream signaling. The angiogenic factors are upregulated by hypoxia and by oncogenes. The angiogenic factors are upregulated by hypoxia and by oncogenes.

  "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which polarized epithelial cells undergo a transition to a more motile mesenchymal phenotype. This process occurs during embryonic development and is also involved in tissue regeneration and cancer progression. During EMT, epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-cell adhesion, and gain the ability to migrate and invade. The hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin expression and the subsequent translocation of beta-catenin from the cell membrane to the nucleus. The loss of E-cadherin expression is mediated by transcriptional repressors such as Snail, Slug and ZEB1. These transcriptional repressors bind to E-boxes in the E-cadherin promoter and recruit histone deacetylases and methylases to repress E-cadherin expression. The beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional coactivator with LEF / TCF family proteins to induce the expression of genes involved in cell motility and proliferation. Secreted factors such as TGF-beta and EGF induce EMT. TGF-beta induces EMT through the Smad pathway and also through the MAP kinase pathway. EGF induces EMT through the Ras / Rac / JNK pathway.",
  "The conversion of glucose to glycogen is a key metabolic pathway that is regulated by multiple enzymes. The first step of this pathway is the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase (HK) to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). G6P is then converted to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) by phosphoglucomutase (PGM), and finally to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI).

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated by binding of its ligand, epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). Binding of ligand to the receptor leads to receptor dimerization, activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, and autophosphorylation of the receptor and recruitment of signaling molecules to the activated receptor. These signaling molecules include the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK kinase cascade and the PI3 kinase / Akt pathway. These pathways ultimately result in changes in gene expression that promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Mutations in the EGFR gene or in genes that regulate its signaling have been identified in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). NSCLC that overexpress EGFR are more likely to respond to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib or erlotinib. Mutations in the EGFR gene are associated with a higher response rate to gefitinib or erlotinib.",
  "Cartilage is a specialized tissue that provides a favorable environment for the immobilization of the joints. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage consists primarily of collagen type II and proteoglycan aggregates of hyaluronan and link proteins. The chondrocytes are surrounded by a thin layer of type I collagen and are attached to each other by specialized cell-surface structures, the cell-matrix adhesions known as focal adhesions. These structures are primarily formed by integrins, heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that bind to the ECM proteins. The binding of ECM proteins to integrins activates several signaling pathways, including the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway and the RhoA-Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. These pathways regulate chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The amyloid beta peptide (A beta), a proteolytic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the major component of senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP is a type-1 integral membrane protein with a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. APP is cleaved by two different proteases, the beta-secretase and the gamma-secretase, to release A beta. The beta-secretase cleavage occurs in the extracellular domain of APP and liberates a soluble fragment, sA beta, and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment, C9 9. The gamma-secretase cleavage occurs within the membrane domain of C9 9 and releases A beta and a cytoplasmic fragment, APP intracellular domain. sA beta is the major component of senile plaques and is neurotoxic. The APP intracellular domain may also have a role in the pathogenesis of AD. The second cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase is thought to be involved in the regulation of the level of APP. The third cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase is the final step in the production of A beta. Mutations in APP or in presenilin-1 (PS-1), a component of the gamma-secretase complex, cause early-onset familial AD (FAD).

  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled cellular suicide mechanism that removes damaged or unwanted cells. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL promote cell survival, whereas Bax and Bad promote apoptosis. Bad is phosphorylated by AKT, which leads to its inactivation and retention in the cytosol. Bad interacts with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 to block their anti-apoptotic function. When dephosphorylated, Bad interacts with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 to induce apoptosis. The activity of Bax and Bid are regulated by phosphorylation / dephosphorylation. Bax is phosphorylated by AKT and this phosphorylation inhibits its pro-apoptotic activity. Bid is dephosphorylated by a protease activated during apoptosis, and this promotes its pro-apoptotic activity. Other Bcl-2 family members are not regulated by phosphorylation.

  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved system that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability. MMR corrects DNA mismatches generated during replication and prevents mutations from becoming permanent in the genome. Defects in MMR are associated with genome-wide increases in mutation rates and predisposition to cancer. In Escherichia coli, MMR is initiated by the mismatch-activated MutS-MutL-ATP complex. This complex recruits and activates the MutH endonuclease, which nicks the unmethylated daughter strand at a hemimethylated GATC sequence. The nick in the unmethylated strand is then used as a signal to direct excision of the error-containing DNA strand by the UvrD, MutH, and exonuclease I proteins. DNA polymerase III and DNA ligase then resynthesize the repaired DNA molecule. In bacteria like E. coli, MMR is essential for viability. In humans, MMR is not essential, but defects in MMR are associated with genome-wide instability and predisposition to cancer. Human MMR proteins are highly conserved with E. coli MutS and MutL homologs. Human MMR proteins are similar in function and mechanism to their E. coli counterparts.",

IFN-gamma plays an important role in the activation of macrophages and the induction of apoptosis in virus-infected cells.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multi-subunit complex that is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens by T cells. The TCR is composed of two chains that are non-covalently associated: the clonotypic alpha or beta chain and the more ubiquitously expressed gamma or delta chain. The TCR-CD3 complex is expressed on the cell surface in three different forms: the TCR-CD3 complex is expressed on the surface of all T cells, the TCR-CD3 complex is expressed on the surface of all T cells, and the TCR-CD3 complex is not expressed on the cell surface. The TCR-CD3 complex is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens by T cells and is essential for T cell activation. The clonotypic alpha or beta chain is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens by T cells and is encoded by the TCRA2 or TRBC2 genes, respectively. The gamma and delta chains are encoded by the TRGC2 or TRDP2 genes, respectively. The expression of the gamma and delta chains is mutually exclusive and the expression of the gamma and delta chains is required for the expression of a complete TCR-CD3 complex on the cell surface. The expression of the gamma and delta chains is also required for the formation of a complete TCR complex. The expression of the gamma and delta chains is induced by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-2, respectively. The activation of T cells by antigen results in the expression of the clonotypic alpha or beta chain and the formation of a complete TCR-CD3 complex. The activation of T cells also results in the induction of the expression of the gamma and delta chains and the formation of a complete TCR-CD3 complex that is not expressed on the cell surface. The expression of the gamma and delta chains is required for the formation of a complete TCR-CD3 complex and is induced by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-2.",
  "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to both clinical features and molecular pathogenesis. The molecular basis of AML is complex and heterogeneous, involving several classes of genetic alterations. These include mutations in transcription factors such as those in the RUNX1, PML, and GATA families, as well as NPM1 and c-KIT. In addition, mutations in signaling genes such as FLT3, RAS, and c-KIT, as well as in the tumor suppressor genes TP5 3 and WT1, have been identified. Mutations in NPM1 and FLT3 are associated with a normal karyotype, whereas other mutations are associated with an aberrant karyotype. The prognostic impact of these molecular abnormalities is being defined.",
  "The coagulation cascade is a series of enzymatic reactions that result in the formation of thrombin, the final enzyme in the cascade, which ultimately leads to clot formation. The cascade begins with the activation of prothrombin by the tissue factor / factor VIIa complex. Thrombin then cleaves and activates factors V, VIII, and XIII, which leads to clot formation.

  "The cell cycle is a series of events that result in the duplication and segregation of chromosomes. The G1-S phase transition is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. At this point, cells are committed to enter S phase and prepare for DNA replication. Cyclin E-Cdk2 is a key regulator of the G1-S transition. Cyclin E-Cdk2 is activated at the G1-S transition and is required for cells to enter S phase. The activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 is inhibited by the Cdk inhibitors p2 1 Cip1 and p2 7 Kip1. The activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 is also inhibited by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cyclin E, which is triggered by phosphorylation of cyclin E. The activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 is also inhibited by association with the Cdk inhibitor p15Ink4b. The activity of p15Ink4b is inhibited by phosphorylation by the p27 kinase. The p15Ink4b protein is also regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cyclin E is triggered by p27-dependent phosphorylation of p15Ink4b. The p15Ink4b protein is also regulated by transcriptional repression. The E2F transcription factors are required for the expression of cyclin E and p15Ink4b. The E2F-Rb complex represses the transcription of cyclin E and p15Ink4b. The activity of the E2F-Rb complex is regulated by the phosphorylation state of Rb. The p27 kinase is inhibited by p15Ink4b and activated by cyclin E-Cdk2.",
  "The nucleolus is a nuclear subcompartment involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes. The nucleolus is also involved in the maturation of other noncoding RNAs, including the U3 and U6 spliceosomal RNAs, the telomerase RNA, and the RNase P RNA. The U3 snoRNA is required for the processing of 1 8S rRNA and the U3 RNA is required for the processing of both the 5. 8S and 2 8S rRNAs. The U3 snoRNA is associated with fibrillarin, a protein component of the box C / D snoRNPs involved in rRNA processing. The fibrillarin protein is also associated with the Sm proteins that form the core of spliceosomal snRNPs involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The association of fibrillarin with the U3 snoRNA and the Sm proteins suggests that the U3 snoRNP may be involved in the processing of both rRNA and snRNA. The mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK1 4) is associated with the U3 snoRNP and is required for the processing of both rRNA and snRNA. The phosphorylation of MAPK1 4 by the upstream kinase MEK3 may be involved in the regulation of U3 snoRNP activity.",
  "Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize extracellular material and plasma membrane proteins into intracellular vesicles. The process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) begins with the recruitment of clathrin to the plasma membrane, followed by the assembly of a protein coat that deforms the membrane and pinches off to form a clathrin-coated vesicle. The clathrin coat is then removed and recycled by the action of the GTPase dynamin. The adaptor protein complex AP2 plays a key role in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. AP2 is a heterotetramer consisting of two large subunits (alpha and beta2), a medium subunit (AP2M1 or AP2M2) and a smaller subunit (AP2S1 or AP2S2). AP2 binds to clathrin and the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins that are to be internalized. The medium subunit AP2M1 also binds to phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid that is concentrated in the plasma membrane. The interaction of AP2 with PIP2 and clathrin is regulated by the action of the GTPase dynamin. The GTPase activity of dynamin is stimulated by the adaptor protein ARH, which also binds to clathrin and AP2. The interaction of AP2 with clathrin and PIP2 is also regulated by phosphorylation of AP2M1 by protein kinase C. Once the vesicle is formed, it is uncoated and the components are recycled back to the plasma membrane. The adaptor protein complex AP-2 also plays a key role in the sorting of transmembrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles. The adaptor protein complex AP-1 sorts transmembrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The adaptor protein complex AP-3 is involved in the sorting of transmembrane proteins into vesicles that are targeted to the lysosome / vacuole.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly regulated process that ensures that the genome is replicated only once per cell cycle. The transition from G1 to S phase is regulated by the activity of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), which are activated by binding to cyclins and inhibited by CDK inhibitors. The activity of the CDKs is further regulated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the cyclins. The F-box protein Skp2 is a component of an SCF ubiquitin ligase that targets the CDK inhibitors for degradation. The transcription factor E2F-1 also regulates the expression of Skp2, creating a positive feedback loop that promotes the degradation of CDK inhibitors and the progression from G1 to S phase. The degradation of CDK inhibitors is also regulated by the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8. The activity of Nedd8 is required for the degradation of the CDK inhibitors and the progression from G1 to S phase. The activity of Nedd8 is regulated by the COP9 signalosome, a multi-subunit complex that also contains a metalloprotease activity. The COP9 signalosome is required for the degradation of CDK inhibitors and the progression from G1 to S phase.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly conserved sequence of events that takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and that includes the G1, S, G2 and M phases. The G1 phase is a period of growth and preparation for DNA replication. The S phase is devoted to the duplication of the genome. The G2 phase is a period of rapid preparation for mitosis. The M phase is the phase of cell division during which the chromosomes are separated and separated for segregation to daughter cells. The transition from one phase to another is regulated by the coordinated activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK activity is regulated by the association with cyclins and by the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDKs. The activity of CDKs is inhibited by the CDK inhibitors (CKIs), which include p27 KIP1, p15 INK4b, p16 INK4a, p18 INK4c and p19 INK4d. The activity of CDKs is also regulated by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), which include p19 ARF, p16 INK4a, p15 INK4b, p14 CKIGs and p73 KIP2 1. The p16 INK4a, p15 INK4b, p14 CKIGs and p73 KIP2 1 genes are encoded in the genome and are induced by various stimuli, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and activated oncogenes. These CDKIs bind to CDKs and inhibit their kinase activity. The p27 KIP1 and p15 INK4b proteins are induced during the G1 phase and inhibit the formation of cyclin D-CDK complexes. The p18 INK4c and p19 INK4d proteins are induced during the S and G2 phases and inhibit the formation of cyclin A-CDK and cyclin B-CDK complexes.",
  "WASP is a key regulator of actin polymerization in response to signals from the Rho family of GTPases. The Rho family GTPases regulate actin polymerization through the WASP-Arp2 / 3 complex. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a key regulator of actin polymerization and is activated by the WASP protein. The Arp2 / 3 complex consists of three proteins, Arp2, Arp3 and a new family of proteins, the WASP-related proteins. The WASP-related proteins are WASP, N-WASP, WAVE / Scar, and JMY. The WASP-related proteins are involved in actin polymerization in response to signals from the Rac family of GTPases. The WASP-related proteins are not involved in Arp2 / 3 activation, but rather act as a scaffold for other proteins involved in actin polymerization. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a key regulator of actin polymerization and is activated by the WASP protein. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a seven protein complex that binds to the side of an actin filament and creates a new end for the addition of actin monomers. The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by the WASP protein through a series of conformational changes in WASP. The Arp2 / 3 complex is inactive in the absence of WASP and activation requires binding of WASP to the Arp2 / 3 complex. The activation of WASP by the Rho family GTPases Cdc4 2 and Rac stimulates actin polymerization and changes in cell shape. The activation of WASP by Cdc4 2 and Rac stimulates actin polymerization and changes in cell shape. The activation of WASP by Cdc4 2 and Rac stimulates actin polymerization and changes in cell shape.

  "Neurotrophins are a family of neurotrophic factors that promote neuronal survival and differentiation. Neurotrophins exert their functions through two classes of receptors, Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the p75 neurotrophin receptor. Neurotrophin signaling is initiated by Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, which are activated by neurotrophins to form homodimers. The activated Trk receptors recruit various signaling molecules to the plasma membrane, including Shc, FRS2, and IRS. These signaling complexes activate the Ras-MAPK pathway and the PI-3 kinase pathway. The PI-3 kinase pathway leads to the activation of Akt and the serum response pathway. The Ras-MAPK pathway leads to the induction of immediate early genes, such as c-fos and NGFI-A, which in turn activate the transcription factors such as CREB and ELK-1. These transcription factors regulate the expression of genes involved in neuronal survival and differentiation.",
  "The coagulation cascade is a series of enzymatic reactions that lead to the formation of thrombin, the enzyme that converts fibrinogen to fibrin. The intrinsic pathway of coagulation is initiated by activation of the contact system, a three-step proteolytic cascade that results in the activation of prekallikrein and factor XII. The contact system is initiated by negatively charged surfaces, such as those found in damaged endothelium. The first step is the activation of prekallikrein by high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK). Factor XII is activated by kallikrein in the presence of negatively charged surfaces. The kallikrein-kinin system is a proteolytic cascade initiated by the kallikrein-mediated release of bradykinin from high-molecular-weight kininogen. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator and has a number of other effects. The intrinsic pathway is inhibited by C1 inhibitor. The intrinsic pathway is also inhibited by antithrombin III, protein C and protein S. Activated protein C (APC) inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, the two cofactors for the factor Xa-prothrombin complex. Protein S, a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein, enhances the APC-mediated inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa. Protein C is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex.",
  "The cell cycle is a series of events that result in the duplication of chromosomes and the formation of two daughter cells. Checkpoints are control mechanisms that ensure the proper order of the cell cycle and prevent the cell cycle from progressing until all the components have been prepared. The DNA damage checkpoint is a checkpoint that blocks the cell cycle progression in G2 phase until the DNA has been repaired. The ATM kinase is a key component of the DNA damage checkpoint. It is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates the chk1 kinase. The chk1 kinase then phosphorylates cdc2 5C, which dephosphorylates and activates the cdc2 / cyclin B kinase that drives the cell into mitosis. The p53 tumor suppressor also plays a role in the DNA damage checkpoint. The p53 protein is a transcription factor that is stabilized and activated by DNA damage. The p53 protein activates the expression of the p21CIP1 gene, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The p53 protein also activates the expression of the p16 gene, which encodes another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The p19 gene encodes a protein that interacts with the ATR kinase and activates the DNA damage checkpoint. The p53 protein is also involved in the G1 / S checkpoint that prevents the cell cycle from progressing into S phase when the replication of DNA is damaged. The p53 protein interacts with MDM2 to activate the p21CIP1 gene and block the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase.",
  "Hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension, which is found in many diseases, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and cancer. In addition to causing tissue damage, hypoxia induces angiogenesis, a process that is essential for the growth and metastasis of tumors. The cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that is a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha subunit (HIF-1alpha) and a beta subunit (HIF-1beta). In the presence of oxygen, HIF-1alpha is hydroxylated by oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), leading to its rapid ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In hypoxia, HIF-1alpha is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with HIF-1beta and activates transcription of target genes by binding to a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE). HIF-1 induces the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), erythropoiesis (EPO), anaerobic metabolism (glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes), and cell survival (NIX, Bcl2 / adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3). HIF-1 is also involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and inflammation. HIF-1 activity is regulated by a variety of factors, including growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and oxygen tension. HIF-1 activity is also regulated at the post-translational level by the tumor suppressor gene product, p53. Under normal conditions, HIF-1alpha is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, with a half-life of less than 1 5 seconds. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is the recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets HIF-1alpha for ubiquitination and degradation. The binding of HIF-1alpha to VHL is oxygen-dependent, and is mediated by the hydroxylation of two prolines (P4 0 2 and P5 6 4) by PHDs. In addition to VHL, HIF-1alpha is also targeted for degradation by the proteasome in an oxygen-independent manner by the factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1). FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that blocks the interaction of HIF-1 with transcriptional coactivators by hydroxylating an asparagine residue (N8 0 3) in the HIF-1alpha transactivation domain. Hypoxia blocks the hydroxylation of N8 0 3 by FIH-1, thereby preventing the interaction of HIF-1 with transcriptional coactivators and increasing HIF-1 transcriptional activity. HIF-1 is also regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53. Under hypoxic conditions, p53 is induced and interacts with HIF-1alpha, blocking the interaction of HIF-1alpha with VHL and promoting HIF-1alpha stabilization. In addition to blocking HIF-1 activity, p53 also activates transcription of genes that mediate apoptosis.",
  "Progesterone (Pg) is a steroid hormone that regulates a variety of physiological processes, including female reproduction, mammary gland development, and bone formation. The biological actions of Pg are mediated by two intracellular receptors, PR-A and PR-B. Both receptors are members of the steroid hormone receptor gene family and share similar structures, including a N-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Pg binds to the receptor with high affinity and the PR-Pg complex is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences, termed progesterone response elements (PREs), located in the regulatory regions of Pg-regulated genes. The binding of Pg to PR induces a conformational change in the receptor that allows the receptor to interact with other transcription factors and coactivators, such as CBP / pCIP and p160, and to recruit the transcriptional machinery to the target genes. The interaction of PR with coregulators is a key regulatory step in the transcriptional activity of PR. In the absence of Pg, PR-B is associated with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and is transcriptionally inactive. Binding of Pg to PR induces a conformational change in the receptor that leads to the release of the HDACs and the recruitment of coactivators, including CBP / p160, and the histone acetylase (HAT) activity of coactivators to the PR-regulated promoters. The coactivators CBP and p160 possess histone acetylase activity and are involved in chromatin remodeling, allowing the binding of the transcription machinery to the promoter and the subsequent initiation of transcription. The activity of PR is also regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of PR by MAPK induces a conformational change in the receptor that increases the receptor's affinity for Pg and its ability to activate transcription. In addition, MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of PR-B at Ser-2 9 4 also increases the stability of the receptor.",
  "The p170 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) is a family of kinases activated by the Ras-MAPK pathway. The four RSK isoforms (I, II, III, and IV) are differentially expressed in tissues and are encoded by separate genes. The RSKs have two functional kinase domains, both of which are required for activation. The N-terminal kinase domain phosphorylates the C-terminal kinase domain, and the activation of the C-terminal kinase domain requires the phosphorylation of two key residues, Thr5 7 3 and Ser3 8 0. The N-terminal kinase domain phosphorylates the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and other transcription factors. The C-terminal kinase domain phosphorylates additional substrates, including: I kappa B, histone H3, and the p65 protein. The activation of the RSKs is mediated by the MAPK pathway, which also leads to the activation of the MSK-1 and -2 kinases. The MSKs phosphorylate CREB and histone H3, but do not activate other RSK substrates. The RSKs are involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to growth and stress signals, and may play a role in chromatin remodeling.",
  "The immune system responds to foreign pathogens by activating a variety of cells, including macrophages and B cells. Macrophages phagocytose foreign pathogens and present their antigens to T cells. B cells produce antibodies that bind and inactivate the pathogen. Macrophages and B cells express complement receptors, which bind the complement protein C3b to phagocytose foreign pathogens. B cells also express complement receptors that bind the complement protein C4b to present antigens to T cells. B cells also express the CD4 0 receptor, which binds the B cell costimulatory protein CD4 0L expressed by activated T cells. The interaction of CD4 0 and CD4 0L activates B cells to proliferate and produce antibodies. Complement receptors also interact with the Fc portion of antibodies to activate macrophages and B cells. Macrophages and B cells also express the Fc gamma receptor IIb (CD16), which binds the Fc portion of antibodies to activate macrophages and B cells. The Fc gamma receptor IIb is a member of the immunoglobulin gene family, but it does not bind the antigen in the same way that other immunoglobulin family members do. The Fc gamma receptor IIb is also known as CD19 and is expressed by B cells, macrophages, and NK cells. The Fc gamma receptor IIb is a heterodimer, with one chain that binds the Fc portion of antibodies and another chain that transduces the activation signal. The Fc gamma receptor IIb is also known as CD19-2. The Fc gamma receptor IIb is a member of a gene family that also includes the Fc gamma receptor I (CD16) and the Fc epsilon RI (CD13). The Fc gamma receptor IIb is expressed on the surface of B cells, macrophages, and NK cells. The Fc gamma receptor IIb transmits an activation signal through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. The Fc gamma receptor IIb transmits an activation signal when bound by antibodies, but it does not transmit an inhibitory signal when bound by complement proteins.",
  "Insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of type II diabetes. Insulin resistance is associated with a decrease in the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue. This defect in insulin action is associated with a compensatory increase in the secretion of insulin by the beta-cells of the pancreas. The increased insulin secretion by the beta-cells is unable to maintain normal blood glucose levels because of the insulin resistance of the muscle and adipose tissue. The molecular basis of insulin resistance is not known, but may be related to a genetic predisposition to develop the disease. The molecular mechanisms that lead from insulin resistance to type II diabetes are not known, but may involve increased secretion of the beta-cell hormone, glucagon, and / or impaired ability of the liver to respond to the increased insulin levels. The increased secretion of glucagon may be caused by a decrease in the ability of insulin to suppress the secretion of the pancreatic hormone, somatostatin. The ability of insulin to suppress glucagon secretion is thought to be mediated by the ability of insulin to suppress the secretion of the gut hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). The ability of insulin to suppress glucagon secretion is thought to be mediated by the ability of insulin to suppress the secretion of the gut hormone, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). Insulin resistance is associated with a compensatory increase in the secretion of insulin by the beta-cells. The increased insulin secretion by the beta-cells is unable to maintain normal blood glucose levels because of the insulin resistance of the muscle and adipose tissue. The increased insulin secretion by the beta-cells may be caused by a genetic predisposition to develop type II diabetes. The molecular basis of insulin resistance is not known, but may be related to a genetic predisposition to develop the disease. The molecular mechanisms that lead from insulin resistance to type II diabetes are not known, but may be related to the ability of insulin resistance to cause increased levels of free fatty acids (FFA). Increased levels of FFA are associated with insulin resistance and type II diabetes. The increased levels of FFA may cause insulin resistance by at least two different mechanisms. One mechanism is that FFA can inhibit the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface, thereby blocking the uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissue. Another mechanism is that FFA can activate protein kinase C, which can then phosphorylate IRS-1 and inhibit insulin signaling. Increased FFA levels may also cause insulin resistance by increasing oxidative stress. Increased levels of FFA can lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS may inactivate protein tyrosine phosphatases, thereby preventing dephosphorylation of IRS-1 and blocking insulin signaling.",
  "Interleukin-1 2 (IL-1 2) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the cellular immune response. IL-1 2 is produced by macrophages in response to bacterial infection and stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of T cells. The activity of IL-1 2 is regulated by the production of a soluble receptor that binds IL-1 2 and prevents it from interacting with the cellular receptor. The soluble receptor is produced by proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface IL-1 2 receptor and is found in serum at high concentrations in patients with inflammatory conditions. The soluble receptor blocks IL-1 2 activity by binding the cytokine and preventing it from interacting with the cellular receptor. The soluble receptor is also a competitive inhibitor of the cellular receptor and blocks the activity of IL-1 2 at low concentrations of IL-1 2 but does not block the activity of other cytokines that signal through the JAK / STAT pathway. The activity of the soluble receptor is specific for IL-1 2 and does not block the activity of other cytokines. The IL-1 2 receptor is a heterodimer of two chains, one of which is specific for IL-1 2. Binding of IL-1 2 to the cellular receptor activates JAK kinases and STAT transcription factors that lead to the expression of genes involved in the cellular immune response. The soluble receptor blocks the activation of JAK kinases and STAT transcription factors by IL-1 2 and blocks the cellular immune response.

  "The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a multimeric receptor that is essential for the development and function of B cells. The BCR is a complex of immunoglobulin (Ig) and Ig-associated proteins. The Ig component of the BCR is responsible for antigen recognition and the Ig-associated proteins are involved in signal transduction. The Ig-associated proteins include CD7 9a and CD7 9b. The cytoplasmic domains of these proteins contain multiple tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated upon BCR engagement by antigen. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for proteins that initiate downstream signaling pathways. The tyrosine kinase Syk is recruited to the phosphorylated BCR complex through its association with the phosphorylated tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domains of CD7 9a and CD7 9b. The binding of Syk to the BCR activates Syk and initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of transcription factors and other cellular processes. The activation of the transcription factor NF-AT is one of the earliest events in BCR signaling and is required for the expression of genes involved in B cell activation and differentiation. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is also an early event in BCR signaling and is required for the activation of NF-AT and other transcription factors. The activation of the transcription factor AP-1 is also an early event in BCR signaling and is required for the expression of genes involved in B cell activation and differentiation. The BCR activates multiple protein kinases in the MAPK pathway including the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk, the small GTPases Rac and Ras, and the protein kinase C isoforms alpha and beta. The activation of these kinases leads to the activation of the MAPKs Erk, JNK and p3 8. The activation of these kinases by the BCR is required for the activation of NF-AT, AP-1 and other transcription factors involved in B cell activation and differentiation.",
  "The transcription factor NF-kB is a key regulator of immune and inflammatory responses. The RELA subunit of NF-kB is activated by phosphorylation of the serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of the RELA protein. The phosphorylation of RELA is mediated by the MAP kinase pathways and the PI3 kinase pathway. The PI3 kinase pathway is activated by a variety of stimuli including LPS, IL-1, TNF, and antigen receptors. The PI3 kinase pathway activates the AKT kinase which phosphorylates and inactivates the IkB kinase. IkB kinase phosphorylates IkB, targeting it for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. The degradation of IkB releases NF-kB to the nucleus, where it activates transcription. The activation of NF-kB by the PI3 kinase pathway is required for the induction of the immune response by a variety of stimuli. The activation of NF-kB by the MAP kinase pathways is involved in the inflammatory response and is involved in the response to stress stimuli such as heat shock and UV light. The activation of NF-kB by the MAP kinase pathways is also involved in the response to stress stimuli. The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are a group of kinases that are activated by stress stimuli such as UV and osmotic shock. The SAPKs are related to the MAP kinases in that they are activated by phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in response to stress stimuli. The activation of the SAPKs by stress stimuli is mediated by the MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3). The activation of the SAPKs by stress stimuli is involved in the regulation of genes involved in the stress response such as the heat shock genes. The activation of NF-kB by the stress stimuli is involved in the regulation of genes involved in the inflammatory response. The activation of NF-kB by the stress stimuli is involved in the regulation of genes involved in the apoptotic response. The activation of NF-kB by the stress stimuli is involved in the regulation of genes involved in the apoptotic response such as fas and trail.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a highly conserved signaling cascade that is involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival. The pathway is activated by a variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines and cellular stress. The first step in the pathway is the activation of a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. This leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein Shc and the Grb-2 / Sos-1 complex to the receptor. Sos-1 activates Ras, a G-protein that regulates the Raf kinase cascade. The next kinases in the cascade are the Map kinases, including Erk1 and Erk2. The Map kinases activate a variety of substrates, including transcription factors that regulate gene expression.",
  "Macrophages are tissue-resident phagocytic cells that are involved in the innate immune response to microbial infection. Macrophages are activated by microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and by cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and microorganisms and present them to T cells, inducing the activation of T cells. Macrophages produce a variety of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The production of these mediators is induced by LPS and IFN-gamma through the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). The activation of macrophages by microbial products and cytokines is important for the elimination of invading microorganisms and the elimination of harmful stimuli.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of secreted signaling factors plays critical roles in development and disease. The TGF-beta family includes TGF-betas, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These factors signal through serine-threonine kinase receptors and the SMAD family of transcription factors. In the canonical TGF-beta signaling pathway, ligand binding leads to phosphorylation and activation of the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates and activates the type II receptor. The activated type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the receptor-activated SMADs (R-SMADs), SMAD2 and SMAD3. The R-SMADs are in turn bound by the co-mediator SMAD, SMAD4, and the complex is then translocated to the nucleus, where it associates with other transcription factors and regulates transcription. Inhibitory SMADs, SMAD6 and SMAD7, act as antagonists of this pathway and are induced by TGF-beta family members to block signaling. The BMP signaling pathway is distinct from the TGF-beta pathway in that they activate SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8. BMPs bind to their receptors and activate SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8. Inhibitory SMADs, SMAD6 and SMAD7, act as antagonists of this pathway and are induced by BMPs to block signaling.",
  "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The majority of CRC are sporadic and the remaining cases are part of a hereditary cancer syndrome. The hereditary CRC syndromes include familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), and MYH-associated polyposis (MAP). The APC gene is mutated in most cases of sporadic CRC. The APC protein is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in the development of CRC. The hallmark of FAP is the development of hundreds of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. The APC gene is mutated in most cases of FAP. MYH is involved in base excision repair and mutations in this gene are found in a small subset of patients with MAP.",
  "The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) is a novel pathway that regulates inflammation. Acetylcholine (ACh), the main neurotransmitter in the vagus nerve, is released from neurons in the vagus nerve and activates macrophages through the alpha7 nicotinic ACh receptor (alpha7nAChR). Activation of alpha7nAChR on macrophages inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. The CAP pathway is distinct from the cholinergic regulation of the heart rate and the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycle. The CAP pathway also differs from the cholinergic anti-tumor response (CAR) pathway, which is activated by the vagus nerve and inhibits tumor growth. The CAP pathway may be a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and asthma.",
  "Olfactory receptors (ORs) are a large gene family in mammals that are expressed in specialized sensory neurons in the nose. ORs are G-protein coupled receptors that bind odorants and activate second messenger pathways to generate electrical signals in the olfactory nerve. The axons of the receptor neurons project to the olfactory bulb where they synapse with mitral and tufted cells. The activity of the olfactory system is essential for the detection and discrimination of a large variety of odorants.",
  "The heart responds to increased hemodynamic load by increasing the size of the ventricular chambers and by increasing the force of contraction. The former is accomplished by increasing the size of individual cardiomyocytes (hypertrophy), while the latter is accomplished by increasing the force of contraction of individual cardiomyocytes (hypertropic growth). The signaling pathways that regulate these two processes are distinct. Hypertrophy is initially a compensatory response that allows the heart to increase its pumping capacity, but which can progress to heart failure if the stress stimulus is sustained. Hypertrophy is accompanied by changes in gene expression, including increased expression of genes encoding for fetal proteins, such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), and decreased expression of genes encoding for adult proteins, such as alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca (2 +) -ATPase (SERCA). Hypertrophy is also accompanied by changes in the extracellular matrix, including increased expression of collagen and fibronectin, and decreased expression of the extracellular matrix protein, elastin. The signaling pathways that regulate these changes in gene expression and the extracellular matrix are distinct from those that regulate cardiomyocyte growth. The signaling pathways that regulate hypertrophy are activated by a variety of stimuli, including increased hemodynamic load, cytokines, and hormones. The signaling pathways that regulate cardiomyocyte growth are also distinct from those that regulate other aspects of cardiac function, such as excitation-contraction coupling.

  "The G2 / M DNA damage checkpoint prevents cells from entering mitosis if the genome is damaged. The G2 / M DNA damage checkpoint is activated by DNA damage that occurs during G2 phase of the cell cycle. The ATM kinase is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. The activated Chk1 and Chk2 kinases then phosphorylate and inhibit the Cdc2 5C phosphatase, which normally dephosphorylates and activates the Cdc2 / cyclin B kinase that drives cells into mitosis. The p21WAF1 / CIP1 protein is also induced by the ATM / ATR kinases and inhibits the Cdc2 5C phosphatase, further contributing to the inhibition of Cdc2 / cyclin B. The p27KIP1 protein is induced by the p53 tumor suppressor and inhibits the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. The p53 and p21 proteins induce the expression of the 1 4-3-3sigma protein, which binds to and inhibits the Cdc2 5C phosphatase, further contributing to the inhibition of mitosis.",
  "The integrin alpha4beta1 heterodimer is a receptor for the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Interaction of fibronectin with the alpha4beta1 integrin stimulates cell migration. The interaction of fibronectin with the alpha4beta1 integrin also stimulates cell survival. The interaction of fibronectin with the alpha4beta1 integrin stimulates the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase / AKT pathway. The activation of the AKT pathway stimulates cell survival.

  "The Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway plays a key role in the regulation of cellular defenses against oxidative stress and toxic chemicals. Nrf2 is a basic-region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the regulatory regions of phase II detoxification and antioxidant genes. Keap1 is an actin-associated cytoplasmic protein that negatively regulates Nrf2 by holding it in an inactive state. Exposure to oxidative stress or chemical inducers causes modification of Keap1, which in turn leads to Nrf2 activation. Activated Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with a small Maf protein to activate transcription. Nrf2 target genes include glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), NAD (P) H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), UDP-glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs), glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), and many others. Activation of these genes increases cellular defenses against oxidative stress and toxic chemicals.",
  "Rac proteins are members of the Rho family of GTPases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and are involved in cell motility, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation. The Rac proteins are activated by GEFs, which are stimulated by growth factor receptors and the Dbl family of oncogenes. The Dbl family of oncogenes includes the Dbl, Vav, Vav-2, and Trio proteins. The Dbl family of GEFs is characterized by a DH domain that is required for GEF activity and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is involved in membrane localization. The Dbl family GEFs are regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including the relief of an inhibitory interaction between the Dbl PH domain and the DH domain. The Dbl family GEFs are further regulated by additional domains that provide additional levels of regulation. One of the key regulators of Rac is the DBL-related (DBL) family of GEFs. The DBL family GEFs are characterized by the presence of a DBL homology (DH) domain and a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DBL family GEFs are activated by the Dbl-homology (DH) domain, which is stimulated by the Pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain. The DBL family GEFs are further regulated by additional domains that provide additional levels of regulation. One of the key regulators of Rac is the Vav proteins. The Vav proteins are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation by the Tec kinases and the subsequent relief of an intramolecular inhibition by the PH domain. The Vav proteins are further regulated by an additional domain that contains a cysteine-rich region that is predicted to bind lipid ligands. The activation of Rac by the Vav proteins is further regulated by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity of the nullo protein. The nullo protein is a Rac-specific GAP that is activated by Rac-GTP and stimulates the hydrolysis of Rac-GTP to Rac-GDP. The activation of Rac by the DBL family GEFs and the subsequent inactivation of Rac by the GAPs provides a mechanism for the transient activation of Rac. The transient activation of Rac by the GEFs and GAPs provides a mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of Rac. The spatial regulation of Rac is mediated by the localization of the GEFs and GAPs to specific subcellular locations. The localization of the GEFs and GAPs to specific subcellular locations provides a mechanism for the spatial regulation of Rac. The localization of the GEFs and GAPs to specific subcellular locations also provides a mechanism for the temporal regulation of Rac. The localization of the GEFs and GAPs to specific subcellular locations provides a mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of Rac.",
  "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and are involved in a variety of biological processes including development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. BMPs are covalently bound to their propeptides and are cleaved to release the mature form. The mature form binds to two different types of transmembrane serine / threonine kinase receptors, the type II and type I receptors. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor. Type I receptor phosphorylates downstream signaling molecules, the receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads). Activated R-Smads associate with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and the heteromeric complex then translocates into the nucleus. There, the complex activates the transcription of target genes by interacting with specific transcription factors. Smad6 and Smad7 are inhibitory Smads that inhibit the signaling of R-Smads.",
  "The complement system is an important part of the innate immune system. It is activated by the presence of pathogens and leads to the lysis of the pathogen and the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection. The complement system is comprised of more than thirty proteins that are divided into three pathways. The classical pathway is initiated by the recognition of pathogens by antibodies bound to the surface of the cell. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens by the mannose-binding lectin (MBL). The alternative pathway is initiated by spontaneous activation of C3, which is continuously cleaved by factor D and factor B. The three pathways converge in the cleavage of C3 and C5 to form the C3 convertase, which cleaves and activates the downstream components. The C3 convertase cleaves and activates additional C3 molecules, forming the C5 convertase. The C5 convertase cleaves and activates the components of the terminal pathway, which leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The formation of the MAC lyses the cell membrane and can lead to the death of the cell. The three pathways converge in the formation of the C3 convertase, which cleaves and activates the C5 convertase. The formation of the MAC is the final step in all three pathways. The classical pathway is initiated by the recognition of pathogens by antibodies bound to the cell surface. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens by the mannose-binding lectin (MBL). The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous activation of C3, which continuously cleaves and activates the C3 convertase.

The complement system is tightly regulated by a group of proteins called complement regulators. The complement system is activated by the presence of pathogens and is then quickly turned off once the infection is cleared. The complement system is activated by three different pathways, but all three converge in the cleavage of C3. The classical pathway is initiated by the recognition of pathogens by antibodies bound to the cell surface. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens by the mannose-binding lectin (MBL).

The complement system is tightly regulated by a group of proteins called complement regulators. The complement regulators include C1 inhibitor, factor H, factor I, clusterin, and C4b-binding protein. The C1 inhibitor inhibits the activation of the classical and lectin pathways. Factor H and factor I regulate the alternative pathway. Factor H promotes the cleavage of C3b by factor I and inhibits the formation of the C3 convertase. Factor I cleaves and inactivates the complement factors C3b and C4b. The complement system is also activated by the recognition of pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The recognition of pathogens by TLRs leads to the cleavage of complement factor C3 and the formation of the C3 convertase.

  "The Krebs cycle is a central metabolic pathway that produces NADH and FADH2 for use in the electron transport chain and ATP production. The cycle begins with the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. Oxaloacetate is then converted to acetyl-CoA by the action of citrate synthase. Acetyl-CoA is oxidized to form two molecules of NADH and two molecules of succinyl-CoA. The two molecules of succinyl-CoA are converted to two molecules of fumarate by the enzyme fumarate hydratase. Fumarate is then reduced to malate by the enzyme malate dehydrogenase. The enzyme citrate synthase condenses oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to form citrate. The cycle ends with the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to form alpha-ketoglutarate, which is then converted to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Succinyl-CoA is then condensed with a molecule of acetyl-CoA to form two molecules of malate. The enzyme malate synthase condenses malate and acetyl-CoA to form one molecule of pyruvate. The cycle is complete when two molecules of each of the compounds above are oxidized to produce two molecules of CO2. The Krebs cycle is not a single cycle, but a series of eight reactions that occur in the mitochondrial matrix. Each reaction in the cycle requires a different enzyme. Key words: Krebs cycle, NADH, FADH2, NADH, FADH2, electron transport, electron transport, pyruvate carboxylase, citrate synthase, acetyl-CoA, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, fumarate, succinate, malic enzyme, malic enzyme, malic enzyme 1, malic enzyme 2, malic enzyme 3, malic enzyme 4.",
  "Cardiac muscle contraction is triggered by a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration ([Ca2 +] i), which is caused by Ca2 + influx through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2 + channels (LCCs) in the plasma membrane and Ca2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors, RyRs). The Ca2 + influx through LCCs is mainly responsible for the initial rapid increase in [Ca2 +] i, which is called the Ca2 + transient, followed by a Ca2 + influx from the extracellular space, which is called the Ca2 + transient. The Ca2 + influx from the extracellular space is mainly responsible for the Ca2 + influx during the Ca2 + -influx phase. The Ca2 + influx through LCCs and the Ca2 + influx from the extracellular space are both responsible for the Ca2 + -influx phase. The Ca2 + release from the SR is triggered by Ca2 + binding to the Ca2 + release channels (ryanodine receptors, RyRs), which are Ca2 + release channels (CaR1s), and is amplified by Ca2 + -induced Ca2 + release (CICR) via the Ca2 + release channels (CaR2s), which are Ca2 + release channels (InsP3R). The Ca2 + influx through LCCs and the Ca2 + influx from the extracellular space are both responsible for the Ca2 + -influx phase. The Ca2 + release from the SR is terminated by Ca2 + reuptake into the SR by Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA). Ca2 + release via CaR1s is terminated by Ca2 + reuptake via SERCA. Ca2 + release via CaR2s is terminated by Ca2 + reuptake via SERCA.",
  "Hyperglycemia causes endothelial dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Hyperglycemia increases the flux of glucose through the aldose reductase pathway, which increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS inactivate nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and increase the expression of adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, leading to the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Hyperglycemia also increases the production of advanced glycation end products (AGE), which bind to the receptor for AGE (RAGE) and activate inflammatory signaling. AGE-RAGE interaction also activates the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway, leading to increased expression of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The activation of hexosamine pathway by high glucose also contributes to endothelial dysfunction. The increased flux of glucose through the hexosamine pathway increases the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of endothelial nuclear and cytosolic proteins. The increased O-GlcNAc modification of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and forkhead transcription factor (FKHR) by high glucose contributes to the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of cytokines.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular responses, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and the immune response. The TNFR family includes several receptors that bind TNF and several that do not.

  "The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a key regulator of B cell development and function. Engagement of the BCR transmits signals that regulate cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. The BCR activates multiple signaling cascades, including the Ras / MAPK pathway. The BCR activates Ras through the Shc / Grb2 / Sos-1 pathway. Ras activates the Raf / MEK / MAPK pathway, which leads to the activation of the transcription factor AP-1. The BCR also activates the JNK pathway, which also leads to activation of AP-1. The BCR also activates the NF-AT pathway, which leads to the induction of the cd79b gene. The NF-AT pathway is also activated by the T cell receptor, and is involved in the regulation of B cell development. The BCR also activates the PI3 kinase pathway, which may contribute to the regulation of B cell development.",
  "The sense of smell is initiated by the binding of odorants to membrane-bound receptor proteins expressed in the cilia of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). The binding of odorants to the receptor proteins triggers the activation of a cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channel (CNG) and a Ca (2 +) -permeable transient receptor potential channel (TRPA), which depolarizes the ORNs. The Na + and Ca 2 + entering the cell through the CNG channel and the TRPA channel, respectively, activate the Na (+) / Ca (2 +) -K + exchanger and the Cl (-) channel, which together lead to an increase in intracellular Na +, a decrease in intracellular Ca (2 +), and an increase in intracellular cGMP. The increase in cGMP activates the cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channel (CNG), which leads to an influx of Na + and a decrease in intracellular Ca (2 +). The increase in intracellular Na + and Cl (-) depolarizes the ORNs and terminates the signaling. The molecular identity of the TRPA channel is still controversial, but it is likely that it is a TRPC channel. The molecular identity of the CNG channel is well established. The CNGA2 subunit is essential for the function of the CNG channel. The CNGA4 subunit can form functional channels with the CNGA2 subunit when it is expressed at high levels. The presence of the CNGA2 subunit is essential for the activation of the CNG channel by odorants. The presence of the CNGA4 subunit does not affect the sensitivity of the channel to odorants, but it does increase the sensitivity of the channel to cGMP. The presence of the CNGA3 subunit further increases the sensitivity of the channel to cGMP. The presence of the olfactory-specific guanylate cyclase (GC-D) is also essential for the activation of the CNG channel by odorants. The binding of odorants to the receptor proteins activates the olfactory-specific soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), which produces cAMP. The increase in cAMP activates the protein kinase A (PKA), which further increases the sensitivity of the CNG channel to odorants. The increase in intracellular Ca (2 +) activates a Ca (2 +) -activated Cl (-) channel, which may further depolarizes the ORNs. The increase in intracellular Na + and Cl (-) may also contribute to the depolarization of the ORNs. The termination of the signaling is achieved by the dephosphorylation of the CNG channel by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which leads to the termination of the signaling.",
  "The Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in development and is also involved in cancer. Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that bind to cell surface receptors and activate intracellular signaling pathways. In the absence of Wnt signaling, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by a complex of proteins including glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), axin, and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein. Phosphorylated beta-catenin is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome. Wnt signaling inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation, causing beta-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, beta-catenin interacts with members of the LEF-1 / TCF family of transcription factors to activate transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Wnt signaling is regulated by a number of other pathways, including the planar cell polarity pathway and the Rho / Rac / JNK pathway.",
  "Blood coagulation is a complex series of reactions that result in the formation of a clot from soluble fibrinogen. The clotting cascade is initiated by the activation of prothrombin by the complex of tissue factor and factor VII. Activated prothrombin cleaves soluble fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that aggregate to form a clot. The fibrin clot is then stabilized by the formation of a three-dimensional network of fibrin fibers. The clot is not only a physical barrier to hemorrhage, but also a temporary reservoir of growth factors that stimulate the repair of damaged tissue. The clotting cascade is negatively regulated by a number of factors, including antithrombin III, protein C and protein S. Antithrombin III inhibits the activity of thrombin, a key enzyme in the cascade. Protein C is activated by thrombin and in turn inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, two cofactors in the prothrombin activation complex. Protein S is a cofactor for activated protein C. The activation of prothrombin by the tissue factor / factor VII complex is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). TFPI is released from the vascular endothelium by the binding of thrombin to fibrin. The activation of prothrombin by the tissue factor / factor VII complex is also inhibited by heparin cofactor II. The activation of protein C by thrombin is inhibited by antithrombin III and thrombomodulin. The inhibition of the clotting cascade by these factors is an important mechanism for the regulation of blood coagulation.",
  "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly specialized structure that separates the central nervous system (CNS) from the peripheral circulation. The BBB consists of three components: a physical barrier, a metabolic barrier, and an active transport barrier. The physical barrier is formed by the end feet of the brain capillary endothelial cells, the tight junctions between them, and the basal lamina. The metabolic barrier is formed by the presence of specific transport systems in the brain capillary endothelial cells that transport essential nutrients and remove metabolic waste products from the brain. The active transport barrier is formed by the presence of efflux pumps and metabolic enzymes in the brain capillary endothelial cells. The presence of these three barriers creates a highly selective environment for the brain. Disruption of the BBB may allow the entry of toxins, pathogens, and / or other factors into the brain, resulting in brain injury or disease. The maintenance of the BBB is essential for the normal function of the CNS. Disruption of the BBB may be caused by a number of factors, including hypertension, hypoxia, and diabetes. Disruption of the BBB may allow the entry of toxins, pathogens, and / or other factors into the brain, resulting in brain injury or disease. The presence of the BBB may also affect the response of the brain to injury or disease. The BBB may protect the brain from the effects of inflammation and infection by preventing the entry of circulating leukocytes and other inflammatory cells into the brain. The presence of efflux pumps and metabolic enzymes in the brain capillary endothelial cells may also protect the brain from the effects of toxins and drugs. Disruption of the BBB may allow the entry of circulating inflammatory cells and toxins into the brain, resulting in brain injury or disease.",
  "The immune system is a network of cells and molecules that provide protection against infectious agents and that also contributes to the development of autoimmune and allergic diseases. The immune system is composed of two major parts, the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system consists of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells that lack the capacity to mount an immune response but that are involved in the early stages of immune responses. The adaptive immune system consists of B cells and T cells that are generated from progenitor cells in the bone marrow and that undergo clonal expansion in response to antigen stimulation and differentiation into memory cells and effector cells. B cells produce antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA classes. T cells are classified into two major subsets, T helper (Th) cells and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, based on their functions. Th cells are further subdivided into Th1 and Th2 cells, based on their cytokine profiles. Th1 cells produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-12, which are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which are involved in humoral immunity.",
  "Interleukin-1 2 (IL-1 2) is a key cytokine in cell-mediated immunity. IL-1 2 is secreted by activated macrophages and dendritic cells and stimulates the proliferation of Th1 cells and production of interferon-gamma by Th1 cells. IL-1 2 also stimulates the production of other cytokines such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-alpha. The IL-1 2 receptor is a heterodimer of IL-1 2R beta 1 and IL-1 2R gamma 2 subunits. The IL-1 2R beta 1 subunit is shared with the IL-2 receptor, while the IL-1 2R gamma 2 subunit is unique to the IL-1 2 receptor. Binding of IL-1 2 to its receptor activates JAK tyrosine kinases and STAT transcription factors. The JAK kinases phosphorylate the IL-1 2R beta 1 and IL-1 2R gamma 2 subunits, activating STAT transcription factors that translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of genes involved in the immune response. The IL-1 2 receptor is also required for signaling by IL-2. The IL-2 receptor is composed of IL-2 receptor alpha and beta subunits, while the gamma subunit is shared with the IL-4 receptor. The IL-2 receptor is required for proliferation of T cells, while the gamma chain is not. The IL-4 receptor is required for differentiation of Th2 cells.",
  "Chemokine receptors are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that bind chemotactic cytokines and are expressed on leukocytes. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is expressed on leukocytes and plays a role in leukocyte trafficking and homing to tissues. The ligand for CXCR4 is the chemokine SDF1and is also known as CXCL1 2. The CXCR4 / SDF1axis is involved in the immune response to HIV infection and is involved in the metastasis of cancer cells. The CXCR4 / SDF1axis also plays a role in the development of the nervous system. The activation of CXCR4 by SDF1leads to the activation of the Gi protein and downstream signaling pathways including the MAP kinase pathway, the PI3 kinase pathway and the p38 kinase pathway. The downstream signaling pathways activated by CXCR4 lead to changes in cell shape and motility and are involved in cell migration, homing and development.",
  "Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow direct transfer of small molecules between cells. They are formed by association of two hexameric protein subunits, connexons, which are inserted into the plasma membrane of each cell. Each connexon is formed by the oligomerization of the proteins termed connexins. Gap junction channels are permeable to ions, small metabolites and second messengers. The permeability of the channels is regulated by several mechanisms, including transjunctional voltage, pH, transjunctional tension, phosphorylation and Ca2 +. The function of gap junctions is to provide a direct communication between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Gap junctional communication is essential for the coordinated activity of tissues and organs. Communication through gap junctions is involved in the control of development, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mutations in the connexin genes are associated with several human diseases.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The binding of EGF or other ligands to the extracellular domain of the receptor results in the formation of receptor homo- or heterodimers, activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and phosphorylation of intracellular substrates that mediate cellular proliferation and differentiation. The binding of EGF to the EGFR induces receptor dimerization and activation, and the receptor is rapidly internalized after ligand binding. The receptor is then either recycled to the cell surface or degraded in the lysosome. The signaling pathway activated by the EGFR is complex and includes the ras-raf-MAPK pathway, phospholipase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The net effect of EGFR activation is proliferation. The EGFR is over-expressed in a variety of human cancers, including cancers of the breast, lung, stomach, and ovary. The EGFR is also a target of therapeutic antibodies and kinase inhibitors.",
  "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that is characterized by progressive fibrofatty replacement of cardiac muscle, predominantly in the right ventricle, and is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of a discrete region of myocardial atrophy and adipose or fibrofatty replacement, which may be transmural or localized to the interventricular septum. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of a fibrofatty lesion, which is histologically distinct from other forms of cardiomyopathy. The etiology of ARVC is heterogeneous, with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance patterns all having been observed. Mutations in genes encoding components of the cardiac desmosome have been identified in patients with ARVC, supporting the hypothesis that this disorder is caused by defective cell-cell adhesion. The desmosome is a specialized intercellular adhesion structure that provides mechanical strength to the myocardium and is essential for normal cardiac development and function. The desmosomal proteins plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin are components of the intracellular plaque of the desmosome. Mutations in plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin have been identified in patients with ARVC. These mutations are predicted to result in a truncated protein or haploinsufficiency. The plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin proteins are also components of the adherens junction, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity. Mutations in the gene encoding desmoplakin are associated with the autosomal dominant form of ARVC. Desmoplakin is a component of the desmosome and the desmosomal plaque. Mutations in the gene encoding desmoplakin have been identified in patients with ARVC. Desmoplakin is also a component of the adherens junction. The adherens junction is involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity. Mutations in the gene encoding N-cadherin have been identified in patients with ARVC. N-cadherin is a component of the adherens junction and the desmosome. The N-cadherin mutations are predicted to result in a truncated protein or haploinsufficiency. The plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin proteins are also components of the nuclear envelope. The plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin proteins are involved in the regulation of gene expression. Mutations in these genes may result in a loss of normal protein function or a dominant-negative effect. The plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin proteins are also components of the epidermal cornified envelope. Mutations in the gene encoding keratin-8 have been identified in patients with ARVC. Keratin-8 is a component of the epidermal cornified envelope. The keratin-8 mutations are predicted to result in a dominant-negative effect. The role of the ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) gene in ARVC is less clear. RYR2 is a component of the calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The RYR2 gene mutations may result in a gain of function or a dominant-negative effect.",
  "Salmonella typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in humans and a similar disease in mice. Salmonella enters intestinal epithelial cells by a process involving the interaction of bacterial proteins with the basolateral membrane. Salmonella then uses the host cell's actin cytoskeleton to move through the cytoplasm and into adjacent cells. The bacteria then replicate in the host cell's cytoplasm and spread to adjacent cells by inducing the formation of membrane protrusions that are subsequently engulfed by the infected cell's own membrane. The Salmonella protein SopE activates the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc4 2, which in turn stimulate the formation of actin-based membrane protrusions. The Salmonella protein SptP deactivates the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK), which normally inhibits membrane protrusion formation. The bacterium's own SopE also contributes to the induction of membrane protrusions. The activation of the Map kinase Erk by Rac and Cdc4 2 is also involved in the formation of membrane protrusions. The activation of the tyrosine kinase Src by SopE may also contribute to the formation of membrane protrusions. The ability of Salmonella to enter intestinal epithelial cells is a key step in the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection. The ability of Salmonella to enter intestinal epithelial cells is dependent on the SopE-induced activation of the small GTPase Rac. The activation of Rac by SopE may also contribute to the induction of membrane protrusions. The ability of Salmonella to enter intestinal epithelial cells is also dependent on the Salmonella protein SptP, which deactivates the Map kinase Erk. Erk activation by SopE may also contribute to the induction of membrane protrusions. The activation of the tyrosine kinase Src by SopE may also contribute to the formation of membrane protrusions. The interaction of Salmonella with the host cell's actin cytoskeleton is also important for the intracellular movement of Salmonella. The interaction of the Salmonella protein SipA with the actin cytoskeleton may also contribute to the intracellular movement of Salmonella. The interaction of the Salmonella protein SipB with the actin cytoskeleton may also contribute to the intracellular movement of Salmonella.

  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against microbial pathogens. It is comprised of a set of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize conserved microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of PRRs that recognize a variety of PAMPs. Upon recognition of PAMPs, TLRs trigger signaling cascades that lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon.",
  "Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a major cellular substrate for protein kinase C (PKC). MARCKS is a major substrate for PKC in platelets and is involved in platelet secretion. MARCKS is also involved in other cellular functions such as cell motility, cell shape and membrane trafficking. MARCKS is a substrate for PKC in many cell types and is phosphorylated on serine residues by PKC on the serine residues in the sequence -Ser-Glu-Ala-Met-Gln-Leu-. The phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC causes the protein to unfold and the protein to translocate from the membrane to the cytoplasm. The unphophorylated form of MARCKS binds to the membrane and is anchored to the membrane by the myristoylated N-terminus. The unphophorylated form of MARCKS is anchored to the membrane by the myristoylated N-terminus and the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain causes the protein to unfold and translocate to the cytoplasm.

  "The mitotic cell cycle is a highly coordinated sequence of events that result in the segregation of chromosomes into two daughter cells. The G2 phase of the cell cycle is a period of growth and preparation for mitosis. Mitosis is initiated by the activation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF), a heterodimer of CDC2 (CDK1) and cyclin B. MPF is maintained in an inactive state during G2 by the kinase WEE1 and the phosphatase CDC2 5C. Entry into mitosis is triggered by the removal of inhibitory phosphate groups from CDC2 by the dual-specificity phosphatase CDC2 5C. The activation of MPF is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle. MPF activation is triggered by the activation of the cyclin B-CDC2 complex, which is triggered by the removal of inhibitory phosphate groups by the dual-specificity phosphatase CDC2 5C. The activity of MPF is negatively regulated by the protein kinase Wee1 and the protein phosphatase PP2A. The activity of the cyclin B-CDC2 complex is also regulated by the phosphorylation of CDC2 and cyclin B. Phosphorylation of CDC2 increases its kinase activity, whereas phosphorylation of cyclin B decreases its stability and decreases its affinity for CDC2. The activity of the cyclin B-CDC2 complex is also regulated by the synthesis and degradation of cyclin B. The activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is also regulated by phosphorylation. The APC is a ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation by the proteosome. The APC is activated by the APC activators CDC2 0 and CDH1. The activity of the APC is inhibited by the checkpoint proteins MAD224 and BUBR1.",

  "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that is produced by T cells and is involved in the regulation of the immune system. IL-4 stimulates the growth and differentiation of B cells and is involved in the development of certain types of allergies. The production of IL-4 is regulated by a transcription factor called GATA-3. In addition to regulating the production of IL-4, GATA-3 also regulates the production of other factors involved in the immune system, such as the cytokine IL-5 and the IgE receptor.

  "Taste perception begins with the interaction of tastants with membrane bound receptors on the apical surface of taste cells. The transduction pathway for umami, sweet, and bitter taste stimuli is well established and begins with the binding of ligand to a specific receptor, activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor, and activation of a downstream signaling pathway. In the case of umami and sweet taste, binding of glutamate or sugars to the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR4) or the sweet receptor (T1R2 / T1R3) activates gustducin, which stimulates the activation of the G protein subunit, gustducin, and its associated effector, the membrane bound phosphodiesterase (PDE). Activation of PDE leads to the breakdown of the second messenger, cAMP, which inhibits the activity of the basolateral Na + / K + -ATPase, depolarizing the cell and increasing its intracellular concentration. The depolarization opens a variety of ion channels, including the transient receptor potential channel M5 (TRPM5), which allows cations to flow down their electrochemical gradients into the cell. The influx of cations depolarizes the cell and activates voltage-gated channels, triggering action potentials and the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and ATP. In the case of bitter taste, binding of tastant to the metabotropic taste receptor (T2R1 / T2R3) activates a G protein complex (gustducin / Galpha14), which stimulates the phosphodiesterase to produce a similar response. The downstream effects of bitter taste transduction are not well understood, but may involve the opening of ion channels or the inhibition of the Na + / K + -ATPase.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is used by cells to transduce a variety of extracellular signals into intracellular responses. The cascade begins with the activation of a MAPKKK (MAPKKK = MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase), which phosphorylates and activates a MAPKK (MAP kinase kinase), which in turn activates a MAPK (MAP kinase). There are four major groups of MAPKs: ERKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinases), JNKs (Jun N-terminal kinases), JNKs / SAPKs (stress-activated protein kinases), and p3 8MAPKs. Each group includes several members. The cascade terminates with the phosphorylation and activation of a MAPK by its corresponding MAPKK. The complexity of this system is increased by the existence of multiple isoforms of each component, as well as the existence of various scaffolds and adaptors that provide additional levels of regulation.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly regulated process that ensures that the cell has enough nutrients and energy to replicate its DNA and then segregate its chromosomes and divide into two daughter cells. The cell cycle is also regulated by checkpoints that prevent the cell from entering into or exiting from the cell cycle if there is not sufficient time to repair DNA damage. If the cell cannot repair DNA damage, the cell undergoes apoptosis. The cell cycle is regulated by a group of proteins called cyclins that are expressed at specific times during the cell cycle. Cyclins bind to cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and activate the kinase activity of the cyclin-CDK complex. The cyclin-CDK complex phosphorylates and thereby regulates the activity of other proteins that control the cell cycle. One of the key targets of the cyclin-CDK complex is the RB protein, which is a tumor suppressor. When RB is phosphorylated by the cyclin-CDK complex, it no longer binds to and inhibits the activity of E2F, a transcription factor that regulates genes that control the G1 to S phase transition. Another key target of the cyclin-CDK complex is the p53 tumor suppressor, which is also an E2F target. When p53 is phosphorylated by the cyclin-CDK complex, it is stabilized and induces apoptosis. Another key regulator of the cell cycle is the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is mutated or deleted in many cancers. When p53 is not phosphorylated, it binds to MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation by the proteosome. When phosphorylated by the cyclin-CDK complex, MDM2 no longer binds to p53, and p53 is stabilized and accumulates in the cell. Another key regulator of the cell cycle is the tumor suppressor protein RB. When unphosphorylated, RB binds to E2F and inhibits the activity of E2F. When phosphorylated by the cyclin-CDK complex, RB no longer binds to E2F and the activity of E2F is no longer inhibited. Another key regulator of the cell cycle is the tumor suppressor protein p53. When unphosphorylated, p53 binds to MDM2 and induces the proteosomal degradation of p53. When phosphorylated, p53 no longer binds to MDM2 and is stabilized and accumulates in the cell.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by binding of its ligand, epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF binding to the receptor induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. The phosphorylated tyrosines serve as binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, including the adaptor protein Shc, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Shc and Sos-1 activate the Ras / Raf / Mek / Erk pathway, leading to cell proliferation. SHP-2 dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor Stat-3, leading to cell survival. The Cbl protein binds to the EGFR and targets it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. The Cbl protein also binds to the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, and may regulate its activity.",
  "TNF is a potent cytokine that can induce a variety of cellular responses including apoptosis, inflammation, and the regulation of cell proliferation. The cellular responses to TNF are mediated through two distinct cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR1 is expressed at high levels by most cells and binds both soluble and membrane-bound TNF. In contrast, TNFR2 is expressed at low levels by most cells and binds only membrane-bound TNF. The binding of TNF to its receptors induces the recruitment of several signaling molecules to the receptor complex. The adaptor protein TRADD is recruited to the receptor complex through the interaction of its death domain with the death domain of TNFR1. TRAF2 is also recruited to the receptor complex through the interaction of its TRAF domain with the death domain of TNFR1. TRAF2 is a member of a family of proteins that are involved in the transduction of signals from TNF receptors to downstream signaling pathways. The activation of the transcription factor NF-kB by TNF is one of the signaling pathways that is mediated by the TNF receptors. TRAF2 has been shown to play an important role in this pathway through its interaction with the I-kappa B kinase (IKK) complex. The activation of NF-kB by TNF is important for the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. The activation of NF-kB by TNF is also involved in the regulation of the expression of genes involved in inflammation and the immune response. The activation of NF-kB by TNF also plays an important role in the inhibition of apoptosis induced by TNF. The activation of NF-kB by TNF also induces the expression of genes involved in the inhibition of apoptosis.

  "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is a major mechanism for the degradation of intracellular proteins. Proteins are tagged with ubiquitin, a 7 6-amino acid peptide, before being degraded by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large, multi-subunit protease complex that degrades proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. The proteasome is composed of a two major components, a core particle (CP) and a regulatory particle (RP). The CP is a cylindrical structure with a central proteolytic core and the RP is a regulatory particle that binds to the ends of the core particle and is involved in the recognition, unfolding, and degradation of proteins. The RP is composed of PA70 0 (PA38) in eukaryotes and PA38 in prokaryotes. PA38 is a ring-shaped structure that binds to the ends of the CP and consists of two heptameric rings stacked upon each other. The PA28 regulatory complex is a heterodimer of PA29 and PA70 in eukaryotes and a homoheptamer in prokaryotes. PA28 binds to PA37and functions as the recognition factor for the proteasome and also as an activator of the CP. PA29 is an ATPase that opens the PA70 / PA38 complex to allow substrates to enter the core particle. PA34 is a non-ATPase regulatory subunit that is involved in the degradation of abnormal proteins and is found in a complex with PA28. PA28 and PA34 are replaced by PA10 when PA28 is activated. The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes are involved in the ubiquitination of proteins. The transfer of ubiquitin to proteins requires a three-step reaction. E1 activates ubiquitin by transferring its C-terminal glycine to a cysteine in an E1-ubiquitin complex. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to the active site cysteine of an E2 enzyme. Finally, an E3 enzyme ligates ubiquitin to the protein that is to be degraded by the proteasome. The specificity of the ubiquitination process is determined by the E3 enzymes. The proteasome is a multi-protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The proteasome is a threonine protease that degrades proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. The degradation of proteins by the proteasome is preceded by the removal of the ubiquitin by a deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB). The proteasome is composed of four rings stacked together to form a 20S core particle. The two inner rings are each composed of 14 subunits, two of which are beta-subunits that form the proteolytic core. The two outer rings are each composed of 14 subunits each. The core particle is a cylindrical structure with a central cavity. Proteins that are to be degraded are unfolded by PA28 and then translocated into the core particle by PA27. Once inside the core particle, the protein is rapidly degraded by the proteases.",
  "Selectins are a family of adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of leukocytes that bind to carbohydrate ligands on the surface of endothelial cells. The selectins are involved in the initial interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium and are required for the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium. P-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated platelets and is released upon platelet activation. P-selectin binds to sialyl Lewis (x) (sLe (x)), a carbohydrate ligand expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells. E-selectin is expressed on the surface of cytokine activated endothelial cells and binds to the carbohydrate ligand sialyl Lewis (a) (sLe (a)). L-selectin is expressed on the surface of leukocytes and binds to sialyl Lewis (a) (sLe (a)). The interaction of selectins with their carbohydrate ligands mediates the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium, a critical first step in the subsequent adhesion and migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Selectins are also involved in other aspects of inflammation including leukocyte activation and migration to sites of inflammation. Selectins are also expressed on other cell types and may play a role in other aspects of inflammation.",
  "The methionine cycle is a central pathway for the metabolism of methionine and related sulfur-containing amino acids. The methionine cycle begins with the absorption of methionine from the diet and its conversion to AdoMet by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). AdoMet is the methyl donor for a variety of reactions including methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to a variety of acceptors is a reversible reaction and can be removed by the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) to regenerate methionine and generate NADPH. The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to homocysteine (Hcy) is a reaction that is irreversible under normal physiological conditions. The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to Hcy is a reaction that is catalyzed by a number of methyltransferases. The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to DNA is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to RNA is catalyzed by RNA methyltransferases (RNMTs). The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to proteins is catalyzed by protein methyltransferases (PMTs). The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to lipids is catalyzed by methyltransferases (MTases). The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to methionine is a reaction that is catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). The transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to homocysteine is a reaction that is catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS). The activity of MAT is regulated by methionine and AdoMet. AdoMet is synthesized from methionine and ATP by MAT. The concentration of AdoMet is regulated by methionine and by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). The concentration of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) is regulated by S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAHS). The ratio of AdoMet / AdoHcy is an important indicator of the methylation status of a cell. The ratio of AdoMet / AdoHcy is high when methylation is extensive and low when methylation is limited. The activity of methionine synthase (MS) is also regulated by methionine and by vitamin B1 2. The activity of methionine synthase reductase (MSR) is regulated by the concentration of folate. The activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) is regulated by betaine.",
  "Spliceosomes are large complexes that catalyze the excision of noncoding sequences (introns) from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons in a process known as pre-mRNA splicing. Spliceosomes are ribonucleoprotein complexes consisting of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and many additional proteins. The snRNPs are the key components of spliceosomes and are responsible for the recognition of splice sites and the catalysis of the transesterification reactions. Spliceosomes assemble on the pre-mRNA in a stepwise manner. The spliceosome is a dynamic structure that changes its composition and conformation during the splicing reaction.",
  "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Angiotensinogen is secreted into the circulation by the liver and is cleaved by the enzyme renin to form angiotensin I (AngI). AngI is further cleaved by the enzyme ACE to form the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII). AngII is a peptide that binds to two different receptors, AT1 and AT2, to exert its effects. The AT1 receptor is coupled to G proteins and activates a number of signaling pathways, including the production of inositol phosphates and calcium mobilization. The AT2 receptor is coupled to G proteins that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate MAP kinase. AngII also stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. AngII also stimulates the synthesis and secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex. The actions of AngII are attenuated by the ACE inhibitor captopril and the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan. The importance of the RAS in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function is demonstrated by the fact that blocking the actions of AngII with either losartan or ACE inhibitors lowers blood pressure and reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",
  "The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor plays a central role in the regulation of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in the regulation of apoptosis. NF-kB is activated by a variety of stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-1rI, viral infection, and antigen receptor stimulation. In the classical pathway, NF-kB is kept inactive in the cytoplasm by association with the inhibitor protein, IkB. Stimuli that activate NF-kB lead to the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and bind to its cognate DNA sequence. In the nucleus, NF-kB interacts with a variety of coactivators and coregulators to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes. The transcriptional activity of NF-kB is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation. The transcriptional activity of NF-kB is also regulated by the inhibitor of NF-kB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates IkB and also the p6 5 subunit of NF-kB. The IKK complex is a multi-subunit complex that includes two kinases, IKK1 / IKKa and IKK2 / IKKb, and a regulatory subunit, IKKg. The IKK1 / IKKa subunit is a member of the MAP kinase family, whereas IKK2 / IKKb is a member of the casein kinase I family. The IKK1 / IKKa subunit is constitutively associated with NF-kB, while the IKK2 / IKKb subunit is recruited to NF-kB by interaction with the IKK1 / IKKa subunit. The IKK1 / IKKa subunit phosphorylates IkB, targeting it for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The IKK2 / IKKb subunit phosphorylates the transcriptional activation domain of NF-kB, increasing its transcriptional activity. The transcriptional activity of NF-kB is also regulated by the interaction with other proteins. The transcriptional repressor I-kB is phosphorylated by IKK2 / IKKb, targeting it for degradation. The transcriptional coactivator CBP / 3 0 is also phosphorylated by IKK2 / IKKb, increasing its transcriptional activity. The transcriptional repressor p300 is also phosphorylated by IKK2 / IKKb, targeting it for degradation. The regulation of NF-kB by phosphorylation is a complex process involving the interaction of multiple kinases and transcription factors.",
  "The Tax protein of HTLV-1 is a key factor in the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Tax interacts with a variety of cellular factors and modulates their functions. Tax interacts with p53, a tumor suppressor, and induces its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Tax also interacts with the tumor suppressor gene product p53, and induces its degradation. Tax also interacts with the CBP / p3 0 0 transcriptional coactivators, and represses their transcriptional activities. Tax also interacts with the CREB transcription factor, and activates the transcription of the viral promoter through the viral CRE (vCRE). Tax also interacts with the CREB-binding protein (CBP), and represses the CBP-mediated transcriptional activation of cellular genes. Tax represses the transcriptional activation of the MHC-1 gene by the transcription factor NF-kB. Tax also interacts with the I-mfa family of transcriptional repressors, and represses their transcriptional activities. Tax also interacts with the tumor suppressor gene product WT1, and represses its transcriptional activity.",
  "Type II allergic reactions are mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that bind to specific antigens. Antigen-specific IgE antibodies are produced by B cells in response to exposure to allergens. Crosslinking of IgE bound to the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils by allergens leads to the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, that cause the symptoms of allergy. Cross-linking of IgE bound to FcepsilonRI on T cells by allergens on antigen-presenting cells (APC) can lead to the activation of T cells.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved microbial components and activate innate immune responses. The intracellular domain of TLRs recruits the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 8 8 (MyD8 8), which leads to activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways and production of proinflammatory cytokines. The cytoplasmic domain of TLR2 and TLR4 also recruits the adaptor protein TIRAP / Mal (MyD8 8 adaptor-like protein), which mediates activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways but not the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Instead, TIRAP / Mal mediates activation of the transcription factor IRF-1 and the production of type I interferon in response to LPS.",
  "The death receptor Fas (also called APO1, CD9 5, or TNFRSF6) is a member of the TNF receptor gene family. Fas is expressed on the surface of a variety of cells, including B cells, T cells, monocytes, and some tumor cells. Fas-mediated apoptosis is involved in the regulation of immune responses, elimination of virus-infected cells, and the maintenance of immune tolerance. The Fas-Fas ligand interaction induces the recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) to the cytoplasmic domain of Fas. FADD in turn recruits caspase-8 through its death effector domain (DED). The formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) leads to the activation of caspase-8, which in turn activates caspase-3 and other downstream caspases, leading to apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial membrane permeability. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, localize to the mitochondrial membrane and prevent the release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial factors into the cytoplasm. The Bcl-2 family includes both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins. The anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, localize to the mitochondrial membrane and prevent the release of cytochrome c. The pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bok, and Bad, which are localized in the cytosol, translocate to the mitochondrial membrane and induce the release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c in the cytoplasm binds to apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and triggers the oligomerization of Apaf-1. The resulting activated Apaf-1 promotes the activation of caspase-9 and the subsequent caspase cascade.",
  "Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response of the heart to increased mechanical stress or increased neurohormonal stimuli. It is initially an adaptive response that serves to maintain cardiac output, but prolonged hypertrophy can lead to heart failure. The transition from adaptive to pathological cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by a fetal gene program, in which the adult cardiac genes are re-expressed. This fetal gene program is thought to be detrimental and contributes to the deterioration of cardiac function. The transition from adaptive to pathological cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. Calcium / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a calcium-sensing enzyme that is activated by increased intracellular calcium. CaMKII in turn activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors. CaMKII-dependent activation of NFAT induces the fetal gene program and cardiac hypertrophy. The activity of CaMKII is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor protein, calmesin. The activity of calmesin is regulated by the oxidation of methionine residues. The oxidation of methionine residues in calmesin by reactive oxygen species (ROS) activates CaMKII and induces cardiac hypertrophy. The activation of CaMKII by ROS is not dependent on calcium, but rather on the oxidation of methionine residues in calmesin. The activation of CaMKII by ROS is blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, indicating that ROS are upstream of CaMKII. The activation of CaMKII by ROS is not dependent on calmodulin. The activation of CaMKII by ROS is not dependent on calcium, but rather on the oxidation of methionine residues in calmesin.

  "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent mitogen for many cell types. IGF-1 signals through the IGF-1 receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor gene family. Binding of IGF-1 to the IGF-1 receptor leads to receptor autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways. IGF-1 signaling is involved in normal development and growth, and IGF-1 signaling is also involved in the proliferation of transformed cells. IGF-1 signaling activates the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway, and also activates the PI-3 kinase pathway. Both of these pathways lead to the activation of the transcription factor AP-1, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. IGF-1 also activates the transcription factor ELK-1, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The activation of ELK-1 by IGF-1 is independent of the MEK / ERK pathway, but does require PI-3 kinase activity. The transcription factor STAT5 is activated by the IGF-1 receptor and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The activation of STAT5 by the IGF-1 receptor is independent of the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway, but requires PI-3 kinase activity. The activation of STAT5 by the IGF-1 receptor is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation is a key component of the inflammatory response. Infiltration of leukocytes into tissues is a hallmark of inflammatory responses, such as in arthritis. The process of leukocyte recruitment is complex and involves the sequential interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium of the blood vessel wall, their subsequent diapedesis through the endothelium of the blood vessel wall, and their subsequent migration into the extracellular matrix of the tissue. The multistep model of leukocyte recruitment has been used to describe the sequence of events involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites. The first step in the recruitment of leukocytes is the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium of the blood vessel wall. This is mediated by the interaction of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) with its endothelial ligand ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1). The binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 is regulated by chemokines such as IL-8. The rolling of leukocytes along the endothelium is mediated by the interaction of the selectin family of adhesion molecules with their ligands on the endothelium. The selectin-mediated rolling of leukocytes is followed by their activation and firm adhesion by the interaction of the integrin LFA-1 with ICAM-1. The firm adhesion of leukocytes is followed by their transendothelial migration. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is involved in this process. The migration of leukocytes from the blood stream into the extracellular matrix of tissues is also a key step in the inflammatory response. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is involved in this process.",
  "The invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a key feature of these pathogens. The ability of these pathogens to adhere to and invade the intestinal epithelium is essential for disease. EPEC and EHEC are closely related pathogens that are able to cause disease by attaching and effacing (A / E) lesion formation on intestinal epithelial cells. The genes required for A / E lesion formation are located on a 3 5-kb pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). The LEE-encoded proteins include intimin, Tir, EspA, EspD, and EspB. Tir is an integral membrane protein that is inserted into the plasma membrane and that is translocated into the host cell by the LEE-encoded type III secretion system. Tir is subsequently tyrosine phosphorylated by a host cell kinase, and this phosphorylation is required for the formation of actin pedestals. Intimin is a surface protein that mediates the intimate attachment of EPEC and EHEC to the host cell. The formation of A / E lesions is associated with the localized destruction of the brush border microvilli. In addition to their role in pathogenesis, intimin and Tir are also involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.",
  "The HTLV-1 virus causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) after a long latent period. The virus encodes a regulatory protein, Tax, that activates transcription from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) and from many cellular promoters. Tax also induces cellular transformation. The cellular targets of Tax include p53, a tumor suppressor, and the tumor suppressor p16INK4a. The activation of NF-kB by Tax contributes to cellular transformation. The activation of the JAK / STAT pathway by Tax contributes to cellular transformation.",
  "Gap junctions are clusters of intercellular channels that allow direct communication between cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two hemichannels, each containing six connexin subunits. Each hemichannel is a hexamer of a connexin subunit. Each hemichannel is located in the plasma membrane of an adjacent cell. Each hemichannel is connected to the junctional compartment of the cell by a cytoplasmic channel. Each hemichannel is gated by transjunctional voltage (Vj) and by the transjunctional conductance (Gj). The gating of each hemichannel is determined by the relative transjunctional voltage and the transjunctional conductance. The opening of each hemichannel causes the flow of ions and small molecules between the two cells. Gap junctions are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell growth and differentiation, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, and control of tissue homeostasis. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is regulated by a variety of factors, including phosphorylation, intracellular calcium, pH, redox state, transjunctional voltage, and membrane lipids.",
  "The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that modulate a variety of physiological processes, including learning and memory, nociception, and neuronal development. The mGluRs are divided into three groups based on sequence homology, G-protein coupling, and pharmacological profile: group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5), group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3), and group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8). The mGluRs are expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), with group I mGluRs primarily expressed on the postsynaptic membrane, and group II and group III mGluRs expressed on both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. Upon glutamate binding, the mGluRs activate G-proteins, resulting in the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent release of IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to its receptor on the ER membrane, causing the release of calcium into the cytosol. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) through the production of the second messenger DAG. The mGluRs also activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) / Akt pathways. The mGluRs are involved in a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, and drug abuse. The mGluRs are also potential drug targets for the treatment of these disorders.",
  "TNF is a cytokine that induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types. The cytotoxic effects of TNF are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Binding of TNF to TNFR1 leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein TRADD and the subsequent recruitment of the protein kinases RIP, TRAF2 and FADD. RIP and TRAF2 are involved in the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways, while FADD is required for the recruitment and activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 activation results in the proteolytic processing and activation of caspase-3, which in turn cleaves cellular substrates, triggering DNA fragmentation and other cellular changes associated with apoptosis. Caspase-8 also cleaves Bid, a Bcl-2 family protein, to form tBid, which translocates to mitochondria and induces the release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c activates Apaf-1, which in turn activates caspase-9, which then activates caspase-3 and other downstream caspases. The activation of JNK and NF-kappaB by TNF is mediated by TRAF2 and RIP, respectively. NF-kappaB activation inhibits apoptosis by inducing the expression of genes that block the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c.",
  "PML is a tumor suppressor protein that is involved in apoptosis and transcriptional regulation. PML is a component of nuclear bodies, which are dynamic structures associated with the nuclear matrix. PML nuclear bodies are involved in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. PML nuclear bodies are disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by the expression of the PML-RAR alpha fusion protein, resulting in a loss of PML tumor suppressor activity. PML nuclear bodies are also disrupted in cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is expressed in EBV associated B cell lymphomas and disrupts PML nuclear bodies. PML nuclear bodies are also disrupted in cells expressing the E6 protein of the human papillomavirus (HPV). The disruption of PML nuclear bodies by these viral proteins may contribute to the development of EBV associated lymphomas and HPV associated cancers.",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of circulating autoantibodies against nuclear antigens. The formation of autoantibodies is the hallmark of SLE. The production of autoantibodies is a result of the breakdown of self-tolerance. The production of autoantibodies is under the control of multiple mechanisms. The production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens is the result of the loss of self-tolerance. The breakdown of self-tolerance is caused by genetic factors and environmental factors. The genetic factors include the presence of certain genes that increase the risk of developing SLE and the presence of certain genes that decrease the threshold for the induction of autoimmunity. Environmental factors include infections, ultraviolet light, drugs, and smoking. The production of autoantibodies is also under the control of other mechanisms. The production of autoantibodies is the result of the interaction of multiple mechanisms.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled process of cellular self-destruction that plays a key role in development and tissue homeostasis. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is activated by a variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, and ER stress. These stresses activate the multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, which induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Cytochrome c in the cytosol binds to Apaf-1, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) -containing protein, and recruits caspase-9 into a complex termed the apoptosome. Caspase-9 then activates the rest of the caspase cascade, which leads to the proteolytic degradation of cellular substrates and cell death. IAP proteins bind to the caspase-inhibitory domain of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and inhibit apoptosis. IAP proteins also bind to Smac / DIABLO, a protein released from the mitochondria that antagonizes IAP proteins and promotes apoptosis.",
  "The cell cycle is driven by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulators, cyclins. CDKs are a family of serine / threonine protein kinases that are activated by binding to regulatory cyclins. The activity of CDKs is negatively regulated by CDK inhibitors (CKIs). CDKs are themselves regulated by phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation. CDK activity is required for the G1 / S and G2 / M transitions. The G1 / S transition is promoted by the activity of cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2. The activation of cyclin E-CDK2 is negatively regulated by the CKI p16Ink4. The activation of cyclin A-CDK2 is negatively regulated by the CKI p27Kip1. The G2 / M transition is promoted by the activation of cyclin B-CDK1. The activity of cyclin B-CDK1 is negatively regulated by the phosphatase CDC2 5C. The activity of CDKs is also regulated by their abundance. The levels of cyclins are regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The destruction of p16Ink4 and p27Kip1 by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway allows the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2, respectively. The levels of cyclins are also regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The destruction of cyclin A is promoted by the phosphorylation of cyclin A by CDK1. The destruction of cyclin B is promoted by the phosphorylation of cyclin B. The activation of cyclin B-CDK1 is negatively regulated by the phosphatase CDC2 5C. The activity of CDKs is also regulated by their phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of CDKs by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is required for CDK activation. The CDK-counteracting phosphatases, protein phosphatases 1and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), are required for CDK inactivation. The activity of PP1 and PP2A is negatively regulated by the kinase WEE1 and the kinase CDC2 5C. The activity of PP2A is also negatively regulated by the kinase CDC25R1.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The binding of EGF-like growth factors to the extracellular domain of the receptor leads to receptor dimerization and activation of its intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. This in turn leads to the phosphorylation of various cellular substrates and initiation of signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant signaling by EGFR or its ligands has been implicated in the development and progression of a variety of human cancers. The EGFR gene is frequently amplified or rearranged in tumor cells, and high levels of EGFR expression have been associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and resistance to therapy. EGFR inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials as potential cancer therapies.",
  "The complement system is an important part of the immune system that helps to identify and destroy invading pathogens. The complement system is composed of more than thirty different proteins and protein fragments that work in a cascade of proteolytic activation to form a proteolytic cascade that lyses cells and helps to opsonize and clear pathogens. The complement system is activated by three different pathways, the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. Each pathway begins with the recognition of an infection by a pattern recognition molecule, such as the C1 protein in the classical pathway, or mannose-binding lectin in the lectin pathway. This recognition leads to the activation of the complement cascade through a series of proteolytic reactions. The classical pathway is initiated by the recognition of foreign antigen by the C1 complex, which is a complex of the proteins C1q, C1r, and C1s. The recognition of antigen by C1 leads to the activation of C1s, which cleaves C4 and C2 to form C4bC2a. The C4bC2a complex binds to the activating surface and cleaves additional C3 molecules to form the C3 convertase. The C3 convertase cleaves additional C3 molecules to form the C3 convertase, C3bBbC3b. The cleavage of C3 by C3 convertase creates a new C3 convertase that cleaves more C3, forming a positive feedback loop that quickly increases the number of C3 convertases. The C5 convertase cleaves C5 to form the anaphylatoxin C5a, which recruits phagocytes to the site of infection, and the membrane attack complex (MAC), which lyses cells. The lectin pathway is initiated by the recognition of carbohydrate patterns on the surface of bacteria by mannan-binding lectin (MBL). The recognition of carbohydrate by MBL leads to the activation of the protease MASP-2, which cleaves C4 and C2 to form the C3 convertase. The alternative pathway is initiated by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, which leads to the formation of C3 (H2O), a C3 fragment that can form a C3 convertase without the need for a recognition molecule or a pattern recognition molecule. The C3 convertase formed by the alternative pathway cleaves additional C3 to form more C3 convertase. The three pathways converge on the cleavage of C5, which is the critical step in the formation of the MAC and the subsequent lysis of cells.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a complex of two polypeptides, alpha and beta, that is expressed on the cell surface in association with three other proteins, CD3. The TCR is responsible for the recognition of foreign antigens in the form of peptides bound to MHC molecules on the surface of cells. The activation of T cells requires the engagement of the TCR with antigen-MHC complexes on an antigen-presenting cell, a process that is facilitated by the presence of costimulatory molecules such as B7. The engagement of the TCR by antigen-MHC complexes stimulates a cascade of signaling events that ultimately lead to T cell proliferation and the expression of genes involved in T cell effector functions. The TCR is associated with the src family protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn, and the p36 family of proteins. The p36 family of proteins includes LAT, SLP-7 6 and FYB. The src kinases phosphorylate LAT and SLP-7 6, which in turn associate with the Tec family kinases Itk and Rlk. The Tec kinases activate PLC-gamma and the subsequent production of IP3 and DAG. IP3 leads to the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the activation of the calcium-dependent transcription factor NFAT. DAG activates the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAP kinase pathway and also the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. The activation of the Ras / Raf / MEK / MAP kinase pathway is independent of PKC activation. The activation of T cells requires costimulatory signals provided by the interaction of CD2 8 with its ligands on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The interaction of the T cell costimulatory molecule CTLA-4 with B7. 1 or B7. 2 inhibits T cell activation.",
  "Trefoil factors are small, secreted proteins with a unique trefoil structure. They are normally expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, but are also found in other tissues. Trefoil factors are up-regulated in response to mucosal damage and are thought to play a role in mucosal healing. They are also involved in mucosal protection and repair. The trefoil factor family has three members in mammals, TFF1, TFF2 and TFF3. TFF1 and TFF2 are expressed in the stomach, while TFF3 is expressed in the small and large intestine. TFF1 and TFF2 are involved in mucosal protection and repair, while TFF3 is involved in mucosal protection and repair in the intestine. Trefoil factors are also involved in tumor suppression. The trefoil factors are synthesized as precursors that are cleaved to the mature form. TFF1 and TFF2 are found in mucous granules in the gastric epithelium. TFF3 is secreted into the mucus layer of the intestine. The trefoil factors are not glycosylated, but are secreted via the constitutive secretory pathway. The trefoil factors are not cleaved from the mucous granules and are not degraded in the gastric lumen. The trefoil factors are not protease inhibitors, but act as intramolecular or intermolecular cross-linkers to form a network of mucin polymers. The trefoil factors also stimulate cell migration and proliferation. The trefoil factors are involved in mucosal protection and repair. The trefoil factors are also involved in tumor suppression.

  "T cells are key regulators of the immune system and respond to foreign antigens in the form of peptides bound to MHC proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. T cells are activated by the interaction of the T cell receptor with the antigen-MHC complex. The T cell receptor is a multi-subunit complex that includes a clonotypic alpha chain and a clonotypic beta or gamma chain associated with the CD3 complex. The clonotypic alpha and beta chains are responsible for binding the antigen-MHC complex and the CD3 complex transmits the activation signal to the T cell. The CD3 complex is composed of three dimers (gamma epsilon, delta epsilon, and zeta zeta) and is associated with the T cell receptor. The zeta chain is a key component of the T cell receptor complex and is required for the expression of the T cell receptor on the cell surface. The activation of the T cell receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The protein tyrosine phosphatase CD4 5 dephosphorylates the T cell receptor and other proteins involved in T cell activation to maintain T cell receptor signaling in the absence of antigen.",
  "Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is a complex organ-specific autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (Tg) and / or the TSH receptor (TSHR) are produced in genetically susceptible individuals. AITD is characterized by two phases: the initiation phase, in which self-reactive T cells are activated by self-antigen in the context of self-MHC-II molecules, and the effector phase, in which self-reactive B cells and T cells are expanded and differentiate into autoantibody-secreting plasma cells. The effector phase is characterized by the secretion of thyroid-reactive autoantibodies, which in the case of TPO and Tg leads to the production of thyroid autoantibodies that bind to and damage the thyroid. The destruction of the thyroid gland by thyroid autoantibodies leads to hypothyroidism. Graves' disease is characterized by the presence of thyroid-stimulating antibodies that stimulate the thyroid to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, resulting in hyperthyroidism.",
  "Mucins are large O-glycoproteins that are heavily O-glycosylated and are found on cell surfaces and in body fluids. Mucin O-glycans are synthesized by the stepwise transfer of monosaccharides to the serine or threonine residues of a polypeptide. The first monosaccharide to be added is N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which is then extended with monosaccharides that are specific for each of the different monosaccharides that may be found in O-glycans. The O-glycans of most mucins are branched and heterogeneous. Mucin O-glycans are important for many biological functions, including protection of epithelial cells from harmful agents, immune surveillance, and inflammation. Mucin O-glycans are synthesized by a process that is similar to the biosynthesis of other complex carbohydrates, with the addition of monosaccharides being catalyzed by a family of specific glycosyltransferases.",
  "Cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions are essential for many biological processes, including morphogenesis, cell motility, cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. At the cell-matrix adhesions, the integrin family of adhesion receptors mediates the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins consisting of noncovalently associated subunits, alpha and beta. The binding of ECM ligands to the extracellular domains of integrins triggers the formation of focal adhesions, which are large protein complexes that link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. The formation of focal adhesions is regulated by the small GTPases of the Rho family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc 4 2, which are activated by various signaling pathways. The activation of Rho induces the formation of contractile actin-based structures, such as stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas Rac and Cdc 4 2 induce the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, respectively. On the other hand, the inactivation of Rho induces the dissolution of focal adhesions. The integrin-mediated cell-cell adhesions are also called adherens junctions, and are mediated by E-cadherin. The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin interacts with beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is an actin-binding protein that may link the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. The tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) for growth factors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is required for the formation of adherens junctions. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin by RTKs dissociates beta-catenin from E-cadherin, thereby destabilizing adherens junctions.",
  "Tight junctions (TJs) are multiprotein structures that regulate the passage of ions and macromolecules between adjacent cells. They are essential for the maintenance of cell polarity and tissue integrity. They are formed by the association of transmembrane proteins, the occludins and the claudins, with cytoplasmic proteins, such as ZO-1, ZO-2 and cingulin. The cytoplasmic proteins are involved in the assembly of TJs and in the regulation of their function. The assembly of TJs is a highly dynamic process that is regulated by the cell cycle and by growth factors. The disassembly of TJs is associated with increased permeability and is triggered by tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1. The phosphorylation of ZO-1 and cingulin is mediated by Src and EGFR. The reassembly of TJs is a slower process that requires protein synthesis and dephosphorylation.",
  "The transcription factor NFAT is a key regulator of cytokine gene expression in T cells. In resting T cells, NFAT is phosphorylated and retained in the cytoplasm by binding to the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 protein. Activation of T cells by antigen results in the influx of calcium ions through the T cell receptor (TCR) and the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This leads to the activation of the phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to migrate into the nucleus and activate transcription. The activity of NFAT is regulated by a number of kinases, including GSK-3, which phosphorylates NFAT and promotes its binding to 14-3-3. Other kinases, including PKA, phosphorylate NFAT and cause it to be retained in the cytoplasm. The activity of PKA is regulated by the G-protein subunit alpha s (Gs), which stimulates the production of cAMP by adenylate cyclase. The production of cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates NFAT and causes it to be retained in the cytoplasm. The activity of NFAT is also regulated by the phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT and causes it to migrate into the nucleus. The activity of calcineurin is regulated by the calcium-binding protein calmodulin, which activates calcineurin when bound calcium levels rise in response to TCR activation.",
  "The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and motility. Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that bind to Frizzled receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5 / 6). This binding results in the stabilization of beta-catenin, which accumulates in the cytoplasm and is then translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus, beta-catenin interacts with the TCF / LEF family of transcription factors, resulting in the activation of Wnt target genes. Wnt signaling is involved in the genesis of a variety of human cancers. Mutations in APC or beta-catenin are associated with colon cancer, and mutations in beta-catenin are associated with melanoma. Wnt signaling is also involved in the development of other tissues, such as the central nervous system.",
  "Chemokines are small chemoattractant proteins that direct cell migration in both physiological and pathological processes. They are classified into four groups on the basis of their amino acid sequences. Chemokine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed on the surface of leukocytes. Chemokine receptors are classified into four groups on the basis of their structure and ligand specificity. The chemokine receptor group includes chemokine receptors that are specific for a single chemokine group. The chemokine receptor group that binds multiple chemokines includes the chemokine receptor group that binds multiple chemokines. The chemokine receptor group that does not bind chemokines includes the chemokine receptor CCR5.",
  "The immune system is comprised of a variety of cell types that work together to protect the body from invading pathogens and to respond to internal threats. B cells produce antibodies, T cells are the cells responsible for cellular immunity, and macrophages are the cells responsible for phagocytosis and the response to infection. B cells express antibodies that bind to and inactivate specific foreign antigens. T cells respond to specific antigens in the context of other proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, usually a macrophage or B cell. The T cell receptor recognizes specific antigens in the context of MHC proteins on the antigen-presenting cell. Macrophages and B cells are activated by the presence of antigen, and T cells are activated by the interaction of antigen-presenting cells with T cell receptors and costimulatory molecules.",
  "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells. The IL-2 receptor is a heterodimer of alpha and beta chains. The alpha chain is also a receptor for IL-4 and IL-1 3. The beta chain is shared by IL-2, IL-4 and IL-1 5. The beta chain is associated with the JAK family of tyrosine kinases and the STAT family of transcription factors. The JAK kinases are activated by phosphorylation by the IL-2 receptor and phosphorylate the beta chain and STAT-5. STAT-5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine by the JAK kinases and translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes including the IL-2 receptor alpha chain and the IL-2 receptor gamma chain. The JAK kinases are also involved in the activation of the Ras / Map kinase pathway by IL-2. The Map kinase pathway is activated by the JAK kinases and leads to the activation of the transcription factors ELK-1 and AP-1. The JAK kinases are also involved in other signaling pathways activated by IL-2.",
  "The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a multimeric complex that links the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. The DGC is required for the stability of the sarcolemma during muscle contraction and is also involved in signaling pathways that regulate gene expression and cell survival. The absence of the DGC in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) leads to membrane instability and muscle cell death. The loss of the DGC also affects the expression of other muscle proteins, including the acetylcholine receptor (AchR). The absence of the dystrophin protein in DMD results in the loss of the entire DGC from the sarcolemma. The loss of the DGC in DMD also affects the expression of other muscle proteins, including the AchR. The loss of the DGC in DMD also affects the expression of other muscle proteins, including the acetylcholine receptor (AchR). The loss of the DGC in DMD also affects the expression of other muscle proteins, including the acetylcholine receptor (AchR).

  "The protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their amino-terminal extracellular domain by the protease thrombin. The tethered peptide ligand that is unmasked by cleavage binds to and activates the receptor and thus the PAR is now considered a receptor for a protease. Four members of the PAR family have been identified and are activated by different proteases. The PAR-1 receptor is activated by thrombin, the PAR-2 receptor by trypsin, the PAR-3 by trypsin-like proteases such as tryptase and the PAR-4 by factor Xa. The tethered ligand sequence that activates the PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4 receptors is SFLLRN, GYPGQV and SLIGRL, respectively. PAR-2 is activated by a tethered ligand sequence of GYPGQV. The cleavage of PARs by proteases results in activation of G-proteins and downstream signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The PAR-1 and PAR-2 receptors are widely expressed in a variety of tissues and cells and are involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes including platelet activation, inflammation, and possibly cancer. The PAR-3 receptor is expressed in the central nervous system and may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease. The PAR-4 receptor is expressed in the intestinal epithelium and may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease.",
  "Type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease that results from the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells by self-reactive T cells. The genetic basis of IDDM is complex, with both environmental and genetic factors contributing to disease susceptibility. Environmental factors include diet, infections, and stress. Genetic factors include the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the insulin gene. The MHC is the most important genetic region in humans and mice. In humans, the MHC class II molecule encoded by the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 gene is associated with increased risk of IDDM. The insulin gene is also associated with IDDM in some populations. The pathogenesis of IDDM is thought to result from the destruction of beta cells by self-reactive T cells. Environmental factors may act by increasing the presentation of autoantigens by antigen-presenting cells, or by inducing T cell activation. In NOD mice, a model of IDDM, the disease is dependent on both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. CD4 + T cells are required for the activation of beta cell-specific CD8 + T cells. These T cells induce the expression of Fas ligand on beta cells, resulting in beta cell death by apoptosis. In addition to T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells may be involved in the activation of beta cell-specific T cells. Macrophages and dendritic cells are professional antigen-presenting cells that activate T cells. Macrophages and dendritic cells may also be involved in the activation of beta cell-specific T cells.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled form of cell death that is induced by a variety of stimuli and is essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis. The apoptotic program is executed by a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases, that are activated by two distinct proteolytic pathways. The first pathway is triggered by members of the TNF receptor gene family and results in the activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 in turn activates caspase-3, -6 and / or-7. The second pathway is triggered by the Bcl-2 family of proteins and results in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 to activate caspase-9. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, -6 and / or-7. The caspases are a class of cysteine proteases with conserved sequence motifs that include an amino-terminal death domain (DD), involved in protein-protein interactions, and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain. Caspases are separated into two groups based on their requirement for activation: the initiator caspases (caspases-2, -8, -9, -1 0) that are activated by oligomerization and the downstream caspases (caspases-3, -6, -7) that are activated by the initiator caspases. Caspases are expressed as inactive zymogens and are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases in the initiator group are activated by proximity-induced dimerization, while the downstream caspases are activated by proteolytic cleavage of the inactive zymogen. Caspases-8 and -9 are activated by the adaptor protein FADD (FAS-associated death domain protein), which is recruited to the receptor-signaling complex by the Fas-ligand or other death receptors. Caspase-8 cleaves and activates caspase-3, -6 and -7. Caspase-3 in turn cleaves a number of cellular substrates, including the nuclear enzyme DFF-4 5, which is required for chromatin condensation and the enzyme lamin-B, which is required for nuclear fragmentation during apoptosis. Caspase-3 also cleaves Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, which translocates to mitochondria and induces the release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3. Caspases-1 and -4 are activated by the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta and IL-18, respectively, and are involved in the inflammatory response. Caspases-2 and-8 are involved in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, but their activation is not required for apoptosis. Caspases-3, -6 and-7 are involved in the execution of apoptosis.",
  "The amino acid methionine is an essential amino acid for animals and is synthesized from aspartate in bacteria, plants, and fungi. The enzyme methionine synthase (MS) catalyzes the reaction. converting tetrahydrofolate (THF) with methionine and homocysteine to THF and methionine. The methyl group of methionine is donated to the methyl group of dUMP in DNA for methylation. The enzyme MS is a key enzyme in one-carbon metabolism. The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) catalyzes the irreversible methylation of glycine to form sarcosine. Sarcosine is excreted in the urine of humans and other animals. Sarcosine is a methyl donor in the synthesis of creatine, which is used as an energy buffer in muscles.",
  "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing beta cells are destroyed by self-reactive T cells. The disease is associated with the presence of islet-cell autoantibodies that recognize beta-cell antigens. The disease is genetically complex, with the inheritance of multiple susceptibility genes. The autoimmune response is T-helper 1 (Th1) -cell-mediated, with the secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and the cytotoxic action of CD8 + T cells. The major genetic determinant of T1DM is the MHC class II molecule, HLA-DQB1 * 0 3 0 2. Other MHC genes, such as HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1, are also associated with T1DM. Environmental factors, such as viral infections, may trigger the autoimmune process. Viral infections may activate self-reactive T cells by molecular mimicry, in which self-proteins are recognized by T cells that are specific for viral proteins. Viral infections may also induce the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps), which are also self-antigens, in beta cells. Viral infections may also induce the expression of stress proteins, such as glucose-regulated proteins (Grps), in beta cells. Grps are induced by a variety of environmental stresses, including viral infections. Viral infection may also induce the expression of stress proteins in beta cells. The induction of Hsps and Grps may result in the formation of abnormal proteins in beta cells, which are then targeted by the immune system.",
  "The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. It binds to retinoic acid (RA) and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. The RAR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds to RA response elements in the promoter regions of target genes. The RAR is found in two forms, RAR alpha and RAR beta. The RAR is found in a complex with a number of proteins that regulate its activity. One of these proteins is the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR). N-CoR binds to the RAR in the absence of ligand and represses transcription. Upon binding of RA to the RAR, the N-CoR is dissociated and the RAR is able to activate transcription. Another protein that binds to the RAR is the transcriptional coactivator protein SRC-1. Binding of RA to the RAR causes the dissociation of the N-CoR and the recruitment of SRC-1 to the RAR. SRC-1 binds to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and other steroid hormone receptors and increases the transcriptional activity of these receptors. The binding of RA to the RAR causes a conformational change in the RAR that allows the binding of SRC-1. The binding of SRC-1 to the RAR causes a conformational change in the RAR that allows the binding of CBP / pCIP to the RAR. CBP / pCIP is a histone acetylase that relaxes the chromatin structure and allows the transcriptional machinery to access the DNA. The binding of RA to the RAR causes the dissociation of N-CoR and the recruitment of SRC-1 and CBP / pCIP to the RAR. The binding of RA to the RAR causes a conformational change in the RAR that allows the binding of CBP / pCIP and causes the dissociation of N-CoR. The binding of CBP / pCIP to the RAR causes a conformational change that allows the binding of SRC-1.",
  "The chemokine IL-8 is a member of the C-X-C family of chemotactic cytokines that induce the migration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes to sites of inflammation. IL-8 is secreted by airway epithelial cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, including bacterial products, cytokines, and environmental irritants. IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and is a key mediator of inflammation. IL-8 is a member of the CXC chemokine family that also includes IP-1 0, ENA-7 8, and GRO-alpha. The CXC chemokines are distinguished from the C-X-C chemokines by the presence of a conserved glutamic acid-leucine (EL) motif adjacent to the N-terminus that is absent in the C-X-C chemokines. The ELR motif is essential for the angiogenic activity of IL-8. The receptor for IL-8 is a G-protein coupled receptor that signals through the MAP kinase and NF-kB pathways to activate transcription of genes involved in inflammation and chemotaxis. The receptor for IL-8 is a heterodimer of CXCR1 and CXCR2. The affinity of CXCR2 for IL-8 is greater than CXCR1, but the expression level of CXCR2 is much higher than CXCR1 in neutrophils. The expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on neutrophils is regulated by inflammatory stimuli. IL-8 is a key mediator of inflammation and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.",
  "Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in the control of translation. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) is a key translation factor that regulates the initiation of protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of eIF-2 by protein kinases inhibits eIF-2 and protein synthesis. Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) are involved in the dephosphorylation of eIF-2 and the reversal of the inhibition of protein synthesis. The activity of eIF-2 is regulated by phosphorylation of a specific subunit, eIF-2 alpha. eIF-2 alpha kinase (PKR) is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and phosphorylates eIF-2 alpha. PKR is also activated by hemin deficiency, a condition that occurs during cellular stress. Activated PKR phosphorylates eIF-2 alpha, inhibiting eIF-2 and protein synthesis. PP1 and PP2A are involved in the dephosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha. PP1 dephosphorylates eIF-2 alpha and activates eIF-2 and protein synthesis. PP2A dephosphorylates eIF-2 alpha and inactivates eIF-2 and protein synthesis.",
  "Insulin resistance is a common feature of type II diabetes. The development of insulin resistance is associated with a decrease in the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle accounts for more than half of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into skeletal muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. The development of insulin resistance is associated with defects in insulin signaling. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase pathway plays a key role in insulin signaling. Binding of insulin to its receptor activates the receptor tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates downstream substrates including the insulin receptor substrates (IRS). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins bind to and activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. PI3K phosphorylates the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5 P2), which in turn activates the serine / threonine kinase AKT. AKT phosphorylates and activates the Rab-GAP protein AS1 6 0, which inhibits GLUT4 translocation. AKT also phosphorylates and inhibits the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, which promotes GLUT4 translocation. Another substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is Shc, which activates the Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The Ras-dependent MAPK pathway also contributes to the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin. The serine / threonine kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a downstream target of the PI3K pathway and a key regulator of protein synthesis. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, blocks the stimulation of protein synthesis by insulin and other growth factors. Rapamycin also blocks the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin, indicating that mTOR is involved in insulin signaling.",
  "The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, ephrins, are involved in the guidance of neuronal and vascular development. The ephrins are tethered to the cell surface by a GPI anchor, but can also be cleaved and released as soluble factors. The Eph receptors are tethered to the cell surface by a transmembrane domain, and are therefore able to transduce signals in both directions across the plasma membrane. The ephrins are tethered to the extracellular matrix or other cells by a second membrane-spanning domain.

  "The rolling of leukocytes along the vascular endothelium is an essential step in the inflammatory response. This process is mediated by the interaction of the leukocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) with its endothelial counter-receptor ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1). The rolling leukocytes are then activated to adhere to the endothelium and migrate into the tissue in a process known as firm adhesion. The firm adhesion of leukocytes is mediated by the interaction of Mac-1 (macrophage-1 antigen) with its endothelial counter-receptor, ICAM-1. The rolling and firm adhesion of leukocytes is mediated by a series of adhesion molecules on the surface of the leukocytes and the vascular endothelium. The interaction of the selectins with their counter-receptors on the vascular endothelium initiates the rolling of leukocytes along the endothelium. The interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 mediates the rolling of leukocytes. The firm adhesion of leukocytes is mediated by the interaction of Mac-1 with ICAM-1. The interaction of P-selectin on the vascular endothelium with its ligand on the leukocyte, PSGL-1, is also involved in the rolling of leukocytes. The rolling of leukocytes along the vascular endothelium is followed by their firm adhesion and migration into the tissue. The interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 is required for the firm adhesion of leukocytes. The interaction of Mac-1 and ICAM-1 is required for the migration of leukocytes into the tissue. The interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 is inhibited by the interaction of PSGL-1 with P-selectin.",
  "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved mechanism that removes base-pair mismatches and insertion-deletion loops (IDLs) generated during DNA replication. MMR corrects replication errors that escape DNA polymerases proofreading activity. MMR also plays a role in other DNA transactions, including DNA damage signaling and recombination. Defects in MMR genes are associated with genome instability and predisposition to certain types of cancer. MMR proteins are classified into three groups: 1) MutS homologs (MSH), 2) MutL homologs (MLH), and 3) exonuclease I (EXOI). MSH2 and MSH6 (hMutS) form a heterodimer that recognizes mismatches and recruits MLH1 and PMS2 (hMutL\u03b1) to the mismatch. MLH1 and PMS2 form a heterodimer that is also recruited by MSH proteins. The recruitment of these complexes by the MSH complex activates the exonucleolytic activity of EXOI, which excises the error-containing strand and then uses the intact strand as a template for repair synthesis. After repair synthesis, the single-stranded gap is filled by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase.",
  "The Krebs cycle is a central metabolic pathway that produces NADH and FADH for use in oxidative phosphorylation. The Krebs cycle also produces precursors for amino acids, fatty acids and other metabolites. The cycle begins with the conversion of acetyl-CoA to citrate by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Citrate is converted to isocitrate by citrate synthase. Isocitrate is converted to alpha-ketoglutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase. The Krebs cycle then proceeds through a series of reactions to convert alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, which is then converted to fumarate by a series of reactions. Fumarate is converted to malate by malate dehydrogenase. Finally, malate is converted to pyruvate by the enzyme malic enzyme. The pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase. The acetyl-CoA is converted to citrate by citrate synthase. The cycle continues with the conversion of acetyl-CoA to the Krebs cycle intermediate, alpha-ketoglutarate. The cycle ends with the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate by succinyl-CoA synthetase. Succinate is converted to fumarate by fumarate hydratase. The cycle ends with the conversion of malate to pyruvate by malic enzyme. The cycle is completed with the conversion of NADH to NAD + by the electron transport chain. The cycle is completed in four steps each cycle. The cycle begins with acetyl-CoA, which is converted to citrate by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The next cycle step is the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase. The next cycle step is the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate by succinyl-CoA synthetase. The next step is the conversion of fumarate to malate by fumarate hydratase. The next step is the conversion of malate to pyruvate by malic enzyme. The cycle ends with the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase. The cycle is completed with the conversion of NADH to NAD + by the electron transport chain. The cycle completes each cycle by converting NADH to NAD +. The cycle ends with the conversion of pyruvate to succinyl-CoA by succinyl-CoA synthetase. The cycle completes each cycle by converting succinyl-CoA to succinate by succinyl-CoA synthetase.",
  "The sense of taste is initiated by the perception of a tastant by taste receptor cells (TRCs). TRCs are classified into two types, bitter-sensitive (type II) and umami-sensitive (type III) TRCs. Bitter-sensitive TRCs respond to a variety of bitter compounds, including toxins, whereas umami-sensitive TRCs respond to monosodium glutamate (MSG) and MSG-containing foods. Bitter and umami taste are detected by membrane-bound taste receptors, T2Rs and mGluRs, respectively. Bitter taste receptors are GPCRs coupled to gustducin, a G protein alpha-subunit, which activates the downstream signaling cascade. Umami taste receptors are GPCRs that are coupled to the G protein, Gq. Downstream signaling by mGluRs leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to produce inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium (Ca2 +) from this organelle. Ca2 + then flows into the cytosol through IP3 receptors and / or the calcium release-activated calcium channel (CRAC). Ca2 + is an important second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular functions. Ca2 + influx through CRAC channels activates the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger, which exports Na + and imports Ca2 +. The resulting increase in intracellular Ca2 + activates the Ca2 + -activated chloride channel, which depolarizes the plasma membrane and opens the transduction channels of the TRC. TRC depolarization activates the transduction channels in primary afferent fibers, which convey the taste signal to the brain.",
  "The ets family of transcription factors is defined by the presence of a conserved DNA binding domain, the ETS domain, that recognizes a core sequence 5 '-GGAA / T-3'. The ets family is comprised of more than 3 0 genes in mammals and is involved in a variety of developmental processes and cellular functions. The ets-family genes are further divided into subfamilies based on the similarity of the ETS domain and the non-conserved flanking sequences. The ets- subfamily genes include PU.1, Spi-1 / PU.1, Erg, Fli-1, Ets2, Elf-1, NERF, Tle-1, Tal-1, and Er8 1. The ets-family genes are involved in a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and transformation. The activity of the ets-family genes is regulated by a variety of mechanisms including autoregulation, post-translational modification, and interaction with other transcription factors. The interaction of ets-family genes with other transcription factors is often cooperative and leads to the activation or repression of target genes. The cooperative interactions between ets-family genes and other transcription factors are often mediated by the recruitment of coactivators or corepressors to the target promoters. The coactivators include CBP / p30 0, p300-CBP associated factor, and p160 / SRC-1. Corepressors include mSin3A, N-CoR, and SMRT. The recruitment of coactivators or corepressors by transcription factors often involves the use of a LxxL motif to interact with a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the transcription factor. The LxxL motif is found in a variety of transcription factors including the ets-family genes Fli-1, Ets2, and PU.1. The LxxL motif is also found in the corepressor NCoR and SMRT. The interaction of the ets-family genes with coactivators and corepressors is often regulated by post-translational modification of the transcription factors. The interaction of PU.1 with CBP / p30 0 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of threonine-5 7 2 by the kinase p38.

  "Calpain is a calcium-dependent protease that is involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cell motility and adhesion. Calpain is a heterodimer, consisting of a large catalytic subunit (8 0kDa) and a small regulatory subunit (30kDa). The large subunit contains the protease active site, and the small subunit is involved in calcium binding and membrane localization. Calpain is activated by calcium binding to the regulatory subunit, and is inhibited by the binding of calpastatin to the large subunit. Calpain cleaves a variety of substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins. Calpain activity is regulated by phosphorylation, and by the presence of other proteins that interact with calpain. The large subunit of calpain is encoded by a single gene, CAPN1, which is alternatively spliced to produce four different isoforms. The small subunit is encoded by a separate gene, CAPN2. Calpain is localized in the cytosol in a quiescent state, but is recruited to the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton by calcium binding. Membrane localization of calpain is mediated by interaction with the cytoskeletal protein spectrin, and by interaction with the membrane protein talin. Talin is involved in cell adhesion and integrin signaling, and calpain cleaves talin to regulate cell adhesion. The calpain substrate beta-catenin is involved in cell adhesion, and cleavage of beta-catenin by calpain disrupts cell adhesion. Paxillin is another cytoskeletal protein involved in cell adhesion that is cleaved by calpain. Calpain also cleaves the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), disrupting focal adhesions and cell motility. Calpain also cleaves Rac and Rho, two small GTPases involved in cell motility, to regulate cell motility. Calpain activity is inhibited by the binding of calpastatin to the large subunit of calpain, and by the binding of the small subunit to the regulatory subunit. The binding of the regulatory subunit to the small subunit is inhibited by the binding of the inhibitory domain of calpastatin to the large subunit. The activity of calpain is also regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of calpain by protein kinase C inhibits calpain activity. The activity of calpain is also regulated by the calcium binding protein 36kDa (36k). The 36kDa protein is a calcium binding protein that is localized to the membrane and cytoskeleton, and is involved in the regulation of calpain activity. The activity of 36kDa is inhibited by the binding of calpastatin to the large subunit of calpain, and is activated by the binding of 36kDa to the small subunit.",
  "The activation of macrophages by bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is essential for the innate immune response to infection. LPS activates macrophages through a receptor complex containing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the CD1 4 coreceptor. LPS binding to the receptor complex activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including the NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcription factors, which lead to the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses.",
  "Vasopressin (AVP) is a nonapeptide hormone that regulates water homeostasis by increasing water intake and decreasing water excretion in the kidneys and the colon. AVP is released into the circulation by the pituitary in response to increased plasma osmolality or decreased blood volume. In the kidney, AVP binds to V2 receptors in the collecting duct cells, increasing cAMP levels and activating the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. This in turn leads to phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and its insertion into the apical plasma membrane, increasing water permeability and promoting water excretion into the urinary bladder. In addition to this short-term regulation, AVP also regulates AQP2 expression at the transcriptional level. In the kidney, long-term exposure to high levels of AVP results in increased AQP2 expression and the development of water-imbalance disorders such as diabetes insipidus. In the rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD), AVP increases AQP2 expression by increasing the half-life of AQP2 mRNA. In addition to AQP2, AVP also regulates the expression of other proteins involved in water transport, including the Na + / K + -ATPase and the Na + / H + exchanger.",
  "Cardiac muscle contraction is triggered by the influx of extracellular calcium ions (Ca (2 +)) through voltage-gated L-type Ca (2 +) channels (LCCs) in the sarcolemmal (SL) membrane. The resulting increase in intracellular Ca (2 +) (Ca (2 +)) triggers the release of Ca (2 +) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca (2 +) release channels (CRSs). The Ca (2 +) that activates the contractile proteins is mainly derived from the release of SR Ca (2 +). This is called the Ca (2 +) -induced Ca (2 +) release mechanism. The Ca (2 +) that activates the contractile proteins is pumped out of the cell by the SR Ca (2 +) -ATPase (SERCA) and the Na (+) / Ca (2 +) exchanger (NCX). The amount of Ca (2 +) that enters the cell via the LCC is determined by the balance between Ca (2 +) influx through the LCC and Ca (2 +) removal via the SERCA and NCX. The Ca (2 +) that enters the cell is buffered by intracellular Ca (2 +) -binding proteins and is returned to the extracellular space via the NCX. The Ca (2 +) that enters the cell via the LCC is also pumped out of the cell by the SERCA in a manner that depends on the preceding Ca (2 +) removal rate. This is known as the Ca (2 +) -induced Ca (2 +) release mechanism. The Ca (2 +) that enters the cell via the NCX is pumped out of the cell by the same mechanism.",
  "The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. The VDR binds to the vitamin D response element (VDRE) in the promoter region of target genes and regulates their transcription in a ligand-dependent manner. The ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of the VDR is regulated by a variety of coregulators. The SWI / SNF complex is one of the best characterized coregulators. The SWI / SNF complex uses the energy of ATP to alter the structure of chromatin and facilitate the binding of transcription factors to nucleosomal DNA. The SWI / SNF complex is composed of at least nine subunits, including BRG1 or hBRM as the ATPase subunit. The SWI / SNF complex interacts with a large number of transcription factors and coregulators to regulate their transcriptional activity. The p300 subunit interacts directly with the VDR and is required for the transcriptional activity of the VDR. The histone acetylase (HAT) activity of coactivators also plays an important role in transcriptional regulation. The p300 subunit interacts directly with CBP and p300-CBP interaction is required for the transcriptional activity of the VDR. The coactivators such as SRC-1 and CBP / p300 also possess histone acetylase activity. The vitamin D receptor-interacting protein (DRIP) complex is another coactivator complex that interacts with the VDR. The DRIP complex interacts with the basal transcriptional machinery and functions as a bridge between transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II.",
  "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a peptide hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis. Ang II is formed from the cleavage of the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) by the enzyme renin. Ang II is a potent vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure by increasing vascular resistance. Ang II also has a number of other actions including the regulation of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland, sodium retention by the kidneys, and the regulation of sodium balance in the heart and brain. Ang II is formed in the heart and blood vessels from the conversion of circulating inactive AGT by the enzyme ACE. ACE is a zinc peptidase that is anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. ACE is found in high concentrations in the lungs and at lower concentrations in the kidneys, heart, and blood vessels. Ang II is formed in the heart and blood vessels from the cleavage of circulating AGT by ACE. ACE inhibitors block the formation of Ang II and are used to treat hypertension and heart failure. ACE is also found in the testes and may play a role in the regulation of fertility. Ang II is a substrate for the enzyme chymase, which is found in high concentrations in the heart and in the lungs. ACE inhibitors do not cross the blood brain barrier and do not affect brain function. The ACE gene has been mapped to chromosome 1 7q2 3. 3 and is a single copy gene. The ACE gene has been cloned and sequenced and found to contain 2 6 exons. The ACE gene is regulated by two promoters and by alternative splicing of the ACE mRNA. The kidney and lungs are the main sites of ACE synthesis. The kidney is the main site of degradation of Ang II. ACE inhibitors block the degradation of Ang II in the circulation but do not cross the blood brain barrier and do not affect brain function. The second enzyme involved in the formation of Ang II is chymase. Chymase is a serine protease that is found in high concentrations in the heart and in the heart valves. Chymase is a zinc protease that is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors. Chymase is not inhibited by the ACE inhibitor chymostatin. Ang II is not formed from AGT by chymase. The heart and blood vessels are the main sites of Ang II formation from AGT by chymase. ACE inhibitors do not cross the blood brain barrier and do not affect brain function.",
  "Bladder cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in men in the United States. Approximately 7 5% of bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas (TCC). The majority of bladder cancers are superficial, papillary tumors that are treated by transurethral resection. Approximately 3 0% of patients with superficial bladder cancer will develop muscle invasive disease. The 5-year survival rate for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer is less than 5 0%. The molecular pathogenesis of bladder cancer is complex and involves the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The most common genetic alterations in bladder cancer are in the p53, RAS, RB, and EGF receptor pathways.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a polypeptide hormone with structural and functional similarities to insulin. IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a tyrosine kinase receptor, and activates multiple signaling pathways that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. IGF-1 is an important mediator of growth and development, and is also implicated in the development of cancer. IGF-1R is widely expressed in many tissues, and its expression is increased in many cancers. IGF-1R signaling activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which leads to activation of AKT and mTOR. AKT phosphorylates and inhibits the activity of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, which regulates expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p2 7Kip1. mTOR also regulates translation by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP) and the 7 0 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP releases the initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E), which binds to eIF-4G to form the eIF-4F complex that binds to the 5 'cap of mRNA and facilitates translation initiation. eIF-4F also binds to the poly (A) binding protein (PABP), which interacts with the poly (A) tail of mRNA and facilitates ribosome scanning and translation initiation. AKT also phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), which phosphorylates and activates eIF4B. Phosphorylation of eIF4B and p70S6K increases the translation of mRNAs with a complex 5' cap.",
  "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the structurally related pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are neuropeptides widely expressed in the nervous system and in peripheral tissues. They exert a broad spectrum of biological actions, including regulation of hormone secretion, neuronal transmission, immune functions, and cell proliferation. The biological actions of VIP and PACAP are mediated by the interaction with specific receptors, VPAC and PAC, which are coupled to Gs and Gq / 1 1 proteins, respectively. The activation of these G proteins stimulates the adenylate cyclase and the phospholipase C pathways. Both pathways lead to the activation of protein kinase A and C, which in turn activate several transcription factors, including CREB, NF-AT, and NF-kB. VIP and PACAP exert a potent growth-regulatory activity, inhibiting the proliferation of normal and transformed cells. The growth-inhibitory activity of VIP and PACAP is mediated by the activation of the p35-15 kinase and the subsequent induction of the p190-1 4 2 / RB-0 5 0 / RB-0 2 0 tumor suppressor gene. The induction of RB-0 5 0 / RB-0 2 0 leads to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases and the consequent cell cycle arrest.",
  "The cell cycle is a series of events that result in the duplication of DNA and the partitioning of chromosomes between the two daughter cells. The cell cycle is regulated by a series of checkpoints that prevent the cell from progressing through the cycle if conditions are not right. The G1 / S checkpoint prevents the cell from entering S phase if conditions are not right. The G2 / M checkpoint prevents the cell from entering mitosis if conditions are not right. The intra-S phase checkpoint prevents the cell from entering S phase if conditions are not right. The G2 / M transition is regulated by the activation of the cyclin dependent kinase Cdc2. The activity of Cdc2 is regulated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 1 5 by the kinases Wee1 and Mik1. The activation of the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 in response to DNA damage results in the phosphorylation and inhibition of Cdc2 5C, the phosphatase that dephosphorylates Cdc2. The activation of the DNA damage checkpoint also results in the inhibition of the transcription of a number of genes involved in DNA replication, including cyclin A and Cdc25A. The inhibition of cyclin A transcription results in the inhibition of the activation of the cyclin E-cdk2 complex, which is required for the G1 / S transition. The inhibition of Cdc25A transcription results in the inhibition of the activation of the checkpoint kinase chk1, which is required for the activation of the G2 / M checkpoint.",

  "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the catalytic component of the gamma-secretase complex that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid-beta (Abeta). Presenilin-1 is also involved in the cleavage of Notch, a transmembrane receptor involved in development and differentiation. Presenilin-1 is a polytopic membrane protein with six transmembrane domains. The N-terminus of PS1 is in the lumen and the C-terminus is in the cytoplasm. The catalytic site of gamma-secretase resides within the transmembrane domain of Presenilin-1. The cleavage of APP and Notch by gamma-secretase releases the C-terminal fragment (CTF) and the N-terminal fragment (NTF). The CTFs are further processed by gamma-secretase to release the Abeta peptide and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), respectively. The APP intracellular domain (AICD) translocates to the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional coactivator of the transcription factor CEBP-1.

  "T cell activation is a key event in the adaptive immune response. T cell activation requires two signals, the first signal provided by the T cell receptor (TCR) complex and the second signal provided by costimulatory molecules. Engagement of the TCR by peptide-MHC complexes triggers the activation of several signaling cascades. The TCR-CD3 complex is associated with several adaptor proteins, including LAT, SLP-7 6, and GADS, which activate multiple downstream signaling pathways. The engagement of costimulatory molecules such as CD28 leads to the activation of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the protein kinase p38. The activation of these pathways results in the production of second messengers, such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3), which activate the protein kinase C (PKC) and the calcium-dependent calcineurin pathways, respectively. These pathways lead to the activation of transcription factors such as NFAT and AP-1, which regulate the expression of genes involved in T cell activation and differentiation.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members are secreted proteins that regulate a wide variety of cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix production. The TGF-beta signaling pathway is complex and involves the interaction of type I and type II serine / threonine kinase receptors. Binding of ligand to the type II receptor recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates downstream effectors, including receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3. The phosphorylated R-Smads associate with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and the heteromeric complex is transported into the nucleus to regulate transcription. Inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, modulate signaling by interfering with R-Smad phosphorylation or by recruiting ubiquitin ligases to the type I receptor to promote its degradation.",

  "The TNF receptor superfamily contains more than 10 0 members in the human genome and is involved in the regulation of immune responses, apoptosis, and other cellular processes. The receptors in this family are characterized by the presence of a cytoplasmic domain termed the death domain (DD). The DD is a protein-protein interaction domain that is found in a variety of signaling molecules, including the TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1), Fas, and the DD containing proteins FADD and TRADD. The binding of TNF to its receptor TNFR1 recruits the DD-containing adaptor protein TRADD to the receptor complex. TRADD in turn recruits the DD-containing kinase RIP to the receptor complex. RIP is involved in the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways downstream of TNFR1. TRADD also interacts with the DD-containing protein FADD, which recruits the protease caspase-8 to the receptor complex. Recruitment of caspase-8 to the receptor complex results in its activation, and the subsequent cleavage and activation of caspase-3 and other apoptotic factors. Caspase-8 also cleaves Bid, a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, to induce apoptosis. The interaction of TRADD with FADD and caspase-8 is critical for the induction of apoptosis by TNFR1. The interaction of TRADD with RIP may also play a role in the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways by TNFR1. The interaction of TRADD with the Fas receptor and FADD is required for Fas-induced apoptosis. The interaction of TRADD with TNFR1 and Fas may be regulated by the cellular protein Daxx, which interacts with the DD of TRADD. The interaction of TRADD with TNFR1 and Fas may also play a role in the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways by TNFR1 and Fas.",
  "The peptide hormone endothelin (ET) is a potent vasoconstrictor that also acts as a mitogen for a variety of cell types. The 2 1-amino acid ET peptide is derived from a larger precursor, big ET, by the action of the endothelin converting enzyme (ECE-1). ET is produced by the vascular endothelium and is a potent vasoconstrictor. ET has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis. ET also has mitogenic properties and may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. ET has been localized in atherosclerotic plaques and may be involved in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) that occurs in these lesions. ET may also play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and renal disease. ET has been shown to stimulate proliferation of VSMC through both ETa and ETb receptors. The mitogenic effects of ET are mediated through activation of protein kinase C and the MAP kinase pathway. ET also activates the transcription factor NF-kB, which may play a role in the mitogenic effects of ET. ET also activates the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun through the AP-1 transcription factor. The activation of c-fos and c-jun by ET may play a role in the mitogenic effects of ET. ET also activates the EGFR through a PKC-dependent mechanism. The EGFR may play a role in the activation of c-fos and c-jun by ET. The activation of the EGFR by ET may also play a role in the mitogenic effects of ET.",
  "The immune system is composed of two major components, the cellular compartment (leukocytes) and the humoral compartment (antibodies).

Th cells secrete cytokines that stimulate and regulate the immune response, while Tc cells mediate cellular immunity through the release of cytotoxic granules.",
  "Oxidative stress is a condition in which the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelms the antioxidant capacity of cells. ROS include free radicals such as superoxide (O2 -), hydroxyl (OH), and peroxyl (ROO -), as well as nonradical oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ROS are generated as by-products of normal cellular metabolism, including the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and by exogenous sources such as environmental toxins, xenobiotics, and inflammatory stimuli. Cells have a variety of defense mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress, including the glutathione (GSH) system, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GSR). GSH is a tripeptide consisting of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine that acts as a major intracellular antioxidant. The reduced form of glutathione (GSH) is used to reduce ROS, while oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is used to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG). The GSH / GSSG ratio is an indicator of the cellular redox state. When the GSH / GSSG ratio is low, ROS levels increase and oxidative stress occurs. ROS can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to cell death. The transcription factor NF-kB is activated by oxidative stress and regulates the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, proliferation, and inflammation. NF-kB is a heterodimer consisting of p5 0 and p6 5 subunits. Normally, NF-kB is bound to its inhibitor, IkB, in the cytosol. Upon activation by oxidative stress, IkB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The chemokine CXCL8 is a member of the C-X-C motif chemokine family and is involved in inflammation, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis. CXCL8 is upregulated by oxidative stress and NF-kB. The transcription factor Nrf2 regulates the expression of antioxidant genes, including glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), NAD (P) H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC). Nrf2 is bound to the cytoplasmic repressor protein, Keap1, under normal conditions. Upon oxidative stress, Keap1 is modified, releasing Nrf2, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription.",
  "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and immune deficiency. The gene responsible for WAS encodes WASP, a protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton. WASP is expressed in hematopoietic cells and interacts with several proteins involved in signal transduction and actin cytoskeletal regulation. The N-terminal region of WASP binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex, which is involved in actin nucleation and branching. The C-terminal region of WASP contains a verprolin-homology domain, a cofilin-like domain, and an acidic region. The verprolin-homology domain binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex and stimulates actin nucleation. The cofilin-like domain binds to actin monomers and may promote actin depolymerization. The acidic region of WASP interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex and with the signaling protein Cdc4 2. Interaction of Cdc4 2 with WASP stimulates the formation of branched actin networks, which may provide a force for membrane protrusion and cell motility. The interaction of WASP with the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Cdc4 2, 3BP-1, may provide a feedback loop to down-regulate Cdc4 2 signaling. The interaction of WASP with the adaptor protein Nck may link WASP to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by tyrosine phosphorylation. The interaction of WASP with the adaptor protein Nck may also link WASP to signaling pathways involving the actin cytoskeleton.",
  "The mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is activated by a variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, cellular stress, and antigen receptor engagement.

Activated MAPKs translocate to the nucleus and activate various transcription factors, including ELK-1, c-Myc, and NF-kB.",
  "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a myocardial disease characterised by dilatation and impaired systolic function of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure. The clinical course is variable and may be sudden and fatal. Familial forms of DCM account for approximately 1 0% of cases and are caused by mutations in one of several genes that encode proteins of the cardiac sarcomere, the cytoskeleton, the sarcolemma, the nuclear envelope, or the nuclear membrane. The identification of the genetic basis of familial DCM has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of this condition. In some cases, mutations in genes encoding cytoskeletal and membrane proteins cause a primary abnormality of force transmission, whereas in other cases, defects in proteins involved in force generation lead to compensatory hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart.",
  "The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by the endogenous opioid peptide, morphine. The MOR is involved in the analgesic effects of morphine, as well as the development of tolerance to morphine. The MOR is also involved in the rewarding effects of morphine, as well as the development of dependence. The MOR is phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins, which leads to receptor desensitization and internalization. The receptor is also regulated by other post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and sumoylation. The MOR is also regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The MOR is found in both the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, and its trafficking between these locations is regulated by different post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. The MOR is also regulated by other GPCRs, such as the delta opioid receptor (DOR). The DOR is able to regulate MOR signaling and trafficking, and this regulation may be involved in the development of tolerance to morphine. The MOR is also regulated by other GPCRs, such as the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). The KOR is able to regulate MOR signaling and trafficking, and this regulation may be involved in the development of tolerance to morphine.

The spliceosome is a dynamic structure, with multiple conformations adopted by the spliceosome during the splicing reaction.",
  "Leptin is a 1 67 amino acid peptide secreted by adipose tissue that regulates energy balance by acting in the hypothalamus to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. Leptin acts through a receptor that is part of the cytokine receptor family. Leptin binding to the receptor activates the JAK / STAT pathway, which in turn activates transcription of genes involved in energy balance. Leptin also activates the PI-3 kinase / Akt pathway, which may contribute to the regulation of energy balance by leptin. Leptin also appears to act directly on the hypothalamus to reduce food intake. The melanocortin system in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is a key component of the pathway by which leptin regulates energy balance. Binding of leptin to the leptin receptor activates JAK2, which phosphorylates and activates STAT3, a transcription factor that is translocated to the nucleus and activates genes involved in energy balance. The melanocortin receptors are G-protein coupled receptors and activation of these receptors activates the melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. The activity of the melanocortin system is regulated by the prohormone convertase enzyme PC1, which cleaves proopiomelanocortin (POMC) to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and beta-endorphin. PC1 is inhibited by feeding and activated by fasting, providing a mechanism by which the amount of food eaten can be regulated by the state of the body. The activity of the melanocortin system is also regulated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which cleaves off the N-terminal dipeptide from alpha-MSH. DPP-IV activity is increased by fasting and inhibits alpha-MSH activity, reducing the activity of the melanocortin system and increasing food intake. The activity of DPP-IV is inhibited by the drug sitagliptin, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, and may be a useful treatment for obesity.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is responsible for the recognition of foreign antigen by T cells. The TCR is a heterodimer of two transmembrane polypeptides, alpha and beta, each of which is associated with the CD3 complex. The CD3 complex is composed of gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta1, 2 transmembrane polypeptides. The zeta and epsilon chains are invariant chains that are expressed at a 1: 1ratio with the TCR alpha and beta chains. The gamma and delta chains are expressed with the TCR in a variety of different cell types but are not found in the TCR complex on mature T cells. The zeta and epsilon chains are expressed at a 100 0fold higher level than the alpha and beta chains. The CD3 chains are essential for the assembly and transport of the TCR complex to the cell surface. The zeta chain is required for the surface expression of the TCR complex. The CD3 chains are also essential for the coupling of the TCR to intracellular signaling pathways. The association of the TCR with the CD3 complex is required for the proper expression and function of the TCR. The association of the TCR with the CD3 complex also increases the avidity of the TCR for antigen-MHC complex. The CD80 and CD86 molecules are members of the immunoglobulin gene family and are expressed on the surface of activated T cells and some B cells. CD80 and CD86 are ligands for the T cell coreceptor molecule, CD28. The binding of CD28 to CD30 on the same cell or a neighboring cell increases the sensitivity of the T cell to antigen. CD80 and CD86 are differentially expressed on T cells and their expression is regulated by cytokines.",
  "The Raf / MEK / ERK pathway is a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. It is activated by a variety of factors including growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stress. The Raf kinases are MAPKKKs that activate the MEK1 / 2 kinases, which in turn activate the ERKs. The ERKs phosphorylate transcription factors such as ELK-1 and CREB that regulate genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. The p38 kinases are also activated by the ERKs and regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis. The p38 kinases are activated by cellular stress such as UV radiation and heat shock and also by cytokines such as IL-1\u00df. The p38 kinases phosphorylate the Bcl2 family member Bad, which leads to the survival of the cell. The p38 kinases also phosphorylate I-kB, an inhibitor of NF-kB, and this leads to the activation of NF-kB and the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and inflammation. The Rac / PAK pathway is another pathway that regulates cell survival. Rac is a small G-protein in the Rho family that activates the p38 kinases and regulates the cytoskeleton and cell motility. PAK also activates the Raf / MEK / ERK pathway.",
  "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates fast synaptic transmission in the CNS. The NMDA receptor is a macromolecular complex consisting of an obligatory NR1 subunit and NR2 subunits (A-D). The NR2 subunits determine the channel properties and the signal transduction pathways. The NR1 subunit is necessary for the assembly of the receptor and its transport to the cell surface. The NR2 subunits determine the subcellular localization and signal transduction pathways. The NR2 subunits are required for the synaptic localization of the receptor. The NR1 and NR2 subunits are subject to rapid and extensive posttranslational modification, including phosphorylation, palmitoylation, and S-nitrosylation. These modifications play a key role in the regulation of the receptor's activity. The NR1 subunit is phosphorylated by PKA, PKC, and CAMKII. The NR2 subunits are phosphorylated by PKC, CAMKII, and PKG. The phosphorylation of the NR1 and NR2 subunits increases the open probability of the receptor and the influx of calcium. The phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit also increases the affinity of the receptor for glycine. The phosphorylation of the NR1 and NR2 subunits also regulates the interaction of the receptor with other proteins. The interaction of the NR1 subunit with calmodulin and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) is regulated by the phosphorylation state of the NR1 subunit. The interaction of the NR2 subunits with PSD-9 5 and SAP9 7 is also regulated by the phosphorylation state of the NR2 subunits. The phosphorylation of the NR1 and NR2 subunits also regulates the interaction of the receptor with other signaling molecules. The interaction of the receptor with G-protein-coupled receptors and downstream signaling pathways is also regulated by the phosphorylation state of the NR1 and NR2 subunits.",
  "The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor is a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis. The NF-kB family consists of five structurally related proteins: NFKB1 (p5 0), NFKB2 (p5 2), REL (p6 5), RELA (p6 5), and RELB. In most cells, NF-kB is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive state by association with an inhibitor protein, IkB. Various stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines, antigen receptor engagement, and oxidants, can activate NF-kB. The activation of NF-kB involves the phosphorylation of IkB, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, and the subsequent translocation of the NF-kB complex to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of target genes. The IkB kinase (IKK) complex is required for the activation of NF-kB by these stimuli. The catalytic subunits of IKK, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, are required for the phosphorylation of IkB and the activation of NF-kB by most agents that activate NF-kB. The activation of NF-kB by TNF and IL-1 is mediated by the TRAF proteins, which act as adaptors between the receptors for these cytokines and the IKK complex. The activation of NF-kB by oxidants and UV radiation is mediated by NIK and MEKK1, two MAP kinase kinase kinases that activate the IKK complex. The activation of NF-kB by T cell activation involves the protein kinase Akt, which phosphorylates and activates the IKK complex. The genes activated by NF-kB include cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and other factors involved in inflammation and immune responses. The activation of NF-kB by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes also may play a role in these processes.",
  "Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a polypeptide hormone that stimulates growth and development of many tissues. IGF-1 binds to its receptor and activates a signaling pathway that resembles that of insulin. IGF-1 is produced by the liver and acts on tissues to stimulate growth. IGF-1 also acts as a neuroprotective agent. IGF-1 is an important growth factor and a neuroprotective agent. IGF-1 is also a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases. The IGF-1 receptor is a tyrosine kinase and activation of the receptor leads to the activation of several signaling pathways. One pathway leads to the activation of Ras and the activation of the Map kinase pathway. Another pathway leads to the activation of PI3 kinase and the activation of Akt. Both of these pathways lead to the activation of genes that stimulate growth and proliferation.",
  "The TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) members are a group of structurally related cell surface receptors that are involved in the regulation of immune responses. The ligands of the TNFRSF include TNF (also known as TNF-alpha) and the TNF-like proteins FasL (also known as FasL or TNFSF6) and TRAIL (also known as APO-2L or TNFSF1 0). The TNFRSF members are involved in the regulation of immune responses through their ability to induce apoptosis in cells that are inappropriately stimulated through the TNFRSF. The ligands of the TNFRSF are type-I transmembrane proteins and are not themselves able to induce apoptosis. The ligands of the TNFRSF are expressed as type-II transmembrane proteins and are cleaved by proteases in the extracellular domain to release a soluble factor that can bind to and activate their receptors on the cell surface of the same or adjacent cells. The ligands of the TNFRSF can also be shed as soluble factors and can act as soluble cytokines to regulate immune responses. The signaling pathways activated by the TNFRSF members are similar in many ways and include the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kB and the activation of protein kinases such as map kinases and the IkB kinase.",
  "The Cbl proto-oncogene encodes a protein of 200kD that is a member of a family of proteins that includes Cbl-b and Cbl-c. Cbl proteins are targets of tyrosine kinases and act as adaptors to bring other proteins into proximity with tyrosine kinases. Cbl proteins bind to a variety of tyrosine kinases including the EGF receptor, the PDGF receptor, the c-kit receptor, the T cell receptor, and the FLT3 receptor. Cbl also binds to the ZAP-7 0 tyrosine kinase and the Tec family kinase Btk. Cbl proteins bind to a variety of signaling molecules including the p8 5 subunit of PI3-kinase, Crk, the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2, and the tyrosine kinase ZAP-7 0. Cbl also binds to the ubiquitin ligase, HECT3C. Cbl ubiquitinates itself and other proteins and targets them for degradation in the proteosome. Cbl proteins also act as E3 ubiquitin ligases for the EGF receptor and may act as a negative regulator of EGF signaling. The v-Cbl oncogene encoded by the Cas NS-1 retrovirus is a truncated form of Cbl that lacks the amino terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain and the C3HC4 ring finger domain. The v-Cbl protein transforms cells by constitutively activating signaling pathways and not by blocking down regulation of signaling. The v-Cbl protein binds to the EGF receptor and activates signaling pathways downstream of the EGF receptor. The v-Cbl protein also binds to the tyrosine kinase Lck and activates the Lck kinase. The Cbl gene is mutated in some myeloid leukemias. The C3HC4 ring finger domain of Cbl is required for its negative regulatory activity. Point mutations in the C3HC4 domain found in myeloid leukemias inactivate the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl and cause constitutive activation of signaling pathways.",
  "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor gene family. PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Three subtypes of PPAR have been identified, alpha, delta, and gamma. PPAR gamma is expressed in adipose tissue and is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. PPAR alpha is expressed in high levels in liver and plays a key role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. PPAR gamma is expressed in adipose tissue and plays a role in adipocyte differentiation. PPAR gamma agonists are used to treat type II diabetes. The three PPAR subtypes have different expression patterns and distinct functions. PPAR gamma is activated by thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of drugs used to treat type II diabetes. PPAR gamma is also activated by prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), a by-product of lipid peroxidation. PPAR alpha is activated by fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPAR gamma is activated by fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPAR gamma is also activated by the antidiabetic drugs thiazolidinediones (TZDs). PPAR gamma is expressed in adipose tissue and plays a key role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. PPAR gamma is also expressed in macrophages and is involved in lipid metabolism in these cells. PPAR gamma is also expressed in intestinal cells where it is involved in lipid absorption. PPAR gamma is also expressed in colon epithelial cells where it may play a role in colon cancer.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically regulated form of cell death that is distinct from necrosis. It is characterized by condensation of chromatin, fragmentation of the nucleus, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspases are initially synthesized as inactive proenzymes that are proteolytically activated by cleavage. Caspases are grouped into two groups: the initiator caspases (caspase-8, -9, and -1 0) and the executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7). Caspases are activated through two main pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the engagement of cell surface receptors and is mediated by caspase-8. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by various stimuli that cause mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in the release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which activates caspase-9. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, -6, and -7. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates the mitochondrial pathway by controlling the release of cytochrome c. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent apoptosis, whereas Bax and Bid promote apoptosis. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are linked through caspase-8 activation of Bid, which translocates to mitochondria and induces cytochrome c release.",
  "Hereditary periodic fever syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation. The familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary periodic fever syndrome. The FMF is caused by a mutation of the MEFV gene, which encodes pyrin. Pyrin is an important regulator of the inflammatory response. The most common mutation of the MEFV gene is a cytosine to an alanine substitution at position 6 9 4 (M6 9 4V). Pyrin interacts with caspase-1 and inhibits the activation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). The mutated form of pyrin is unable to inhibit caspase-1and leads to excessive IL-1beta production and inflammation. The NALP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that includes NALP1, NALP3, and ASC. NALP1 and NALP3 are intracellular receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns and endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns. NALP3 is also involved in the activation of inflammatory caspases and the secretion of IL-1beta. The PSTPIP1 protein is involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton reorganization and apoptosis. Mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene lead to an increased tendency to form intracellular aggregates.",
  "The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and susceptibility to infection. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the WAS protein (WASP). WASP is a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton reorganization. WASP interacts with a variety of proteins, including the Arp2 / 3 complex, a key nucleator of actin polymerization. The Arp2 / 3 complex is localized in lamellipodia and filopodia, where actin is actively polymerized and reorganized. WASP is an auto-inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex. WASP is activated by interaction with the small GTPase Cdc4 2. The interaction of WASP with Cdc4 2 also induces the formation of filopodia. The interaction of WASP with the receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase p140 (CDCP1) activates the Arp2 / 3 complex and stimulates cell migration. The interaction of WASP with the adaptor protein CrkL activates the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and induces changes in cell morphology.",
  "The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha is involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis, septic shock, and other inflammatory conditions. TNF-alpha is produced by macrophages in response to infection and other inflammatory stimuli. TNF-alpha binds to two different receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which are differentially expressed on different cell types. Binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1 can lead to apoptosis, while binding to TNFR2 can lead to activation of NF-kB and other signaling pathways. The cytoplasmic domains of TNFR1 and TNFR2 contain a death domain that interacts with other death domain-containing proteins, including TRADD, FADD, and RIP. These interactions lead to activation of the NF-kB and JNK pathways, and apoptosis.",
  "The protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a recently identified family of G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage of a portion of the amino terminus of the receptor, unmasking a new amino terminus that functions as a ligand. Four distinct PARs have been identified in mammals, each of which is activated by a different protease. The PAR-1 receptor is activated by the serine protease thrombin, and PAR-2 is activated by trypsin and by the peptide SLIGRL. PAR-4 is activated by the peptide GYPGQV, and PAR-3 is activated by the peptide SFLLRN. PAR-1 and PAR-3 are cleaved by trypsin, but PAR-2 and PAR-4 are not. PAR-1 and PAR-2 are also activated by the coagulation protease factor Xa and by the kallikrein-kinin pathway. PAR-1 and PAR-2 are widely expressed in the body and are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including platelet activation, inflammation, and blood vessel formation. PAR-4 is found in the vascular endothelium and is involved in platelet activation. PAR-3 is found in the brain and is involved in neuronal signaling. The PAR-1 and PAR-2 receptors are cleaved and activated by the same proteases, but the signaling pathways activated by these receptors are distinct. Cleavage of PAR-1 by thrombin unmasks a tethered ligand that activates the receptor. PAR-1 activation by thrombin leads to a Gq-mediated increase in intracellular calcium, activation of protein kinase C, and activation of the MAP kinase pathway. PAR-1 also couples to Gi, but activation of this pathway does not appear to be involved in the activation of MAP kinase by thrombin. PAR-2 activation by trypsin or the synthetic peptide SLIGRL leads to a Gi-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase and a subsequent inhibition of cAMP production. PAR-2 also couples to Gq, but activation of this pathway does not appear to be involved in the activation of MAP kinase by trypsin or SLIGRL. PAR-2 activation also leads to activation of the MAP kinase pathway, but this pathway appears to be independent of Gi. The PAR-3 receptor is also coupled to Gi, but unlike PAR-2, activation of PAR-3 does not appear to lead to activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The PAR-3 receptor is also cleaved by trypsin, but the tethered ligand does not appear to activate the receptor. The PAR-3 receptor does appear to play a role in neuronal signaling, however, and appears to couple to a Go-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the primary regulator of the synthesis and release of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH, from the pituitary gland. The decapeptide GnRH is secreted by the hypothalamus and binds to receptors on the surface of the gonadotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The receptor activation leads to the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including the phospholipase C pathway, the protein kinase C pathway, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The activation of these signaling cascades ultimately leads to the expression of the gonadotropin genes and the release of the gonadotropins.",
  "The development of T cells is a complex process involving multiple factors. The thymus is the site where T cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells. Thymic stromal cells produce a variety of cytokines that regulate the differentiation of T cells. The cytokines include IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-2, IL-4, IL-37, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-11, IL-13, and TGF-beta. The interaction of these cytokines with their receptors on the surface of T cells regulates the proliferation and differentiation of T cells. The interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is also important for T cell differentiation. The interaction of T cell receptor (TCR) with MHC-peptide complex on the surface of APCs is required for positive selection of T cells in the thymus. The interaction of TCR with MHC-peptide complex on the surface of APCs is not required for negative selection of T cells in the thymus. The interaction of TCR with MHC-peptide complex on the surface of APCs induces the expression of IL-2 and IL-2Ra genes in T cells. IL-2 and IL-2Ra induce the proliferation of T cells. The interaction of TCR with MHC-peptide complex on the surface of APCs also induces the expression of Fas ligand (FasL) in T cells. The interaction of Fas-FasL induces apoptosis of T cells that do not interact with antigen.",
  "Calcineurin is a calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase that regulates many cellular processes including T cell activation. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). Activated NFAT translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of cytokine genes. The regulatory subunit of calcineurin, CnB, is expressed in many cell types, but the expression of the catalytic subunit, CnA, is limited to cells of the immune system. The expression of CnA is induced by the transcription factor NFAT, which is activated by calcineurin. The expression of CnA is also regulated by the transcription factor Mef2. Mef2 is activated by calcium signaling and activates the expression of the transcription factor Egr2, which binds to the calcineurin promoter and activates its expression. Egr2 also activates the expression of the transcription factor Mef2c, which activates the expression of CnA. Mef2c also activates the expression of the transcription factor NFAT, which activates the expression of Egr2 and Mef2c. Mef2c is also required for the expression of the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, CnB. The activation of calcineurin is also regulated by the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. PKC phosphorylates the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, which inhibits its activity. The inhibition of calcineurin by PKC may play a role in the regulation of T cell activation by the antigen receptor.",
  "The interferon (IFN) family of cytokines plays an important role in the innate immune response to viral infection. The IFN family includes several subtypes of alpha, beta, and gamma, as well as several members of the IL-1 0 family. The IL-1 0 family includes IL-1 0, IL-2 0, IL-2 2, and IL-2 4. The IFN family is a subset of cytokines that includes IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-omega. The IL-1 0 family includes IL-1 0, IL-2 0, IL-2 2, and IL-2 4. The IL-1 0 family members are involved in the regulation of the immune response, inflammation, and cell proliferation. The IFN family members signal through a receptor complex that includes an IFN-alpha / beta receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) and an IFN-gamma receptor subunit 1 (IFNGR1). The IL-1 0 family members signal through a receptor complex that includes an IL-1 0 receptor subunit 2 (IL-1 0R2) and an IL-2 0R1 receptor subunit. The IL-1 0 family members activate a different set of genes than the IFN family members. The IL-1 0 family members activate STAT transcription factors, while the IFN family members activate STAT1 and STAT3. The IL-1 0 family members also activate the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, while the IFN family members do not. The IL-1 0 family members activate the JAK / STAT pathway through the IL-1 0R2 receptor subunit. The IL-1 0 family members activate the JAK / STAT pathway through the IL-1 0R2 receptor subunit. The IL-1 0 family members also activate the JNK pathway through the IL-1 0R2 receptor subunit. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by many cytokines, including IL-6, IL-2 3, and IL-2 1. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by many cytokines through the IL-6R2 receptor subunit. The IL-1 0 family members activate the JAK / STAT pathway through the IL-1 0R2 receptor subunit. The IL-1 0R2 receptor subunit is also used by IL-2 2 and IL-2 4. The IL-1 0 family members activate the JNK pathway through the IL-1 0R2 receptor subunit. The JNK pathway is activated by many cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-4. The JNK pathway is activated by many cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-4.",
  "Inflammation is a protective response to harmful stimuli such as infection and injury. However, chronic inflammation can lead to tissue damage and disease. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a by-product of metabolism that can damage cells if they are not removed or controlled. ROS include free radicals such as superoxide (O2 -) and hydroxyl radicals (OH), as well as non-radical molecules such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cells have several mechanisms to control ROS levels, including the use of antioxidants to neutralize ROS, and the use of enzymes to repair damage caused by ROS. Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide that plays a key role in the neutralization of ROS. Glutathione is synthesized from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutamate is synthesized from glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), a rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Glutamate-cysteine ligase is regulated by the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the actin-binding protein Keap1. ROS and electrophiles activate Nrf2 by modification of cysteine residues in Keap1, causing the release and translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. Nrf2 activates the transcription of genes containing an antioxidant response element (ARE), including GCL and glutathione synthetase. Glutathione is used to reduce ROS, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) reduces H2O2 to H2O and O2. Glutathione reductase (GSR) reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG) back to GSH. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts superoxide to H2O2, which is then reduced to H2O by GPX and GSR. Catalase (CAT) breaks down H2O2 to H2O and O2. Glutathione is also used to repair oxidative damage caused by ROS. Glutathione peroxidase reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to glutathione (GSH). Glutathione is transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria and the nucleus. The transport of glutathione into the mitochondria is regulated by the mitochondrial glutathione transporter (OGC). The transport of glutathione into the nucleus is regulated by the nuclear glutathione transporter (NGT). Oxidative stress causes the oxidation of cysteine in OGC, releasing glutathione into the cytoplasm. Reduced glutathione in the cytoplasm is transported into the nucleus by NGT. The transport of glutathione into the mitochondria is regulated by the mitochondrial glutathione transporter (MIT). Glutathione in the nucleus is used to repair oxidative damage, and glutathione in the mitochondria is used to maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial genome. Oxidative stress also activates NF-kB, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and cell survival. NF-kB is sequestered in the cytosol by binding to the inhibitor IkB. ROS activates the kinase IKK, which phosphorylates IkB, causing the release and translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus. NF-kB activates the transcription of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and cell survival.",
  "The electron transport chain in mitochondria is composed of four major protein complexes, the I-IV complexes. The complexes are embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane and transfer electrons from NADH (complex I), FADH2 (complex II), ubiquinol (complex III), and ubiquinone (complex III) to molecular oxygen. The transfer of electrons through the complexes creates a proton gradient across the membrane that is used by the ATP synthase to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The transfer of electrons through the electron transport chain is a multistep process. The first step is the oxidation of a substrate by transferring an electron to a carrier protein. The next step is the transfer of the electron to a protein in the chain, usually a cytochrome. The transfer of electrons from cytochrome to oxygen is coupled to the translocation of four protons from the inside to the outside of the membrane. The transfer of electrons from cytochrome to oxygen is coupled to the translocation of four protons from the inside to the outside of the membrane. The flow of electrons through the chain is coupled to the proton gradient, and the synthesis of ATP. The transfer of electrons through the chain is a series of one-electron transfer reactions. The first electron transfer reaction in the chain is from NADH to ubiquinone. The next two reactions transfer electrons from ubiquinone to cytochrome c. The transfer of the fourth electron to oxygen is coupled to the translocation of protons across the membrane. The transfer of electrons through the chain is coupled to the translocation of four protons from the inside to the outside of the membrane. The transfer of electrons through the chain is a series of one-electron transfer reactions. The first electron transfer reaction in the chain is from NADH to ubiquinone. The next two reactions transfer electrons from ubiquinone to cytochrome c. The transfer of the fourth electron from ubiquinone to oxygen is coupled to the translocation of four protons from the inside to the outside of the membrane. The transfer of electrons through the chain is a series of one-electron transfer reactions. The transfer of the first electron through the chain is the transfer of a hydride ion from NADH to ubiquinone. The next two reactions transfer electrons from ubiquinone to cytochrome c. The transfer of the fourth electron from ubiquinone to oxygen is coupled to the translocation of four protons across the membrane.",
  "Axon guidance is a crucial step in the formation of neuronal networks. Axons are guided by a variety of guidance cues, such as netrins, ephrins, Slits, and Slits-family secreted proteins. These guidance cues are detected by growth cone receptors, and the signal is transduced intracellularly by small GTPases of the Rho family. Activation of the Rho GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc4 2, and RhoA, leads to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for growth cone motility.",
  "Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that regulate differentiation and proliferation of epithelial tissues. The active metabolite of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), induces growth arrest and differentiation of epithelial cells. The ability of atRA to induce growth arrest and differentiation is exploited in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The differentiation therapy approach has also been successful in the treatment of other cancers. The molecular basis of the ability of atRA to induce growth arrest and differentiation is not well understood. The molecular basis of the therapeutic activity of retinoids in APL is due to the ability of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) to recruit co-repressors and repress transcription of target genes. The ability of retinoids to induce growth arrest and differentiation is also due to the ability of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to recruit co-activators and activate transcription. The ability of RXR ligands to induce differentiation is enhanced by the presence of RAR ligands. The ability of retinoids to induce growth arrest and differentiation is also due to the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p15, which leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression. The ability of retinoids to induce apoptosis is due to the induction of the tumor suppressor gene, p15.",
  "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammalian cells. NHEJ is error-prone and can lead to the loss of genetic information at the site of the DSB. NHEJ is initiated by the binding of the KU heterodimer to the ends of the DSB. KU then recruits DNA-PKcs, which in turn activates the nuclease activity of the MRN complex and the processing of the ends by the nucleases X45L and Artemis. DNA ligase IV (LIG4) and XRCC4 form a complex that joins the DNA ends. NHEJ is also active in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, when homologous recombination is not available to repair the DSB. Factors that stimulate NHEJ include the histone acetylase Tip6 0, the DNA end-binding protein Ku8 0, and the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. NHEJ is inhibited by the binding of the Ku heterodimer to DNA ends in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, preventing the recruitment of DNA-PKcs. NHEJ is also inhibited by the binding of the tumor suppressor protein 5 3BP1 to the DSB.",
  "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal system that regulates blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Angiotensinogen is converted to the decapeptide angiotensin I by renin. Angiotensin I is then cleaved by ACE to the heptapeptide angiotensin II, which acts on the angiotensin II type 1 receptor to exert its physiological effects. Angiotensinogen is found in the plasma and is synthesized in the liver. Angiotensinogen is also found in the heart, and is synthesized in the heart by cardiac myocytes. Cardiac myocytes also synthesize ACE, which is found in the plasma and in the heart. Angiotensinogen is found in the cardiac interstitium, and is converted to angiotensin I by cardiac mast cells. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor is found in cardiac myocytes, and is found in cardiac fibroblasts as well. Binding of angiotensin II to its receptor on cardiac fibroblasts causes them to proliferate and differentiate into cardiac fibroblasts that produce collagen. Cardiac fibroblasts also produce ACE, which increases the amount of angiotensin II that is formed. The increase in collagen in the heart causes hypertrophy of the heart, which can lead to heart failure. Angiotensinogen is also found in the heart, but is not converted to angiotensin I by cardiac mast cells. Angiotensinogen is also found in the plasma, and is converted to angiotensin I by renin in the blood. The increase in blood pressure caused by angiotensin II is opposed by the peptide bradykinin, which is produced from the decapeptide angiotensin I by ACE. Bradykinin causes vasodilation and inhibits the release of catecholamines. ACE also inactivates the vasodilator bradykinin. ACE inhibitors block the degradation of bradykinin, causing prolonged vasodilation and increased blood flow to the kidneys and other organs. ACE inhibitors also increase the amount of bradykinin in the heart, which may help to prevent heart disease.",
  "The Hedgehog (HH) family of secreted proteins plays a key role in development. Aberrant activation of HH signaling has been implicated in a variety of human cancers. In vertebrates, HH signaling is mediated by the Patched (Ptc) receptor. Ptc inhibits the activity of Smoothened (Smo), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Binding of HH to Ptc relieves Ptc inhibition of Smo, activating the pathway. In the absence of HH, Smo is found in an inactive state in a complex with Suppressor of Fused (Sufu). Binding of HH to Ptc causes the dissociation of Sufu from Smo, activating the Hh pathway. Activated Smo then inhibits the proteasome-mediated degradation of the Gli2 and Gli3 transcription factors. Gli2 and Gli3 are phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) and casein kinase 1 (CK1). Gli2 and Gli3 are also modified by the addition of multiple ubiquitin molecules, targeting them for proteosomal degradation. Hedgehog signaling is attenuated by the HHIP1 protein, a protein with similarity to Ptc that acts as a repressor of the pathway. The Gli1 protein acts as a transcriptional activator downstream of Smo, and its expression is induced by Hh signaling.",
  "Cell motility is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms and is essential for development, immune function, and wound healing. Cell motility is also important in the spread of disease-causing bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella. Cell motility is driven by the polymerization of actin filaments at the cell membrane. The Arp2 / 3 complex is a key regulator of actin polymerization and cell motility. The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by the WASP family of proteins, which include WASP, N-WASP, and WAVE. The activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex and cell motility are regulated by the Rho family of GTPases. WASP and N-WASP are regulated by the Rho family GTPase Cdc4 2.

The Arp2 / 3 complex is localized to the leading edge of moving cells by binding to the WASP proteins. The WASP proteins are regulated by the Rho family of GTPases. The WASP proteins are activated by Cdc4 2 and are inhibited by Rac. The WASP proteins activate the Arp2 / 3 complex by bringing the Arp2 and Arp3 proteins together. The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by the binding of ATP and nucleation of new actin monomers. The actin filaments are held together by the ARP2 / 3 complex. The movement of the actin filaments causes the cell membrane to protrude and the cell to move forward.",
  "The meiotic cell cycle is a special case of the cell cycle, in which two rounds of chromosome segregation follow a single round of DNA replication (S phase) without an intervening S phase. In mammals, oocytes are arrested at the prophase of meiosis I (prophase I), at which time the meiotic cell cycle is committed to a single round of DNA replication (S phase) followed by a single round of chromosome segregation (meiosis I). The resumption of meiosis is induced by the hormone luteinizing hormone (LH), which activates the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. The cAMP signal is essential for the resumption of meiosis and is inhibited by the MPF (maturation-promoting factor), a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -cyclin complex. The cAMP signal is also required for the completion of meiosis I and the first meiotic division. The cAMP signal is also required for the arrest of the second meiotic division and the arrest of the first mitotic cell cycle. The cAMP signal is generated by the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) and inhibited by the cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE). The activity of AC is regulated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and by the soluble AC (sAC). The activity of PDE is regulated by the binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit of PDE.",
  "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a cytokine that regulates a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGF-beta signals through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II serine / threonine kinase receptors. The type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates the receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3. The activated R-Smads form a complex with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, and are then translocated into the nucleus to regulate transcription. Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), Smad6 and Smad7, antagonize the TGF-beta signaling pathway by binding to the type I receptor and recruiting the Smurf E3 ubiquitin ligase to the receptor complex, targeting the R-Smads for degradation. Ski and SnoN are transcriptional corepressors that bind to and inhibit the activity of the TGF-beta Smads. The Ski and SnoN genes are transcriptional targets of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Ski and SnoN are also transcriptional corepressors that are recruited to TGF-beta-regulated promoters by the Smads. TGF-beta induces the degradation of SnoN, releasing SnoN to repress transcription.",
  "The immune system is a network of cells and molecules that defends the body against invading pathogens and that also helps to maintain tolerance to self-antigens. T cells are the key players in the immune system, and their activation requires two signals: the first is provided by the T cell receptor (TCR) when it binds to antigen presented by MHC-I on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The second signal is provided by costimulatory molecules that bind to receptors on the T cell surface. When both signals are present, the T cell is activated and can mount an immune response. When only the first signal is present, the T cell is not activated. The absence of the second signal can lead to T cell anergy or T cell deletion.",
  "The complement system is a group of plasma proteins that are part of the humoral immune response. The complement system is activated by three different pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway. The classical pathway is initiated by the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes on the cell surface by the C1 complex. The C1 complex is composed of a tetramer of two C1q proteins and two proteases, C1r and C1s. The lectin pathway is triggered by the recognition of carbohydrate structures on the bacterial cell wall by the mannan-binding lectin (MBL) or the ficolins. The lectin pathway is similar to the classical pathway in that it is initiated by the recognition of carbohydrate structures on the bacterial cell wall by MBL or the ficolins. The alternative pathway is initiated by spontaneous C3 activation. The C3 convertase cleaves C3 to C3a and C3b. The opsonin C3b binds covalently to foreign cells and is involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The formation of MAC causes lysis of bacterial cells and cell debris.",
  "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite that regulates many cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. S1P is produced by phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase (SPHK). Two isoforms of SPHK have been identified, SPHK1 and SPHK2. SPHK1 is a cytosolic enzyme, whereas SPHK2 is associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. SPHK1 is activated by the small G proteins Ras and Rac, and inhibited by the tumor suppressor protein p15INK4b. SPHK1 activation results in the production of S1P, which is exported out of the cell by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCC1. S1P is degraded by S1P phosphatases (SPP) to sphingosine and inorganic phosphate. S1P binds to a family of five G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), Edg-1 / S1P1, Edg-2 / S1P2, Edg-3 / S1P3, Edg-4 / S1P4, and Edg-5 / S1P5. S1P stimulates cell proliferation and survival through the Edg-1 and Edg-2 receptors. The Edg-3 receptor couples to Gi, Gq, and G1 2 / 1 3, and mediates both inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and stimulation of phospholipase C, leading to mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of the MAP kinase pathway. S1P also activates Rac and induces actin reorganization through the Edg-4 receptor. The Edg-5 receptor couples to Gi and Gq, and is coupled to the PI3 kinase and Rho pathways. S1P also induces endothelial cell migration and vascular maturation through the Edg-1 and Edg-5 receptors. The Edg-3 receptor is coupled to Gi, but its role in S1P-induced endothelial cell migration is not clear. S1P also induces angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the Edg-1 and Edg-5 receptors. The S1P / Edg-1 pathway also plays an important role in lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs.",
  "The Fas / FasL signaling pathway is one of the main pathways that induces apoptosis in cells. Fas is a member of the TNF receptor gene family and is activated by its ligand, FasL. Fas is expressed in many tissues and is involved in the immune response, the regulation of apoptosis, and the development of the nervous system. Binding of FasL to Fas induces receptor aggregation and recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) adaptor protein to the cytoplasmic domain of Fas. FADD in turn recruits the caspase-8 zymogen to the receptor complex. Caspase-8 activation then leads to the cleavage and activation of downstream caspases and the execution of apoptosis. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are molecular chaperones that assist in the folding of other proteins and help cells to survive stress conditions. Hsps are also involved in the regulation of apoptosis. One of the functions of Hsps is to bind to the activated Fas receptor and block the recruitment of FADD and the initiation of apoptosis. Another function of Hsps is to block apoptosis by blocking the activation of caspase-3.",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a key role in development of many tissues and organs. Binding of Hh to Patched (Ptc) relieves Ptc-mediated inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), allowing activation of the glioma-associated oncogene (Gli) family of transcription factors. In vertebrates, there are three Gli proteins, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3, which can act as activators or repressors of transcription. In the absence of Hh, Gli2 and Gli3 are processed into repressors that inhibit transcription of Hh target genes. Binding of Hh to Ptc relieves this inhibition, allowing Gli2 and Gli3 to activate transcription of Hh target genes. Hh signaling is involved in the development of many tissues and organs, including the brain, spinal cord, muscle, skin, lung, stomach, and teeth. Defects in Hh signaling are associated with birth defects and cancer.",
  "Fc epsilon RI-mediated mast cell activation is a multi-step process. The first step is the recognition of antigen by the Fc epsilon RI. This is followed by the activation of a number of signaling pathways, including the release of calcium from intracellular stores and influx of calcium from the extracellular space. The release of calcium activates a variety of signaling pathways including the activation of PKC and the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway leads to the activation of transcription factors such as ELK-1 and NF-AT. The activation of these transcription factors leads to the production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.",
  "The high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) is expressed on mast cells and basophils and plays a central role in allergic reactions. Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI by allergens triggers the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins and leukotrienes from mast cells and basophils. These mediators in turn cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretion and smooth muscle contraction, which result in the symptoms of allergic reactions. Fc epsilon RI is a tetrameric protein complex consisting of an alpha chain, a beta chain and two gamma chains. The alpha chain contains the ligand-binding domain and is responsible for the binding of IgE. The beta chain is involved in the signal transduction pathway and the gamma chain is required for the cell surface expression of Fc epsilon RI. Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI by allergens induces the activation of multiple signaling pathways including tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, protein kinase C activation, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The activation of these signaling pathways leads to the release of inflammatory mediators.",
  "The Cbl protein is a substrate of the tyrosine kinase receptors and is involved in down-regulation of the activated receptors. The down-regulation is accomplished by Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the activated receptors in lysosomes. The Cbl protein has three functional domains: an N-terminal TKB domain, a RING finger domain and a C-terminal b-casette. The TKB domain binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of the activated receptors and the RING finger domain is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated receptors. The b-casette domain is involved in the interaction with the E2 ubiquitin conjugase UbcH7 and the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl. The interaction of Cbl with the activated growth factor receptors is mediated by the GRB2 protein. The GRB2-Cbl interaction is mediated by the SH3 domains of GRB2 and the a-helical domain of Cbl. The GRB2 protein is a component of the mitogenic signaling pathway and is involved in the activation of the RAS-MAP kinase pathway downstream of the growth factor receptors. The interaction of Cbl with GRB2 is negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl is induced by the activated growth factor receptors and is mediated by the SRC family kinases. The negative regulation of the GRB2-Cbl interaction by tyrosine phosphorylation is part of the feedback inhibition mechanism of the mitogenic signaling pathway.",
  "N-glycans are a class of glycans that are covalently attached to asparagine residues in proteins through an N-glycosidic bond. N-glycans are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. The N-glycan precursor is assembled on the lipid carrier dolichol, and then transferred to the polypeptide chain by the OST complex in the ER membrane. The N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed and modified in the ER and Golgi apparatus. N-glycans play important roles in protein folding, quality control, and quality control of glycoproteins.",
  "Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid mediator that is synthesized by a variety of cell types in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli. PAF is a potent lipid mediator that induces a variety of biological responses in many different cell types through a specific G-protein coupled receptor. The biological actions of PAF are mediated through the PAF receptor, a 7-transmembrane receptor that signals through a Gq-protein coupled pathway to activate phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to generate inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate mobilizes intracellular calcium, which activates protein kinase C, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. PAF also activates the MAPK pathway through a G-protein coupled pathway.",
  "The alpha subunit of Gq is a G-protein coupled receptor that stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) when activated by the peptide ligand endothelin. The PLC enzyme cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce two second messengers: inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 mobilizes intracellular calcium, and DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). DAG and calcium are also important in activating the small G protein Rho. Rho activates the kinase ROCKI, which phosphorylates myosin light chain and other targets to increase acto-myosin contraction. The pathway from Gq to Rho is not yet clear, but may involve the protein kinase PKN.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone that regulates growth and metabolism. The actions of GH are mediated by the GH receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The GHR is widely expressed in many tissues, including the liver, where it mediates the metabolic actions of GH. Binding of GH to the GHR activates the JAK2 tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates and activates STAT5. STAT5 activates transcription of genes containing STAT5 response elements. In addition to STAT5, other signaling pathways are activated by GH, including the Ras-MAPK pathway. Ras activates Raf1, which activates MEK, which phosphorylates and activates ERK1 and ERK2. The Ras-MAPK pathway is also activated by many growth factors, including IGF-1. The Ras-MAPK pathway is also activated by other cytokines, including IL-6 and LIF. Cytokines activate the Ras-MAPK pathway through the IRS proteins, which recruit and activate the tyrosine kinase, JAK. The Ras-MAPK pathway also plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The role of Ras in cell proliferation is complex, with both positive and negative roles. Ras activates the Map kinases, MEK1 and MEK2, which activate ERK1 and ERK2. The Map kinases phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as ELK-1, which activates transcription of genes containing ELK-1 response elements. The Ras-MAPK pathway also activates the transcription factor STAT3, which can also activate genes containing STAT3 response elements. The Ras-MAPK pathway also activates the transcription factor AP-1, which can activate genes containing AP-1 response elements. The role of Ras in cell proliferation is also complex, with both positive and negative roles. The role of Ras in cell differentiation is less clear.

  "Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and generates one molecule of each of ATP, NADH and DHAP. The pathway is simple, but the pathway is very complex, with many different enzymes and many different steps. The pathway starts with the uptake of glucose into cells by glucose transporters, and ends with the release of pyruvate and the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle. The pathway is also important for the generation of ATP, NADH and other important molecules. The pathway is not a simple pathway, but there are many different steps that can be regulated to alter the flow of metabolites through the pathway. The first three steps of the pathway are irreversible and there are many different enzymes that can be regulated to alter the flow of metabolites through the pathway. The first step is the uptake of glucose into the cell, catalyzed by the glucose transporter. The next two steps are catalyzed by hexokinase, which phosphorylates glucose to form glucose-6-phosphate. There are four different hexokinase genes in mammals, but the different hexokinase enzymes are differentially regulated by different signals. The third step of the pathway is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate to form 6-phosphogluconolactone. The last step of the pathway is the conversion of 6-phosphogluconolactone to pyruvate by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. There are two different genes for phosphoglucomutase, but the two enzymes are very similar proteins. The final step of the pathway is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase.

  "Apoptosis is a genetically programmed cell death that is involved in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that are essential for the execution of apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens and are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases are classified into two groups based on their structure and function. The initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -1 0) are activated by specific upstream proteases (caspase-8, -9, and -1 0), which are known as the apical caspases. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are involved in the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, respectively. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, ER stress, and growth factor withdrawal, and results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which activates caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 cleaves and activates downstream caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and-7. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by the binding of death receptors to their ligands, such as Fas / APO-1, TNF-alpha, and TRAIL. Binding of these ligands to their receptors recruits the adaptor protein FADD and the initiator caspase-8 to the receptor. The resulting formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) leads to the activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates caspase-3, -6, and-7. Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis through control of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, whereas Bax and Bak promote it. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are localized in the mitochondrial membrane, whereas Bax and Bak are localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Caspases are activated by proteolytic cleavage, and the active caspases in turn cleave cellular substrates, leading to the morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis. IAP family proteins inhibit apoptosis by binding to active caspases. IAP proteins bind to active caspases through their baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain. IAP proteins also contain a RING domain that confers ubiquitin ligase activity. IAP proteins are often expressed at low levels in cells, and are regulated at the levels of transcription and protein stability.",
  "Insulin resistance is a key feature of type II diabetes. It is characterized by a reduced response to insulin of target tissues such as muscle, liver and adipose tissue. The molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance are not well understood. However, it is believed that insulin resistance is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors include mutations in the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, and the IRS-1 associated protein. Environmental factors include increased levels of free fatty acids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and oxidative stress. These factors induce serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 also leads to the degradation of IRS-1 and a reduction in IRS-1 expression. The reduced expression of IRS-1 causes insulin resistance.",
  "Ran is a Ras-like GTPase that regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport. In interphase cells, Ran is predominantly GDP-bound in the nucleus and GTP-bound in the cytoplasm.

The p53 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The p53 protein is activated by phosphorylation on serine-2 0 and serine-4 6 by the kinases ATM, ATR, and chk1 / 2. The p53 protein is found in a complex with the transcription factor NFkB in the nucleus of cells. The p53 protein binds to the NFkB inhibitor, IkB, and causes it to be phosphorylated by the IKB kinase, releasing NFkB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The p53-NFkB interaction is disrupted by the heat shock protein Hsp90. The interaction of p53 with NFkB may be involved in the anti-apoptotic function of p53.",
  "The Na + / K + -ATPase is a transmembrane ion pump that uses the energy of ATP to transport Na + and K + across the cell membrane. It is expressed in many tissues, including the kidneys, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and lungs.

  "Integrins are a family of cell surface adhesion receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Integrins are heterodimers formed from an association of noncovalently associated alpha and beta subunits. The extracellular domain of the integrin binds the extracellular matrix, and the cytoplasmic domain interacts with the cytoskeleton and signaling molecules to mediate cell adhesion and signaling. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally, with signals from the extracellular matrix (outside-in signaling) and signals from the cytoskeleton (inside-out signaling). The interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix regulates cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival. Disruption of integrin-mediated cell adhesion can lead to apoptosis, a process termed anoikis.

  "Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the interiors of adjacent cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two hemichannels, each containing six connexins. Each hemichannel is formed by the insertion of six connexins and is inserted into the plasma membrane of an adjacent cell. The docking of the two hemichannels from the adjacent cells creates an intercellular channel that allows direct transfer of small molecules (up to 1kDa) between cells. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is essential for a variety of physiological processes, including embryonic development, electrical coupling, metabolic transport, and the response to signaling molecules such as IP3 and cAMP. Gap junction channels are formed by at least three different gene families, alpha, beta, and gamma. The alpha-connexin family (Cx4 3, Cx2 6, Cx3 2, and Cx5 0) is restricted to tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the heart and skeletal muscle. The beta-connexin family (Cx3 1, Cx3 0, Cx2 5, and Cx3 6) is more widely expressed and is involved in epidermal and retinal tissues. The gamma-connexins (Cx4 5, Cx4 0, and Cx37) are restricted to the lens and are involved in the control of fiber cell differentiation. In addition to connexins, there are a number of other proteins that are localized to the gap junction structure and are involved in the formation and regulation of gap junctions. These include the cytoskeletal proteins, microtubules and actin microfilaments, the scaffolding proteins, ZO-1 and cingulin, and the protein kinases, p160-src and p38-MAPK. Disruption of gap junctional communication has been implicated in a number of human diseases, including certain types of cancer, and heart disease.",

The two adipokines that have been most extensively studied are leptin and adiponectin. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that acts on the hypothalamus to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin exerts its anorectic effects through the leptin receptor (LEPR), which is expressed in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus. Leptin binding to LEPR activates the JAK / STAT pathway and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which inhibits the signaling of the orexigenic agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). SOCS3 also inhibits the activation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) / phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) / Akt pathway. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that stimulates fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. The adiponectin receptor (AdipoR1 / T) is a member of the TNF receptor gene family. AdipoR1 / T activates the 5 '-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle, which leads to an increase in glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, adiponectin activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in skeletal muscle. Chronic inflammation is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. TNFalpha, IL-6 and other cytokines are secreted by adipose tissue and inflammatory cells. These cytokines activate IkappaB kinase (IKK) and NF-kappaB, which leads to the expression of inflammatory genes, including TNFalpha, IL-6 and others.",
  "The G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of cell surface receptors that respond to a variety of extracellular signals. The GPCRs are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The alpha subunit of the G protein is the main component that transduces the signal from the GPCR to the downstream effector. The alpha subunit can be classified into four groups based on its sequence and function: the Gs-alpha group (Gs-alpha, Golf-alpha, and Gs-alpha) stimulates adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP, the Gi-alpha group (Gi-alpha 1-4) inhibits adenylyl cyclase, the Gq / 1 1-alpha group (Gq-alpha, G1 1-alpha, G1 4-alpha, and G1 5-alpha) stimulates phospholipase C to produce IP3 and DAG, the G1 2 / 1 3-alpha group (G1 2-alpha and G1 3-alpha) stimulates RhoGEF to activate Rho, and the R-ras-alpha group (R-ras-alpha, TC2 1-alpha, and Rin-alpha) is involved in cell transformation. The G-alpha subunit is inactive when bound to GDP and active when bound to GTP. The signal is turned off when the bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP and Pi. The alpha subunit of the G protein can also interact with other signaling molecules to transduce signals independently of the G protein. For example, the beta gamma subunits of G proteins can activate PI 3-kinase independently of the alpha subunit. The alpha subunit of the G protein also interacts with RGS proteins to regulate the activity of GPCRs. The interaction of the alpha subunit with RGS proteins is regulated by the Gbeta subunit. The RGS proteins are GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the GTPase activity of the alpha subunit of the G protein, thus inactivating the G protein and turning off the signal. The interaction of the alpha subunit with RGS proteins is also regulated by the Gbeta subunit. The Gbeta subunit is a common subunit shared by all G proteins. The Gbeta subunit is required for the RGS activity of the RGS proteins. The Gbeta subunit also interacts with the kinase regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. The Gbeta subunit interacts with the RGS domain of the RGS proteins to increase the affinity of the RGS proteins for the alpha subunit of the G protein and to stimulate the GAP activity of the RGS proteins. The interaction of the Gbeta subunit with RGS proteins is regulated by the Ggamma subunit. The Ggamma subunit is a common subunit shared by the G proteins Gs, Gi, and Gt. The Ggamma subunit is also involved in the RGS activity of the RGS proteins. The Ggamma subunit interacts with the RGS domain of the RGS proteins to inhibit the RGS activity of the RGS proteins. The Ggamma subunit also interacts with the N-terminal domain of the Gbeta subunit to form a dimer that is required for the interaction of the Gbeta subunit with the RGS proteins. The interaction of the Ggamma subunit with the RGS domain of the RGS proteins is required for the inhibition of the RGS activity of the RGS proteins by the Ggamma subunit. The interaction of the Gbeta subunit with the RGS domain of the RGS proteins is also required for the interaction of the Gbeta subunit with the N-terminal domain of the Gbeta subunit. The Gbeta subunit also interacts with the N-terminal domain of the G protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2P4 4). The interaction of the Gbeta subunit with GRK2P4 4 is required for the phosphorylation of GRK2P4 4 by GRK2P4 4. The phosphorylation of GRK2P4 4 is required for the binding of GRK2P4 4 to the beta-arrestin proteins and the subsequent desensitization of the GPCR.",
  "The Ran GTPase cycle regulates the interaction of proteins with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope (NE) creates a spatial signal that regulates the interaction of proteins with the NPC. One of the proteins that interacts with RanGDP is importin-beta. Proteins that bind to importin-beta in the nucleus are not imported into the nucleus. When the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis, importin-beta is free to interact with other proteins in the cytoplasm. One of the proteins that binds to importin-beta is TPX2, a protein that activates the mitotic kinase Aurora A. TPX2 is imported into the nucleus by importin-beta and is released from importin-beta in the nucleus by the RanGTP gradient across the NE. TPX2 activates Aurora A in the cytoplasm and stimulates microtubule polymerization in the vicinity of the chromosomes. The RanGTP gradient also regulates the interaction of other proteins with the NPC. The import factor transportin interacts with RanGTP in the nucleus and is released from the NPC in the cytoplasm. One of the proteins that interacts with transportin is hnRNPA2. Transportin interacts with the mRNA in the nucleus and is released from the mRNA in the cytoplasm. RanGTP also regulates the interaction of other proteins with the NPC. The interaction of the Rev protein of HIV with the NPC is regulated by the Ran cycle. Rev binds to RanGTP in the nucleus and is released from RanGTP in the cytoplasm. The interaction of the HIV-1 protein Tat with the NPC is also regulated by the Ran cycle.",
  "Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are a key part of the immune system, killing virus-infected cells and tumor cells. CTLs are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells, presenting antigen on the surface. The interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and antigen-bound MHC-I activates the CTL. The CTL then secretes the toxic protein perforin (PFP) and the serine protease granzyme (Gzm) into the target cell. PFP oligomerizes in the membrane of the target cell, forming pores that allow the flow of ions and water, ultimately causing osmotic lysis of the cell. Gzm enters the target cell and cleaves several different proteins, including the caspase family of proteases. One of the targets of Gzm is the caspase-activated DNase (CAD), which is activated by cleavage and induces DNA degradation and apoptosis. PFP and Gzms also activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by cleaving Bid, a Bcl-2 family protein, and releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c activates Apaf-1, a protease that activates caspase-9. The caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that induce apoptosis when activated. The caspases cleave many different cellular proteins, ultimately causing cell death. CTLs also induce apoptosis in other cells through Fas ligand (FasL) binding to Fas on the target cell. The interaction of Fas and FasL activates caspase-8, which cleaves and activates caspase-3 and other caspases, causing apoptosis.",
  "Phagocytosis is the ingestion of large numbers of foreign material by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. It is a key component of the innate immune response and is important in the clearance of bacteria, fungi, parasites and other particulate matter. The Fc portion of IgG antibodies is the most important receptor system involved in phagocytosis. IgG-coated particles are recognized by Fc gamma receptors on the surface of macrophages and monocytes. Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors activates a variety of signaling pathways, including the tyrosine kinase-based pathway and the MAP kinase pathway. These pathways lead to actin cytoskeletal reorganization and membrane ruffling, which are required for the formation of phagocytic cups and phagosomes. The phagosomal membrane is then internalized by membrane fusion with lysosomes, a process that requires the action of the small GTPase Rab5. The phagosomal membrane is also modified by the acquisition of lysosomal membrane proteins and by the subsequent fusion with lysosomes. The phagosomal lumen is then acidified by the action of the proton pump ATPase, which is activated by the fusion of phagosomes with late endosomes. The low pH is required for the activation of the protease cathepsin D and for the inactivation of the anti-microbial peptide lysozyme. The degradation products are released to the cytoplasm for presentation to T cells.",
  "The methionine cycle is an essential amino acid biosynthetic pathway found in bacteria, plants, and animals. It produces methionine, the amino acid precursor of the essential amino acids isoleucine, valine, and leucine. In bacteria and plants, methionine is also a component of S-adenosylmethionine, an important methyl group donor in many biological processes. The methionine cycle begins with the conversion of aspartate to homocysteine. The next step is the transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate. The next step is the conversion of methionine to SAM, the methyl group donor in many biological processes. The enzymes of the methionine cycle are found in bacteria, plants, and animals.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled process of cell death that is characterized by a number of morphological and biochemical changes. One of the hallmarks of apoptosis is the cleavage of genomic DNA into nucleosomal fragments. The cleavage of DNA into nucleosomal fragments is mediated by the endonuclease G (Endo G). The activation of Endo G is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit the activation of Endo G, while Bax and Bad promote the activation of Endo G. The activation of Endo G is also regulated by the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP). The cleavage of DNA by Endo G is inhibited by the inhibitor of CAD (ICAD). The activation of CAD is inhibited by the inhibitor of ICAD (ICA1L). The activation of CAD is also regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The activation of CAD is inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but promoted by Bax and Bad. The activation of Endo G and CAD are involved in the apoptotic DNA fragmentation in mammalian cells.",

  "The heart is a highly active metabolic organ that requires a continuous supply of ATP to maintain its contractile function. The heart is also dependent on the ability to regenerate damaged tissue. The heart has a limited capacity to regenerate damaged tissue, but the heart is able to regenerate lost tissue in response to injury. The heart is a post-mitotic organ, but it is able to activate genes involved in cell cycle re-entry and cell division in response to injury. The heart is also a highly metabolic organ, consuming over one-third of the oxygen consumed by the body. The heart is dependent on aerobic metabolism for its energy supply, generating ATP primarily through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. The heart is also dependent on the transport of glucose and other nutrients into the heart, and the removal of metabolic by-products of metabolism. The heart is also dependent on the removal of metabolic by-products of metabolism, such as lactate, and the export of metabolic acids into the blood. The heart is also dependent on the removal of metabolic by-products of metabolism, such as lactate, and the export of metabolic acids into the blood.

  "Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine that stimulates red blood cell production in the kidneys and the bone marrow. EPO is used clinically to treat anemia caused by kidney disease or cancer chemotherapy. EPO also has neuroprotective properties in models of stroke and spinal cord injury. EPO stimulates red blood cell production by binding to the EPO receptor (EPOR) on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Binding of EPO to the EPOR activates a JAK / STAT signaling pathway that leads to increased red blood cell production. EPO also has neuroprotective properties in models of stroke and spinal cord injury. The neuroprotective effects of EPO are believed to be mediated by activation of the JAK / STAT pathway and inhibition of apoptosis. EPO also activates the PI3 kinase pathway and MAPK pathways. The activation of these pathways may be responsible for the neuroprotective properties of EPO.",
  "The coagulation cascade produces thrombin, a protease that activates platelets and endothelial cells. Thrombin also activates platelets through the Galphai-protein coupled protease-activated receptor PAR1. The protease-activated receptor PAR1 is activated by thrombin cleavage of its N-terminus, exposing a tethered ligand that activates the receptor. The tethered peptide ligand is SFLLRN in the human PAR1 sequence. The tethered peptide ligand activates PAR1, but the cleaved receptor is a fully functional receptor. The tethered peptide ligand activates PAR1 independent of thrombin binding. The tethered peptide ligand activates PAR1 in a self-sustaining manner, persisting even after the thrombin is inactivated by antithrombin. The self-sustaining activation of PAR1 by thrombin is thought to be important in the persistent platelet activation that leads to heart attack and stroke. The self-sustaining activation of PAR1 by thrombin is unique among G-protein coupled receptors. The protease activity of thrombin is normally inhibited by antithrombin in the plasma. The inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin is lost when thrombin is bound to the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. The binding of thrombin to the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells allows thrombin to diffuse away from the plasma and activate PAR1 on the surface of other cells. The activation of PAR1 by thrombin leads to platelet activation and the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. The arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandin PGG2 by the enzyme cyclooxgenase. The prostaglandin is converted to the thromboxane A2 by the enzyme thromboxane synthase. The thromboxane A2 activates the thromboxane A2 receptor on platelets, causing them to release more calcium and aggregate. The activation of PAR1 by thrombin also leads to the activation of MAP kinase in platelets. The MAP kinase pathway also appears to be involved in the activation of platelets by the thromboxane A2 receptor. The activation of PAR1 also leads to the activation of the c-fos serum response element (SRE). The activation of the c-fos SRE by PAR1 appears to be mediated by the small G-protein Rho. The activation of the SRE by PAR1 also appears to be independent of MAP kinase activation. The activation of the SRE by PAR1 appears to be mediated by the transcription factor ternary complex. The activation of the SRE by PAR1 appears to be independent of MAP kinase activation. The activation of the c-fos SRE by thrombin appears to be independent of MAP kinase activation.",
  "The olfactory receptor (OR) family of genes encodes G-protein coupled receptors that detect volatile odorants. Each receptor is expressed in a subset of neurons in the olfactory epithelium, each expressing only a single receptor type. The mechanism that restricts expression of a single receptor type to a given neuron is not known. The receptor genes are located in large clusters on the same chromosome, and the mechanism of cluster organization is not known. The mechanism of receptor choice is also not known. The expression of the OR genes is regulated by a complex set of enhancers and silencers. The olfactory receptor neurons project their axons to the glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, where they synapse with second order neurons that respond to the same odorant. The axons of neurons expressing the same receptor converge to a single glomerulus, and converge on a single glomerulus in the case of homologous receptors. The convergence of axons is thought to be mediated by the binding of a ligand to the receptor on the surface of the receptor expressing neuron, activating a receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway in the receptor neuron. The second order neurons in the olfactory pathway are the mitral cells, which send their axons to the olfactory bulb. The convergence of axons is thought to be mediated by the binding of a ligand to the receptor on the surface of the receptor expressing neuron, activating a receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway in the receptor expressing neuron. The convergence of axons is thought to be mediated by the binding of a ligand to the receptor on the receptor expressing neuron, activating a receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway in the receptor expressing neuron.",
  "Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow direct communication between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Gap junctions are formed by two-dimensional arrays of channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, allowing the direct transfer of small molecules (less than 1kDa), including ions, second messengers and other metabolites. The connexin family of proteins is the molecular constituents of gap junctions. Each connexin protein is predicted to have four transmembrane domains, an extracellular loop, an intracellular loop, an transmembrane domain, an intracellular N-terminus and C-terminus. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two hemichannels, each containing six connexins, in the plasma membrane of each adjacent cell. Each hemichannel is formed by a single connexin protein. The docking of the two hemichannels is mediated by extracellular loop-mediated and C-terminus-mediated interactions. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is essential for a variety of physiological processes, including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, the response of tissues to injury and pathological conditions, and apoptosis. Gap junction channels are dynamic structures that can be regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including transcriptional and translational control of connexin expression, post-translational modifications of connexins, and the interaction of connexins with a variety of proteins. The gating of gap junction channels is controlled by several factors, including transjunctional voltage, cytoplasmic calcium, pH, and the cytoplasmic domains of connexins. The gating of gap junction channels is also affected by the membrane potential of the coupled cells. The permeability of gap junction channels is affected by the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane in which they are formed. The permeability of gap junction channels is also affected by the type of connexin that they are made of. The permeability of gap junction channels formed by different connexins varies widely. The permeability of gap junctions formed by Cx2 6, Cx3 2, and Cx4 3 is similar, but is lower than that of channels formed by Cx4 0 or Cx4 3 / Cx4 0 heteromeric channels.",
  "The cell cycle is regulated by the coordinated activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their inhibitors (CKIs).

The p90-CKI is also regulated by phosphorylation by PKA.",
  "Calcineurin is a calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase that is involved in many cellular processes including T cell activation.

  "Growth hormone (GH) regulates growth and metabolism through the GH receptor (GHR). The GHR is a member of the cytokine receptor gene family, and like other members of this gene family, the GHR activates intracellular signaling pathways in response to GH binding. The GHR is found in many different tissues, but the major actions of GH are on growth and metabolism. The GHR is a single transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain that is required for signaling. The cytoplasmic domain of the GHR is required for signaling, but is not itself a kinase. The JAK2 tyrosine kinase is associated with the GHR and is activated by GH.

  "The endosomal system is a major sorting compartment for proteins in the secretory and endocytic pathways. The early endosome (EE) is the entry point of the endocytic pathway and is the site of sorting for proteins to be recycled to the cell surface (RE) or targeted to the lysosome (LE). The maturation of the early endosome is accompanied by the acquisition of specific proteins and lipids. The acquisition of the FYVE-domain protein EEA1 and the GTPase Rab5 mark the beginning of the maturation of the EE. The acquisition of Rab4 marks the beginning of the recycling pathway. The acquisition of Rab11 marks the maturation of the RE. The LE is characterized by the presence of Rab7 and the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). The sorting of membrane proteins into ILVs is a key feature of this pathway. The intraluminal vesicles are formed by invagination of the limiting membrane of the endosome and the subsequent budding of the vesicles into its lumen. The sorting of membrane proteins into the intraluminal vesicles is a selective process that is dependent on the presence of specific sorting motifs in the cytosolic domain of the proteins. The formation of intraluminal vesicles is a prerequisite for the degradation of the protein in the lysosome. The intraluminal vesicles are formed by the invagination of the limiting membrane of the endosome and the subsequent budding of the vesicles into the lumen of the endosome. The intraluminal vesicles are released into the endosomal lumen by fusion with the lysosome. The fusion of the intraluminal vesicles with the lysosome is mediated by the protein complex ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III.",
  "Cell-cell adhesion is essential for a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, immune function, and tissue remodeling. Cadherins are a family of cell surface glycoproteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell adhesion. At the molecular level, cadherins mediate cell adhesion by forming calcium-dependent, homophilic bonds between cells. Disruption of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is associated with tumor formation and metastasis. At the cellular level, cadherin-mediated adhesion is associated with changes in the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of actin-based structures such as filopodia and lamellipodia.

  "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder characterized by hypertrophy with histological and clinical features of hypertrophy that are hypertrophy disproportionate to recognized causes of pressure or volume overload. HCM is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 500. It is caused by mutations in genes that encode contractile proteins, sarcomere-associated proteins, or cytoskeletal proteins. The majority of mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-TPM1), and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) genes are missense mutations, and are predicted to result in single amino acid substitutions. The mutant proteins may disrupt the normal structure and function of the sarcomere, leading to an imbalance in the energy supply and utilization in the heart. The imbalance in energy supply and utilization may also result in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, which may further activate the contractile proteins and cause myocardial hypertrophy. The increased intracellular calcium concentration may also activate the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK-II), which may be involved in the development of myocardial hypertrophy.",
  "The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of secreted proteins regulates a variety of cellular processes including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix production. The TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII) is a serine / threonine kinase that heterodimerizes with type I receptors to transduce TGF-beta signals. Upon ligand binding, the type I receptor phosphorylates and activates the type II receptor. Activated type I receptor phosphorylates downstream signaling molecules, including receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads). Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the type I receptor and form complexes with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4, which are then translocated into the nucleus to regulate transcription. Non-Smad pathways include the activation of the small G protein Ras and the subsequent activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK and JNK cascades. Activated Ras stimulates the formation of the Raf-1-MEK-1-ERK and p130cas-dependent JNK kinase cascades. Activated ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors ELK-1 and c-Jun, respectively. JNK phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor ATF2. Smad-independent pathways include the activation of the small G protein RhoA and its downstream kinase ROCK. TGF-beta induces the formation of a complex between the adapter protein SARA and Smad2 / 3 in the early endosome. Smad-SARA interaction facilitates Smad2 / 3 phosphorylation by the type I receptor and subsequent Smad oligomerization and nuclear translocation.",
  "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the clonal proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells blocked at various stages of differentiation. The development of AML is thought to require two events: one leading to the immortalization of hematopoietic progenitor cells and the other conferring self-renewal capacity. In approximately 5 0% of patients with de novo AML, chromosomal translocations result in the production of chimeric fusion genes that deregulate proliferation and / or block differentiation. In the remaining cases, additional mutations are required to cooperate with fusion genes in the development of AML. These additional mutations include those that activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the RAS pathway.",
  "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved signaling pathway that is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. The pathway is initiated by the activation of cell surface receptors, such as tyrosine kinase receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and cytokine receptors, by their respective ligands. The activated receptors recruit the Grb2-Sos complex to the plasma membrane, where Sos activates Ras by exchanging GDP for GTP. Ras activates Raf, a MAPKKK, which activates MEK, a MAPKK, which in turn activates the MAPKs, ERK1 and ERK2. The MAPKs regulate a variety of cellular processes including transcription, translation, and cytoskeletal reorganization. The ERK5 / Big-MAPK is activated by MEK5 and not by Ras, and is regulated by oxidative stress. ERK5 / Big-MAPK is involved in cell survival and proliferation.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGFR is activated by binding of its ligands, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). The EGFR is widely expressed in normal epithelial cells and its activation is involved in a variety of cellular responses, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival. Overexpression of the EGFR or its ligands is associated with a variety of human cancers, including those of the lung, breast, colon, and bladder. The EGFR is a therapeutic target in cancer, and several anti-EGFR agents are in clinical trials. The ErbB family of receptors includes four closely related receptors, EGFR (ErbB-1), ErbB-2 (HER2 / neu), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4). These receptors are composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain with a carboxyl-terminal tail. Binding of ligand to the EGFR or ErbB-2 results in the formation of receptor homo- or heterodimers, which in turn leads to activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and phosphorylation of the receptor and downstream signaling molecules. Several signaling pathways are activated by the EGFR, including the ras-raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) / Akt pathway, and janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway.",
  "The beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) is a G-protein coupled receptor that mediates the physiological effects of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline. The betaAR is the major cardiac betaAR and is the target of beta-blockers used to treat heart disease. Agonists of the betaAR stimulate the production of cAMP and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates a variety of proteins to alter their activity. The beta1AR is the predominant betaAR subtype in the heart and couples to Gs to activate the Gs / adenylyl cyclase / cAMP / PKA pathway. The beta2AR couples to Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and the production of cAMP. PKA phosphorylates the beta1AR and the beta2AR to desensitize their response to agonist. The beta1AR is also regulated by receptor internalization through clathrin-coated pits. The beta1AR is rapidly internalized in response to agonist binding, dephosphorylated in early endosomes, and recycled back to the plasma membrane. The beta2AR is more slowly internalized and is recycled to the plasma membrane. The rapid desensitization and internalization of the beta1AR may serve to limit the response to sustained agonist stimulation. The beta2AR is thought to desensitize more slowly than the beta1AR because it is more slowly internalized. The beta1AR is also regulated by receptor down-regulation, in which the number of receptors on the cell surface is reduced by prolonged agonist stimulation. The beta1AR is also regulated by agonist-induced phosphorylation by G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRKs are a family of kinases that specifically phosphorylate agonist occupied GPCRs to initiate a second messenger response. GRKs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and are involved in the regulation of GPCR signaling.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGFR is activated by binding of its ligands, including EGF, TGFalpha, and amphiregulin. The binding of these ligands to the EGFR induces receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in receptor autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues. These phosphotyrosines serve as binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. The binding of these proteins to the activated EGFR regulates a number of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. The binding of the adaptor protein Grb-2 to pY1 1 7 3 activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, which leads to cell proliferation. The binding of the adaptor protein Shc to pY1 0 6 8 and pY1 0 8 6 activates the Ras-p38 pathway, which leads to cell proliferation and differentiation. The binding of the adaptor protein Nck to pY2 0 4 7 and pY2 0 5 4 activates the small G-protein Rac1, which leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton and changes in cell migration. The binding of the adaptor protein Crk to pY1 1 4 8 and pY1 1 9 7 activates the Map kinase pathway, which leads to cell proliferation and survival. The binding of the phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCgamma 1) to pY7 7 1 activates the phosphatidylinositol pathway, which leads to cell proliferation and survival. The binding of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to pY1 0 6 8 and pY1 1 7 3 activates the Ras-Map kinase pathway, which leads to cell proliferation and survival.",
  "The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is a key regulator of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Src is activated by a variety of cell surface receptors, including growth factor receptors, integrins and G-protein coupled receptors. Src phosphorylates a number of substrates, including the PDGF receptor, FAK, CAS, paxillin, and other signaling molecules. Src activity is required for cellular transformation by many oncogenes, and inhibition of Src activity blocks the transformed phenotype. Src activity is also required for normal development, as mice lacking functional Src are not viable. Src activity is elevated in a variety of human cancers, and Src activity is required for metastasis of some tumors. Src activity is also required for osteoclast function, and mice lacking Src have a severe osteopetrosis due to a defect in osteoclast function.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland in response to a variety of stimuli, including metabolic status, stress, and central nervous system stimuli. GH acts on multiple tissues to produce a variety of responses, including growth and metabolism. The actions of GH are mediated by the growth hormone receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. The GHR is a heterodimer, with one molecule of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases bound to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Binding of GH to the receptor causes autophosphorylation of the receptor-associated JAK kinases, and phosphorylation of the GHR and the GHR-associated signaling proteins. The STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family of transcription factors are phosphorylated by JAK kinases in response to GH, and are involved in transcriptional activation by GH. The Ras / Raf / MAP kinase pathway is also activated by GH, and contributes to the activation of transcription by GH. The PI3 kinase pathway is also activated by GH, and contributes to the activation of transcription by GH. One of the targets of the PI3 kinase pathway is the protein kinase AKT / PKB, which is phosphorylated and activated by GH. AKT phosphorylates and inactivates the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1, and contributes to the activation of transcription by GH of some genes. AKT also phosphorylates and activates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), increasing production of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a key mediator of the metabolic actions of GH, and AKT may contribute to the metabolic actions of GH by increasing production of NO.",
  "The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins plays a critical role in development of many tissues and organs. Hh signaling is active in the developing CNS, where it is involved in proliferation of neuronal precursor cells. In adults, Hh signaling is active in stem cells in the skin, muscle, and gut. Defects in Hh signaling are associated with birth defects in humans, including holoprosencephaly, cyclopia, and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. Hh signaling is also associated with cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. The pathway is activated by binding of Hh to its receptor, Patched (Ptc). Ptc releases Smoothened (Smo), allowing it to transduce a signal to the glioma-associated oncogene (Gli) family of transcription factors. The pathway is repressed by the Hh receptor Ptc, and by Hip1, a protein that interacts with Hh.",
  "N-linked glycosylation is the attachment of oligosaccharides to asparagine residues in proteins through an N-glycosidic bond. N-glycans are classified into three types: high-mannose, complex and hybrid. The core N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is common to all three types. The outer chains of complex N-glycans are branched from this core and are modified with various monosaccharides, including galactose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), fucose, and sialic acid. N-glycans play an important role in protein folding, quality control, and cell-cell recognition. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors that includes brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the nervous system. NGF is required for the survival of specific populations of neurons during development. NGF also induces the differentiation and growth of sensory neurons. NGF binds to the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase and activates signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The p75 subunit of PI-3 kinase is activated by NGF and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. AKT activation by NGF leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD. NGF also activates the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through the Shc adaptor protein and Grb2 / Sos to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) pathway is also activated by NGF and leads to the release of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The activation of these pathways by NGF leads to the regulation of cellular functions such as survival, proliferation and differentiation.",
  "The growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells are regulated by a variety of cytokines. The cytokine receptors that stimulate the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells fall into two broad categories: those that are coupled to the Jak / Stat pathway and those that are coupled to the ras / map kinase pathway. The receptors of the latter group include the receptors for colony stimulating factors, the interleukin 3 receptor, the interleukin 5 receptor, the GM-CSF receptor, and the receptor for the stem cell factor. The receptors for these cytokines lack intrinsic kinase activity but are associated with a tyrosine kinase (or associated tyrosine kinase), the Janus kinase (JAK). Binding of the cytokine to its receptor causes the associated JAK to phosphorylate itself and the receptor. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor then serve as binding sites for src homology 2 (SH2) containing proteins, including the STAT transcription factors. The binding of STAT proteins to the receptor is then followed by STAT phosphorylation by JAK and its dimerization. The dimerization of STAT proteins causes their nuclear translocation and activation of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. The receptors for the cytokines of the Jak / Stat family are found in many cell types and are involved in a variety of cellular responses including the response of hematopoietic cells to cytokines. The receptors of the ras / map kinase pathway are also found in many cell types and are involved in the cellular response to growth factors and hormones. Binding of growth factors to their receptor causes the activation of a membrane associated tyrosine kinase, the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (GFR-TK). The GFR-TK phosphorylates a variety of cellular substrates including the GFR-TK itself. One of the substrates of the GFR-TK is Shc, a protein that binds to the activated GFR-TK and that brings into play the ras / map kinase pathway. The ras / map kinase pathway is involved in the cellular response to growth factors and hormones.",
  "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a cytokine that plays a key role in inflammation. The IL-1 receptor is a member of the immunoglobin receptor family and is activated by the binding of IL-1 to the IL-1R1 receptor. The IL-1R1 receptor is constitutively associated with the protein MyD8 8. Upon IL-1 binding, MyD8 8 recruits IRAK to the receptor complex and activates IRAK. IRAK activates TRAF6, which in turn activates the TAK1 kinase. TRAF6 also activates the NF-kB and JNK pathways. The activation of TAK1 leads to the activation of the MKK3 / MKK6 and MKK4 / MKK7 kinases, which activate the MAP kinases JNK and p3 8. The activation of NF-kB and AP-1 by IL-1 leads to the expression of genes involved in inflammation.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes HER2 / neu (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4). EGFR is widely expressed in epithelial tissues and is activated by binding of its ligands, including EGF, TGFa, HB-EGF and others. Ligand binding causes receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor and the recruitment of signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains to the receptor. These include the adaptor proteins GRB2 and SHC, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and -2. These molecules are involved in the activation of the RAS / RAF / MEK / ERK and the PI3K / AKT pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival. The GRB2-SOS-RAS pathway leads to the activation of the RAF / MEK / ERK kinase cascade, which regulates cell proliferation. The PI3K / AKT pathway leads to cell survival. The GAB1 adaptor protein is phosphorylated by the receptor tyrosine kinases and recruits the regulatory subunit of PI3K to the plasma membrane. PI3K activation leads to the phosphorylation and activation of AKT, which in turn phosphorylates and regulates a variety of substrates to promote cell survival and proliferation. The phosphorylation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 by the receptor tyrosine kinases also contributes to cell proliferation and survival.",
  "The heart is a highly-ordered, contractile organ that pumps blood throughout the body. The heart is a complex organ with a wide spectrum of functions. The heart is composed of four major cell types: myocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipocytes. Cardiac myocytes are the major cell type in the heart and are responsible for the mechanical and electrical activities of the heart. Cardiac myocytes are electrically excitable and respond to electrical stimuli by generating action potentials. The excitation is triggered by the influx of extracellular Ca2 + through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2 + channels (VDCCs), which are activated by membrane depolarization. The Ca2 + influx triggers the release of Ca2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through the ryanodine receptor (RYR) Ca2 + release channels. The Ca2 + released from the SR subsequently activates the myofilament-bound troponin C (TnC) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), leading to the rapid development of force. The Ca2 + influx through VDCCs and the release of Ca2 + from the SR are essential for the contraction of cardiac myocytes. The heart also has a mechanism to terminate the contraction of cardiac myocytes, known as Ca2 + -dependent inactivation (CDI). CDI is mediated by the binding of Ca2 + to calmodulin (CaM), which binds to the C-terminal region of the L-type Ca2 + channel. The binding of Ca2 + to CaM dissociates the CaM-bound C-terminal region of the L-type Ca2 + channel, resulting in the termination of Ca2 + influx through the channel. Fibroblasts are involved in the structural integrity of the heart and secrete various growth factors and cytokines. Fibroblasts also play a role in the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Cardiac fibroblasts are activated by various stimuli, such as stretch, angiotensin II, and catecholamines, and proliferate, synthesize and remodel the extracellular matrix.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates growth in children and adults. The actions of GH are mediated by the GH receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Binding of GH to the GHR activates the JAK / STAT signaling pathway, which leads to the regulation of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation. In addition to the JAK / STAT pathway, GH also activates the MAPK pathway, including the Erk1 / Erk2, Jnk and p3 8 pathways. The activation of the MAPK pathway by GH is independent of the JAK / STAT pathway and plays a role in proliferation and differentiation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is also activated by GH and plays a role in proliferation and differentiation. The PI3K pathway is activated by many growth factors and cytokines and is involved in many cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. The PI3K pathway is activated by GH through the binding of the adaptor protein Shc to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the GHR. Once activated, PI3K phosphorylates the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates the serine / threonine kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B. AKT is a key component of the PI3K pathway and is activated by phosphorylation on threonine 3 0 8 by PDK1 and on serine 4 7 3 by the kinase complex mTORC2. AKT regulates many cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. One of the targets of AKT is the forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors. AKT phosphorylates and inactivates FoxO, causing its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is unable to regulate gene expression. In the nucleus, FoxO factors activate the transcription of genes involved in apoptosis, stress resistance, metabolism and cell cycle arrest. The activation of AKT by GH through the PI3K pathway may play a role in the anti-apoptotic effects of GH.",
  "The binding of beta-arrestin to agonist-occupied GPCRs leads to the recruitment of the protein kinase c-Src to the receptor-arrestin complex. This leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1 and the subsequent activation of protein kinase C. The activation of this pathway is independent of G protein activation and is blocked by expression of a dominant negative mutant of the beta-arrestin 1 C-terminal domain. The activation of this pathway by beta-arrestin-bound receptors may play a role in the mitogenic effects of these receptors. The activation of this pathway by beta-arrestin-bound receptors may also play a role in the regulation of ion channel activity.

  "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled cell death program that is essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis is triggered by a variety of signals, including ligation of death receptors, activation of oncogenes, and exposure to cytotoxic agents, and is regulated by a family of proteins called caspases. Caspases are cysteine proteases that are activated by an initiating signal and then cleave other cellular proteins to cause the death of the cell. Caspases are organized into a family based on the amino acid sequence of their active site. Caspases-1, -4, -5, and -1 2 are involved in the extrinsic pathway triggered by the binding of TNF family ligands to their receptors.

  "The complement system is an important part of the innate immune system. It is activated by the classical pathway, the alternative pathway and the lectin pathway. The complement system consists of more than thirty proteins and peptides. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes by C1q. The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 in the absence of specific activators. The lectin pathway is activated by the recognition of carbohydrate structures by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or by the recognition of bacterial surface polysaccharides by the C1 complex of the complement system. Once activated, complement proteins assemble a proteolytic cascade that results in the lysis of bacteria and the opsonization of bacteria by the complement fragment C3b. The opsonization of bacteria by C3b and the recruitment of inflammatory cells by the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a enhance the elimination of bacteria by the immune system. The activation of the complement system also results in the cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin, which initiates the coagulation cascade. The activation of the coagulation system also increases the permeability of the vessel wall, which can result in the formation of clots at extravascular sites. The coagulation system also plays an important role in the regulation of the complement system. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) is a key regulator of the complement system. It inhibits the activation of the complement factors C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 by the three pathways. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) is a more recently identified inhibitor of the complement system. It inhibits the activation of the complement factors C3 and C5 by the classical and lectin pathways but not by the alternative pathway.",

  "Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is a complex organ-specific autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies directed against self-thyroid antigens (thyroglobulin and / or thyroid peroxidase) are produced. AITD is characterized by the presence of thyroid autoantibodies, thyroid autoantibodies, hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) or hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and by infiltration of the thyroid with T cells and B cells. The etiology of AITD is still unknown, but genetic factors clearly play a major role. Environmental factors, including dietary iodine intake, infections, and possibly stress, also appear to be important. In addition to the hallmark features of AITD, Graves' disease is associated with the presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHr) autoantibodies that mimic the effects of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the autoimmune attack is directed against thyroid antigens, resulting in the destruction of the thyroid and the depletion of thyroid-cell-derived thyroid hormones.",

The TGF-beta superfamily is comprised of several structurally related members, including TGF-beta, activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth and differentiation factors (GDFs). These factors exert their effects through binding to a heteromeric complex of type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptors phosphorylate and activate the type I receptors, which in turn phosphorylate receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs). Phosphorylated R-SMADs associate with the co-factor SMAD4 and the complex translocates into the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences and interacting with various transcription factors.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that regulates growth and metabolism. In addition to its endocrine actions, GH has important actions on cells in the immune system and in the brain. The actions of GH are mediated by the GH receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Binding of GH to the GHR activates the JAK / STAT signaling pathway. In addition to activating the JAK / STAT pathway, GH activates the MAPK pathway and the PI 3-kinase pathway. The activation of these pathways by GH is rapid and transient, with activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway and MAPK pathway being maximal within 1-5 min of GH treatment and returning to basal levels by 3 0 min. The PI 3-kinase pathway is activated by the tyrosine kinase JAK2 that phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). The phosphorylation of IRS-1 leads to the activation of the p8 5 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and the subsequent activation of AKT, a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1. The phosphorylation of FKHRL1 by AKT leads to the translocation of FKHRL1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is sequestered by 1 4-3-3 proteins. The phosphorylation of FKHRL1 also leads to the activation of transcription of genes containing the antioxidant response element (ARE). The activation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) genes may play a role in the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions of GH. The activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by GH may also play a role in the regulation of protein synthesis by GH. The activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by GH may also play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation.

Activated AKT regulates a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell survival, and angiogenesis.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a multi-protein complex that plays a key role in the immune system. It is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens associated with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The TCR is a heterodimer of alpha and beta chains that associate non-covalently with the CD3 complex. The CD3 complex is composed of gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chains. The zeta chain is unique in that it contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that are involved in signal transduction. The activation of T cells requires the interaction of the TCR with an antigen-MHC complex and the subsequent triggering of a signal transduction pathway. The binding of antigen to the TCR induces the phosphorylation of the CD3 zeta chain by the Src family kinase Lck. The phosphorylation of the CD3 zeta chain creates binding sites for the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-7 0. The association of ZAP-7 0 with the phosphorylated CD3 zeta chain recruits ZAP-7 0 to the plasma membrane and allows it to be phosphorylated and activated by Lck. Activated ZAP-7 0 phosphorylates downstream targets, including the adaptor LAT and the src kinase Lck. The activation of LAT and Lck leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase cascade and the calcium pathway.",
  "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer and accounts for approximately 3% of all adult malignancies. The most common histologic subtype of RCC is the clear cell RCC (CCRCC), which accounts for 75% of all renal cancers. The VHL gene is mutated or deleted in the majority of CCRCCs, leading to the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha). The accumulation of HIF-alpha leads to the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These factors promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. Papillary RCC (pRCC) accounts for approximately 1 5% of all renal cancers. The 230kD tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the c-MET proto-oncogene is mutated in approximately 20% of sporadic pRCC. The constitutive activation of c-MET leads to the constitutive activation of the downstream signaling pathways, including the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK and PI3K / Akt pathways, which are involved in cell proliferation and survival. The VHL gene product (pVHL) normally functions as a ubiquitin ligase targeting the alpha subunit of HIF for proteosomal degradation under normoxic conditions. Inactivation of pVHL leads to the accumulation of HIF-alpha, which then activates the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The EPAS1 gene, located on chromosome 14q3 2, is mutated in approximately 1 0% of sporadic CCRCCs. The EPAS1 protein is a constitutive HIF-2alpha transcriptional activator that is not regulated by pVHL. The identification of the molecular alterations in RCC has led to the development of novel targeted therapies that inhibit angiogenesis and the tyrosine kinase activity of the c-MET receptor.",
  "Ran is a small GTPase that regulates transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It is required for the formation of the mitotic spindle and the completion of mitosis. Ran regulates transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm through its interaction with transport receptors. Ran is bound to GDP in the nucleus and is converted to Ran-GTP in the cytoplasm. The Ran-GTP gradient across the nuclear envelope creates a directionality in transport through the nuclear pore complex. The gradient is disrupted when the cell enters mitosis, causing the transport receptors to release their cargo and move out of the nucleus. The mitotic role of Ran is to regulate the formation of the mitotic spindle and the completion of mitosis. The mitotic Ran-GTP signal is generated by the action of RCC1, a chromatin bound guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The mitotic role of RCC1 is to create a high concentration of Ran-GTP in the vicinity of chromosomes. The mitotic spindle forms near chromosomes, and the chromosomes stimulate the formation of Ran-GTP near the chromosomes. The spindle assembly factor (SAF) is a microtubule stabilizing protein that is stimulated by Ran-GTP. The mitotic role of Ran is to regulate the formation of the mitotic spindle and the completion of mitosis. The aurora kinase A is a serine / threonine kinase that is required for the formation of the mitotic spindle and the completion of mitosis. The aurora kinase A is stimulated by Ran-GTP near chromosomes.",
  "The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins are secreted morphogens that play a key role in development and tissue homeostasis. Wnt signaling is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptors and low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP). Wnt signaling is negatively regulated by the cytoplasmic protein Axin. In the absence of Wnt signaling, cytoplasmic beta-catenin is phosphorylated by a protein complex that includes APC, GSK-3, and CKI. Phosphorylated beta-catenin is recognized by beta-Trcp, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Wnt binding to Frizzled and LRP inhibits the degradation of beta-catenin, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus. There, beta-catenin associates with TCF / LEF transcription factors and activates transcription of Wnt target genes. Wnt signaling is also negatively regulated by members of the Dickkopf (Dkk) gene family. Dkk binds to LRP and blocks Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is also regulated by cross-talk with other signaling pathways. For example, the transcription factor NFAT is activated by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, and represses Wnt signaling by competing with TCF for beta-catenin binding. Crosstalk between Wnt and other signaling pathways is also common. For example, beta-catenin is a target of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. The transcription factor Myc is a target of the beta-catenin / TCF complex, and activates genes involved in cell proliferation such as cyclin D1 and the telomerase reverse transcriptase. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is also activated by Wnt signaling, and can oppose the proliferative effects of beta-catenin. The Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a component of the beta-catenin pathway that phosphorylates TCF / LEF family members and represses beta-catenin-dependent transcription. The Nemo-related kinase (NRK) is a close relative of NLK that is not involved in beta-catenin signaling.",
  "Cytokines are soluble proteins that are secreted by cells to communicate with their immediate environment and to coordinate responses in cells they are produced by. Cytokines are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, and immune responses.

  "The activation of neutrophils is a key component of the innate immune response to infection. The activation of neutrophils is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the expression of adhesion molecules on the neutrophil cell surface, which is essential for the migration of neutrophils to the site of infection. The activation of neutrophils also leads to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic enzymes, which are essential for the destruction of bacteria. The activation of neutrophils also leads to apoptosis of neutrophils, which is essential for the resolution of inflammation. The activation of neutrophils also leads to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are composed of chromatin and granular proteins, to immobilize and kill bacteria. The release of NETs is also essential for the resolution of inflammation. The activation of neutrophils also leads to the release of exosomes, which are membrane vesicles released from the plasma membrane. The release of exosomes is also essential for the resolution of inflammation.",
  "The cardiac myocyte is a highly specialized cell with a limited repertoire of contractile proteins and ion channels. Instead, it expresses a variety of proteins that are involved in excitation-contraction coupling. These include the sarcolemmal Na + / K + ATPase, the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2 + channel (LTCC), the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX), and the Na + / K + ATPase in the plasma membrane, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2 + release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR), the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX), and the Ca2 + ATPase (SERCA) in the SR. The main trigger for Ca2 + release from the SR is Ca2 + influx through the LTCC, which is initiated by membrane depolarization. This is mediated by the influx of Na + via the Na + / K + ATPase and the subsequent accumulation of Na + in the cytosol. The Na + in the cytosol is subsequently pumped out of the cell by the Na + / Ca2 + exchanger (NCX), which is located in the plasma membrane in exchange for one Ca2 + ion. The Ca2 + influx through the LTCC is further amplified by Ca2 + -induced Ca2 + release from the SR via the RyR. The resulting increase in cytosolic Ca2 + concentration ([Ca2 +] i) activates the contractile apparatus via binding of Ca2 + to troponin C. Upon binding, troponin C changes conformation, which leads to a further conformational change of tropomyosin and subsequent interaction with actin. This results in the exposure of the myosin binding sites on actin, which then interact with myosin, resulting in the sliding of thin and thick filaments and cardiac muscle contraction.",

  "The cell cycle is a series of coordinated events that result in the duplication of cellular components and their segregation into two daughter cells. The cell cycle is regulated by a variety of factors, including the cyclins, which are expressed in a specific phase of the cell cycle and interact with cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) to regulate the cell cycle. The CDKs are a family of serine / threonine kinases that are activated by binding to cyclins and inhibited by CDK inhibitors. The CDKs phosphorylate specific targets to regulate the cell cycle. The transition from G1 to S phase is regulated by the sequential activation of the cyclin D / CDK4 and cyclin E / CDK2 complexes. The cyclin D / CDK4 complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), releasing the transcription factor E2F and allowing transcription of genes required for S phase entry. The cyclin E / CDK2 complex further phosphorylates Rb, releasing E2F and allowing the cell cycle to progress through the G1 / S transition. The transition from G2 to M is regulated by the cyclin B / CDK1 complex. The activity of the cyclin B / CDK1 complex is regulated by the kinase Wee-1 and the phosphatase Cdc2 5c.

The TCR is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens bound to MHC molecules on the surface of other cells and transduces this recognition event into a cellular response. The interaction of the TCR with antigen-MHC complex is thought to induce a conformational change in the TCR complex that leads to the activation of the tyrosine kinase Lck, which is associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the CD3 complex. Lck phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the CD3 zeta chain, which in turn leads to the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase Zap-7 0. Zap-7 0 phosphorylates and activates other kinases involved in downstream signaling pathways.",
  "TNF is a cytokine that can be found in the serum as a result of infection or tissue damage. TNF can be produced by many different cell types in response to infection or injury.

  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors that are activated by fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPAR is a heterodimer of PPAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR). The binding of ligands to the heterodimer causes a conformational change in the receptor, which leads to the dissociation of corepressors and the association of coactivators. The binding of coactivators to PPAR leads to the recruitment of a variety of coregulators that modify chromatin structure and the activity of the transcription machinery. The expression of PPAR is regulated by a variety of factors, including the binding of PPAR to a DR1 response element in the promoter region of the gene, the presence of RXR, and the binding of PPAR to PPAR-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1).

  "The heart is an extremely efficient organ that pumps a large amount of blood to the systemic circulation to meet the needs of the entire body. The heart is a highly energy-consuming organ, consuming approximately one-third of the oxygen consumed by the body. The high energy demand of the heart is mainly due to the high-energy phosphate compounds in the heart, ATP. The heart is composed of four major types of cells: cardiomyocytes (cardiac myocytes), which are responsible for pumping the blood throughout the body, and vascular smooth muscle cells, which control the blood flow. The energy for contraction of cardiomyocytes is mainly derived from the oxidation of fatty acids and glucose. The oxidation of fatty acids produces large amounts of NADH and FADH2, which are transferred to the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the beta-oxidation pathway. The transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen via complexes I, III, and IV creates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is used by the ATP synthase (F1F0-ATP synthase) to produce ATP. The energy released by the oxidation of glucose is converted to ATP via the glycolytic pathway. The energy released by the oxidation of fatty acids and glucose is transferred to the contractile proteins in the myofibrils via the Ca (2 +) -handling system.",
  "The transcription factor NFAT is a key regulator of cytokine expression in T cells. In the absence of calcium, NFAT is phosphorylated and retained in the cytoplasm by the binding of 1 4-3-3. Increased intracellular calcium levels activate the phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The transcription factor NF-AT is also regulated by calcium, but in this case dephosphorylation by calcineurin activates NF-AT. The transcription factor NF-AT is activated by a variety of stimuli, including the T cell receptor, mitogens, and cytokines such as IL-2. NF-AT and NF-AT are activated by calcium through different pathways. The T cell receptor activates phospholipase C gamma, which cleaves membrane phospholipids to produce diacylglycerol and inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. Both of these second messengers activate the protein kinase C pathway. The calcium-dependent pathway also involves the activation of calmodulin and the serine / threonine phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, causing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The T cell receptor also activates the protein kinase C pathway, which activates NF-AT through the kinase Raf1 and the kinase map kinase 2. The activation of NF-AT and NF-AT by the T cell receptor is required for T cell activation. The activation of NF-AT and NF-AT by calcium also plays a role in the regulation of cytokine expression in T cells. The transcription factor Sp1 also plays a key role in the regulation of cytokine expression in T cells. The transcription factor NF-AT binds to the promoter region of the IL-2 gene and activates its expression. The activation of NF-AT by calcium also activates the transcription of the coactivator of Sp1, the coactivator CBP. The activation of CBP by NF-AT may play a role in the activation of other genes by NF-AT.",
  "The immune system consists of two major classes of cells, the innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, and the adaptive immune cells, such as B and T lymphocytes. The innate immune cells are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and provide a rapid response without the need for antigen-specific receptors. The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the cooperation of B and T cells. B cells produce antibodies against specific antigens, while T cells respond to specific antigens in the context of MHC molecules. The development of T cells requires the coordinated expression of a number of genes, including the rearrangement of genes encoding the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the expression of a limited set of co-receptors. The TCR is a cell-surface receptor that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for the recognition of specific peptide antigens bound to MHC molecules. The TCR is a multisubunit complex consisting of the clonotypic TCR\u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer and the CD3 subunits CD3\u03b3\u03b5, \u03b4\u03b6. The CD3 subunits are required for the efficient assembly and cell surface expression of the TCR complex, but are not themselves sufficient to transmit signals downstream. The activation of T cells requires the interaction of the TCR with peptide antigen bound to MHC (pMHC) on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. Interaction of the TCR with pMHC induces the phosphorylation of the CD3 subunits by the Lck kinase, which in turn leads to the recruitment and activation of the Syk kinase Zap7 0. The activation of Lck and Zap7 0 leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway. The activation of these pathways leads to the expression of genes involved in T-cell activation and proliferation.",
  "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The IL-2 receptor is composed of three chains, alpha (CD25), beta (CD21) and gamma (CD30). The alpha chain binds IL-2 with low affinity and is required for signaling by IL-2. The beta and gamma chains are necessary for high affinity IL-2 binding and signaling. The beta chain contains the JAK / STAT signaling pathway while the gamma chain is involved in the activation of the JAK / STAT pathway by IL-2 as well as other cytokines. The JAK / STAT pathway is activated by IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor and activating the JAK kinases. The JAK kinases phosphorylate the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor and the STAT transcription factors are recruited to the receptor complex by the phosphorylated JAK kinases. The phosphorylated STAT proteins are then activated by the JAK kinases and are able to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. The activation of the JAK / STAT pathway by IL-2 is opposed by the SOCS proteins that bind to the activated JAK kinases and the phosphorylated beta chain of the IL-2 receptor. The SOCS proteins also bind to the IL-2 receptor and block STAT activation by the IL-2 receptor. The activation of T cells by IL-2 is opposed by the actions of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. SHP-1 is activated by the TCR and dephosphorylates the IL-2 receptor and JAK kinases. The activation of T cells by IL-2 is also opposed by the actions of the phosphatase PP2A. PP2A is activated by IL-2 and dephosphorylates the JAK kinases and STAT proteins.",

When calcium levels increase, calpain is activated and cleaves p35 to release the active cdk5 kinase. The activation of cdk5 by p35 is involved in neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration. The cleavage of p35 by calpain also releases a smaller fragment (p2 5) that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). The accumulation of p2 5 causes the inappropriate activation of cdk5 and the aberrant phosphorylation of tau. The inappropriate phosphorylation of tau by cdk5 may contribute to the formation of paired helical filaments (PHFs) and the neuronal death that occurs in AD. The activation of cdk5 by p2 5 also leads to the aberrant phosphorylation of other proteins involved in neuronal function, including the the regulation of the transcription factor, CREB, and the neurofilament protein, Nf-H. The inappropriate phosphorylation of these proteins by cdk5 may contribute to the neuronal dysfunction and death that occurs in AD.",
  "The Myc transcription factor is a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Myc induces cell proliferation by increasing the rate of ribosome biogenesis through activation of RNA polymerase I and III. Myc also induces apoptosis by increasing the expression of the p53 tumor suppressor. The induction of p53 by Myc is required for Myc-induced apoptosis, and p53 activates the apoptotic program by inducing the expression of the Bax protein. The Myc-p53 pathway is activated by a variety of signals, including activated oncogenes such as ras and cdk4, and by cytokines such as TGF-beta.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a trophic factor that promotes survival and differentiation of neurons. NGF binds to TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, to initiate signaling. The NGF / TrkA signaling pathway activates the Ras / Map kinase pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway. The Ras / Map kinase pathway is involved in cell survival and differentiation. The PI3 kinase pathway is involved in cell survival.",
  "The MET receptor tyrosine kinase is a cell surface receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The HGF / MET signaling pathway plays a key role in development and in cancer. The MET receptor is activated by HGF, the only known ligand for MET. HGF binding to MET induces receptor dimerization and activation of its tyrosine kinase. The activated MET kinase phosphorylates various cellular substrates, including the Shc, Grb2, and Sos-1 complex, leading to activation of the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway and other signaling pathways. The activated MET also stimulates the PI3 kinase pathway. The activation of these signaling pathways leads to cellular responses including cell proliferation, motility, and morphogenesis. The MET receptor is also a co-receptor for the tyrosine kinase receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the only known ligand for the MET receptor. The binding of HGF to the MET receptor enhances the signaling of the MET receptor.",
  "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and activation of T cells. The IL-2 receptor is expressed on activated T cells and NK cells and consists of three subunits alpha (CD25), beta (CD21) and gamma (CD132). The gamma subunit is shared with the IL-2 receptor family members IL-4, IL-7 and IL-9. The IL-2 receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor family and is coupled to the JAK / STAT signaling pathway. Upon IL-2 binding, the JAK kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, are activated and phosphorylate the IL-2 receptor subunits. The phosphorylated receptor subunits serve as docking sites for the STAT transcription factors, which are also phosphorylated by JAK kinases. The activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell survival.",
  "The activation of neutrophils by bacterial products such as fMLP results in the production of reactive oxygen species and the release of proteolytic enzymes that can damage tissues. The production of reactive oxygen species is dependent on the activation of phospholipase A2 and the subsequent production of arachidonic acid. The release of arachidonic acid is stimulated by the activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent production of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate. The production of reactive oxygen species is dependent on the activation of the NADPH oxidase. The NADPH oxidase is a membrane-bound enzyme that is activated by the association of cytosolic factors with the membrane. The activation of the NADPH oxidase is dependent on the translocation of the cytosolic factors to the membrane. The translocation of the cytosolic factors is dependent on the activation of Rac and the MAP kinase pathway.",
  "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune disease that is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against nuclear self-antigens. The production of autoantibodies is a central feature of lupus. The presence of autoantibodies is a key feature of lupus pathogenesis. The presence of autoantibodies is associated with the presence of immune complexes (ICs) that are deposited in the kidney glomeruli and mediate renal injury. The ICs are formed by the binding of autoantibodies to self-antigens and the subsequent binding of ICs to the Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) on the surface of the neutrophils, macrophages, and other cells. The ICs are then taken up by the cells and transported to the phagolysosome, where the proteolytic activity of the proteases activates the complement system. The activation of the complement system leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9), which is responsible for the lysis of cells. Neutrophils and macrophages produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are toxic to cells. The binding of ICs to the Fc\u03b3Rs on the surface of neutrophils and macrophages also triggers the release of cytokines and chemokines, which are involved in the pathogenesis of lupus.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly regulated sequence of events that ensures the accurate duplication of DNA and the subsequent division of cells into two daughter cells. The G1 to S phase transition is a key regulatory point in the cell cycle, and is also a checkpoint at which cells can either proceed into S phase or undergo apoptosis. The G1 to S phase transition is regulated by the cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks), a family of serine / threonine kinases that are activated by association with cyclins. The activity of the Cdks is opposed by the cdk inhibitors, which include p53, p16, and the INK4 family of proteins (p15, p16, p18, and p19). The INK4 proteins bind to cdk4 and cdk6, blocking their association with D-type cyclins and inhibiting their kinase activity. The p53 protein binds to and inhibits the activity of the cyclin-Cdk4 / 6 complexes, and is itself inhibited by the p21 protein. The p21-p53-Cdk4 / 6-INK4-Rb pathway is a tumor suppressor pathway that is frequently disrupted in cancer. The Cdk inhibitors, p16 and p19, are induced by the tumor suppressor p53, and inhibit the activity of the cyclin-Cdk complexes. The p16 and p19 proteins also inhibit the degradation of p21, further increasing the inhibition of the cyclin-Cdk complexes. The Rb protein binds to the E2F transcription factors, inhibiting their activity. Phosphorylation of Rb by the cyclin-Cdk complexes causes the dissociation of Rb from E2F, allowing the transcription of genes required for S phase progression. The cyclin-Cdk inhibitors, p16 and p19, also inhibit the transcriptional activity of E2F, as well as the expression of E2F-responsive genes. The p53 protein also has transcription-independent functions, inhibiting the degradation of p21 and inducing p21-dependent apoptosis.",
  "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that signals in the brain to regulate energy intake and energy expenditure. Leptin acts on hypothalamic neurons to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure. The long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb) is required for leptin signaling. LepRb activates the transcription factors Stat3 and Stat5, which induce the expression of the neuropeptides NPY and AGRP, and inhibit the expression of the orexigenic peptides AgRP and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). Leptin also acts directly on POMC neurons to stimulate the synthesis and release of the anorectic peptide alpha-MSH. The melanocortin receptors are Gs-coupled and stimulate the synthesis and release of cAMP. The anorectic effects of leptin are blocked by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent signaling, and are also blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA). Leptin also activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and inhibitors of this pathway block the anorectic effects of leptin. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B dephosphorylates the LepRb and may inhibit LepRb signaling. The protein SOCS3 binds to LepRb and may inhibit LepRb signaling. The sympathetic nervous system regulates energy expenditure through the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic ganglia in response to leptin. Leptin activates the expression of the neuropeptide NPY in the arcuate nucleus, which stimulates the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the celiac and superior mesenteric ganglia. Norepinephrine stimulates the brown adipose tissue to produce heat through the sympathetic innervation and the release of the hormone adrenalin. The sympathetic nervous system also regulates energy intake through the release of the orexigenic and anorectic peptides from the hypothalamus.",
  "The proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades proteins in a highly selective manner. Proteins that are to be degraded by the proteasome are tagged with a chain of 7-amino-acid called ubiquitin. The proteasome is a barrel shaped structure with two distinct proteolytic activities, a chymotrypsin-like activity (cleavage after hydrophobic residues) and a trypsin-like activity (cleavage after basic residues). The proteasome is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of all cells and is responsible for most intracellular protein degradation. Proteins that are to be degraded by the proteasome are tagged with ubiquitin by a process called ubiquitination. Proteins that are to be degraded by the proteasome are first tagged with a chain of ubiquitin that is then recognized and bound by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex with two distinct proteolytic activities, a chymotrypsin-like activity and a trypsin-like activity. The proteasome is a cylindrical shaped structure with a central proteolytic core called the 20S proteasome. There are two 20S proteasomes in each 100MDa 20S proteasome. The two 20S proteasomes are stacked on each other to form a 26S proteasome. The 1 9S regulatory complex binds to the 20S proteasome to form the 2 6S proteasome. The 1 9S regulatory complex is responsible for recognizing ubiquitinated proteins, opening the gate of the 20S proteasome, and deubiquinating proteins that are to be degraded. The ubiquitin-like protein called ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme (Uba2L) is also part of the 20S proteasome. The proteasome is responsible for degrading damaged or improperly folded proteins that are not in the process of being used and is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, and antigen presentation. The dysregulation of proteasome activity has been implicated in a number of diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.",
  "The p34cdc2 protein kinase (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle. In its active form CDK1 is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (CDK1) and a regulatory subunit (cyclin B). CDK1 / cyclin B is required for cells to pass through the G2 / M transition of the cell cycle. The activity of CDK1 / cyclin B is regulated by the levels of cyclin B and the phosphorylation status of CDK1. The activation of CDK1 / cyclin B is triggered by the removal of inhibitory phosphate groups from CDK1 by the CDC2 5C phosphatase. The degradation of cyclin B is triggered by the APC / C ubiquitin ligase. The activity of the APC / C is regulated by the proteins of the Fizzy / Cdc2 0 family. The activity of the PKA regulatory subunit is inhibited by the PKA regulatory subunit RIIbeta. The PKA catalytic subunit is released from the PKA regulatory subunit when cAMP levels increase in the cell. The release of the PKA catalytic subunit activates CDK1 / cyclin B by reversing the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1. The PKA catalytic subunit also activates the MAPK pathway.",
  "Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland in response to hyperosmolality or hypovolemia. Vasopressin regulates water homeostasis by controlling water reabsorption in kidneys collecting duct cells. Vasopressin binds to V2 receptors in the collecting duct cells to increase cAMP levels. Elevated cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates aquaporin-2 (AQP2), increasing its water channel activity and inducing its accumulation in the apical plasma membrane. This results in water flow into the urinary bladder and the final concentration of urine. Vasopressin also binds to V1a receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasoconstriction and water excretion in response to reduced blood volume.",
  "The interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium is a key step in the inflammatory response. The first step in this process is the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium. Rolling is mediated by the interaction of the leukocyte adhesion molecule P-, E-, and L-selectins with their ligands on the endothelium. Rolling leukocytes are then activated by chemokines and other inflammatory signals, and arrest at the site of inflammation. The interaction of LFA-1 on leukocytes with its ligand ICAM-1 on the endothelium mediates the firm adhesion of leukocytes. The arrest of leukocytes at the site of inflammation is accompanied by the upregulation of additional adhesion molecules, including Mac-1 and VLA-4. The interaction of Mac-1 with its ligand ICAM-1 mediates the firm adhesion of leukocytes. VLA-4 interacts with its ligand VCAM-1 on the endothelium and may also mediate firm adhesion. The arrest of leukocytes at the site of inflammation is followed by diapedesis, the movement of leukocytes from the blood into the underlying tissue. The interaction of PECAM-1 on leukocytes with PECAM-1 on the endothelium mediates the migration of leukocytes across the endothelium.",
  "Translation of mRNA into protein is a fundamental process in all cells. Translation is a multistep process that begins with the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAi to the 4 0S ribosomal subunit to form the 4 3S preinitiation complex. The 4 3S preinitiation complex then moves along the mRNA and encounters the initiation triplet AUG to form the first peptide bond. The binding of the 6 0S subunit to the 4 8S preinitiation complex then leads to the formation of the 8 0S initiation complex, which is ready to begin another round of translation. Regulation of this process occurs at many steps. One of the key regulatory steps is the binding of the initiation factor eIF4B to the 4 0S subunit. Phosphorylation of eIF4B by the kinase MNK-1 stimulates its activity. Translation is inhibited by the binding of 4E-BP to the initiation factor eIF4E. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP by the kinase mTOR releases 4E-BP to bind to eIF4E and activate translation. Translation of mRNAs with long 5 'untranslated regions (UTRs) is particularly sensitive to regulation by eIF-4E. Another key regulatory step is the binding of the 6 0S subunit to the 4 8S preinitiation complex. This is inhibited by the binding of G7BP to the initiation factor eIF7. eIF-3 and the ternary complex (consisting of Met-tRNAi, GTP and the initiation factor eIF2) also play important roles in this step. Translation of some mRNAs is also regulated at the level of translation initiation. For example, the translation of the c-myc and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNAs is stimulated by the binding of the protein complex hnRNP A1 to the 5' UTRs of these mRNAs.",
  "The inflammatory response is a complex response involving the release of cytokines, the recruitment of leukocytes, and the activation of macrophages. The response is initiated by the recognition of foreign agents by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The response is also regulated by the expression of negative regulators such as SOCS. The activation of macrophages by LPS is a model of the inflammatory response. The response is regulated by the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kB. The induction of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 is regulated by AP-1 and NF-kB. The induction of SOCS by LPS is a negative feedback loop that regulates the response. The activation of macrophages by LPS is also regulated by the protein kinase C pathway. The activation of macrophages by TNF-alpha is also regulated by the protein kinase C pathway. The activation of macrophages by viruses is also regulated by the protein kinase C pathway. The protein kinase C pathway regulates the activation of macrophages by both LPS and TNF-alpha. The regulation of the activation of macrophages by the protein kinase C pathway is through the regulation of the expression of SOCS. The activation of macrophages by viruses is also regulated by the protein kinase C pathway.",
  "The Krebs cycle is the central pathway of aerobic metabolism and provides energy in the form of NADH and FADH2. The Krebs cycle starts with the oxidation of acetyl-CoA to CO2 in the Krebs cycle. Acetyl-CoA is derived from pyruvate in glycolysis and from fatty acids in beta oxidation. The first reaction of the cycle is the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to form citrate. The next step is the oxidative decarboxylation of citrate to isocitrate. Icosate is then converted to alpha-ketoglutarate, which is a precursor of glutamate and glutamine. The cycle continues with the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to form succinyl-CoA, which is converted to succinate by a series of reactions. Succinate is a precursor of both fumarate and malate. Malate is oxidized to pyruvate and oxidized to CO2. Fumarate is reduced to generate NADH. The cycle is completed with the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and the reduction of CO2 to form a complete cycle of CO2 and water. The Krebs cycle is completed with the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, which is converted to glutamate. The enzymes of the Krebs cycle are found in the mitochondrial matrix. The Krebs cycle is a major source of NADH for the electron transport chain. The oxidation of NADH by the electron transport chain transfers protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, generating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis by F0F1-ATPase. The Krebs cycle also provides precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, and other metabolites. Defects in the Krebs cycle have been associated with a number of human diseases. One of the most severe defects is the hereditary disorder, fumaric aciduria. Patients with fumaric aciduria suffer from mental retardation, hypotonia, and skin lesions. The disease is caused by a deficiency in fumarase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of fumarate to malate. The lack of fumarase results in the accumulation of fumarate and depletion of malate. The accumulation of fumarate and depletion of malate may be responsible for the symptoms of fumaric aciduria.",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles in animal cells serving as the cell's main digestive compartment. They contain more than 4 5 hydrolases involved in the degradation of all forms of cellular macromolecules. The major functions of the lysosomal hydrolases are the degradation of macromolecules taken up from the extracellular space by endocytosis and phagocytosis, and the digestion of macromolecules delivered by autophagy. The degradation of macromolecules takes place in the intralysosomal compartment, and is facilitated by the acidic environment of this organelle (pH approximately 5). The acidic environment is maintained by the action of a vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase), which pumps protons into the lumen of lysosomes in a variety of organisms. The v-ATPase is a multisubunit enzyme complex consisting of a peripheral membrane subunit (V0V1) and a membrane-integral subunit (V0). The assembly of the V0 and V0V1 subunits is regulated by a group of proteins, including the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR), which binds newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes and transports them to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). After their delivery to the TGN, lysosomal enzymes are modified by the addition of mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are recognized by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated pathway. Once they reach the lysosomes, the enzymes are activated by intralysosomal proteases and are subsequently translocated to the cytosol by the lysosomal membrane protein, cathepsin L. Finally, the digested macromolecules are released into the cytosol through permeases in the membrane of lysosomes.",
  "The selectin family of adhesion molecules includes E-selectin (also known as ESL-1, ELAM-1, and SECAM-1), P-selectin (also known as PADGEM, GMP-1 4 0, and LPSECAM), and L-selectin (also known as CDw5 2). These molecules are expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells, platelets, and some leukocytes and are involved in the initial attachment of leukocytes to the endothelium during the inflammatory response. P-selectin is stored in secretory vesicles in platelets and is rapidly translocated to the cell surface upon platelet activation. L-selectin is expressed on the leukocyte surface and is involved in the initial attachment of leukocytes to the endothelium during the inflammatory response. All three of these molecules are type I membrane proteins with an N-terminal extracellular domain that contains a number of calcium-binding sites, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain of the selectins binds to carbohydrate ligands on the surface of other cells or in the extracellular matrix. P-selectin binds to sialyl Lewis x (NeuAc alpha 23Gal beta 144 [Fuc alpha 13sLe x]) on the surface of activated endothelial cells and leukocytes. E-selectin binds to sialyl Lewis a (NeuAc alpha 23Gal beta 14Glc-1Cer) on the surface of activated endothelial cells and leukocytes. L-selectin binds to the sulfated carbohydrate ligands, sialyl Lewisx (NeuAc alpha 23Gal beta 14GlcNAc beta 36GalNAc-1Ser) and sialyl Lewisa (NeuAc alpha 23Gal beta 14Glc-1Cer). The binding of selectins to their ligands is calcium dependent and is mediated by an amino acid sequence in the lectin domain called the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The binding of selectins to their ligands is reversible and is regulated by the concentration of calcium ions in the fluid phase. The binding of selectins to their ligands is also regulated by the density of ligands on the cell surface. The binding of selectins to their ligands is also regulated by the expression of the appropriate ligands on the cell surface. The binding of selectins to their ligands is also regulated by the expression of appropriate carbohydrate ligands. The binding of selectins to their ligands is also regulated by the expression of the appropriate carbohydrate ligands.",
  "The inflammatory response is a complex process involving the interaction of a variety of cell types and the production of a broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory response is initiated by the recognition of foreign agents by the innate immune system, which includes macrophages and neutrophils. The activation of macrophages and neutrophils by inflammatory signals leads to the production of reactive oxygen species and the release of proteolytic enzymes to kill invading microorganisms. Macrophages and neutrophils also secrete cytokines and chemokines to recruit other inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation. The inflammatory response is down-regulated by the release of anti-inflammatory molecules, such as prostaglandins and lipoxins, and by the resolution of inflammation. This process is mediated by the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-beta, and the synthesis of lipid mediators, such as lipoxins.",
  "The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, ephrins, are involved in a variety of developmental processes, including the formation of the nervous system, the vascular system, and the mammary gland. The Eph kinases are also involved in a variety of pathological processes, including tumor formation and metastasis. Eph kinases are activated by ephrins on the surface of adjacent cells, and transmit signals into the cell that is in close proximity to the ephrins. The ephrins are also membrane bound, but are attached to the membrane by a GPI anchor. Signaling by ephrins is bidirectional, with ephrins on the surface of one cell signaling into the receptor on an adjacent cell, and the receptor in turn signaling into the ephrin bearing cell. The Eph kinases are associated with the actin cytoskeleton, and may signal through small GTPases of the Rho family to alter cytoskeletal structure. In addition, ephrins may signal into the cell that is in close proximity to the ephrins through integrins, which are cell adhesion molecules that bind extracellular matrix proteins.",
  "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) / AKT pathway is a key regulator of cell survival. AKT is a serine / threonine kinase that is activated by phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation. AKT activation leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21-Cip, and the pro-apoptotic factor, p27-Kip. AKT also phosphorylates and activates the anti-apoptotic factor, BAD. AKT activation also leads to inhibition of the transcription factor, NF-kB, and blocks the induction of apoptosis by TNF. AKT activation also blocks apoptosis induced by Fas, TNF and other factors. The anti-apoptotic activity of AKT is opposed by the p21-Cip / WAF1 factor. The p21-Cip / WAF1 factor is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks cell cycle progression when expressed. AKT activation blocks p21-Cip / WAF1 mediated cell cycle arrest. The p21-Cip / WAF1 block is also reversed by the p27-Kip factor. The p27-Kip factor is a kinase that phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein and blocks cell cycle progression. The p27-Kip factor is also an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic factor, p21-Cip / WAF1.",
  "Mitochondria play a key role in apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c and other factors to activate caspases. Cytochrome c is released from mitochondria in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 to form a complex that activates caspase-9. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates apoptosis by controlling the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Bax and Bak are pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family that cause cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family that inhibit apoptosis induced by Bax and Bak. The mechanism by which Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit apoptosis is not yet clear, but they may act by binding to Bax and Bak and preventing them from inducing cytochrome c release. Bid is a Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis induced by Bcl-2 antagonists such as Bax and Bcl-2 antagonists such as Fas. Activation of Fas by Fas ligand or other ligands can also induce apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway. Bid is cleaved by caspase-8 to form a truncated Bid (tBid) that can induce cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit apoptosis induced by tBid, but not by Bax.",
  "Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and animals. The infectious agent is the prion protein (PrP) scrapie, which is a beta-sheet-rich isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrP C). The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc is thought to occur post-translationally, and is associated with the accumulation of protease-resistant PrP Sc in the brain. The molecular pathogenesis of prion diseases is not well understood, but may involve a toxic gain-of-function of PrP Sc, or a loss-of-function of PrP C. The toxicity of PrP Sc may be related to its tendency to form aggregates, and to its interference with cellular protein quality control systems. The conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc may also result in the loss of the neuroprotective function of PrP C. Mice lacking PrP are resistant to prion disease, indicating that PrP is essential for the development of prion diseases. Mice lacking PrP also show a variety of subtle phenotypes, including a reduced level of cerebellar granule cells, altered behavior, and a reduced level of copper in the brain.",
  "BCR is a cytoplasmic protein that is expressed in B cells and that is involved in B cell development. The BCR is a heterodimer consisting of two polypeptide chains, the membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) and the Ig-alpha / Ig-beta heterodimer. The mIg is responsible for antigen recognition and the Ig-alpha / Ig-beta heterodimer is responsible for transducing the signal. The BCR transmits signals in response to antigen binding through a variety of pathways. The most important of these pathways is the Ras pathway. The BCR activates Ras through the Syk tyrosine kinase and the adaptor proteins Dok-1 and Dok-2. Ras is activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1, which is recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to phosphorylated Dok-1 and Dok-2. Sos-1 activates Ras by converting it from the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active form. Ras activates Raf-1, which in turn activates the MAP kinases, Erk1 and Erk2. The Erks phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor AP-1, which regulates the expression of many genes. AP-1 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The activation of the Ras pathway by the BCR is opposed by the Csk tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates the inhibitory tyrosines in BCR complex components. Csk is recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to the phosphorylated inhibitory tyrosines in BCR complex components. The balance of Csk recruitment and Dok-1 / 2 phosphorylation determines the level of Ras activation by the BCR. The Csk / BCR complex pathway also regulates the activation of the transcription factor NFAT. The BCR also activates the PI3 kinase pathway. PI3 kinase phosphorylates the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol to produce phosphatidylinositol-3, 4,5-trisphosphate. PI3 kinase is recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine in BCR complex components. Phosphatidylinositol-3, 4,5-trisphosphate binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of the serine / threonine kinase Akt / PKB, which is also recruited to the membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4,5-trisphosphate. Akt / PKB is a kinase that phosphorylates and activates several transcription factors, including NF-kB, that regulate the expression of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation. The PI3 kinase pathway also activates mTOR, a kinase that regulates translation. The activation of the PI3 kinase pathway by the BCR may also contribute to the activation of NF-kB. The balance of the activation of the Ras and PI3 kinase pathways by the BCR may determine the fate of the cell receiving the BCR signal. Cells receiving the BCR signal that do not activate the PI3 kinase pathway rapidly die by apoptosis. Cells receiving the BCR signal that activate both the Ras and PI3 kinase pathways survive and proliferate.",
  "The Cbl protein is an adaptor protein that interacts with a variety of signaling molecules. Cbl has an N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubch5c. c-Cbl is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to growth factor stimulation, and this phosphorylation is required for its interaction with the Met and EGF receptors. The Cbl-b isoform lacks the C-terminal domain and does not interact with the Met or EGF receptors. The interaction of Cbl with the EGF receptor is not dependent on receptor kinase activity, but does require receptor ubiquitination. The interaction of Cbl with the Met receptor requires the tyrosine kinase domain and the Cbl binding site is phosphorylated on tyrosine 1 0 0 3. Cbl also interacts with the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1) and this interaction requires the receptor kinase domain and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. The interaction of Cbl with the PDGFR\u03b1 does not require receptor ubiquitination. The interaction of Cbl with the EGF receptor requires the tyrosine kinase domain and the proline-rich region of Cbl, but does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. The interaction of Cbl with the PDGF receptor does not require the tyrosine kinase domain, but does require the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. The interaction of Cbl with the EGF and PDGF receptors requires the SH3 domains of Grb2. The interaction of Cbl with the Met receptor does not require the SH3 domains of Grb2, but does require the SH2 domain of Grb2. The interaction of Cbl with the EGF and PDGF receptors does not require the SH3 domains of Grb2, but does require the SH2 domain of Grb2. The interaction of Cbl with the Met receptor does not require the SH2 domain of Grb2. The interaction of Cbl with the EGF and PDGF receptors does not require the SH3 domain of CrkL. The interaction of Cbl with the Met receptor does not require CrkL.",
  "Insulin resistance is a key factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by a diminished ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake into muscle and to suppress hepatic glucose production. The insulin resistance of muscle is associated with a defect in insulin signaling, whereas the resistance of liver is thought to be due to increased levels of hepatic triglycerides. The molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance are still not well understood. It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors may include mutations in the insulin receptor or IRS-1, as well as mutations in the Cbl-CAP-TC1 0 pathway. Environmental factors include increased levels of circulating free fatty acids, increased levels of circulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and increased levels of homocysteine. In addition, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress have been implicated. The molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance are still not well understood. It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors may include mutations in the insulin receptor or IRS-1, as well as mutations in the Cbl-CAP-TC1 0 pathway. Environmental factors include increased levels of circulating free fatty acids, increased levels of circulating TNF-alpha, and increased levels of homocysteine. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress have also been implicated. The molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance are still not well understood. It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Molecular mechanisms include oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as impaired activation of IRS-1.",
  "Apoptosis is a genetically encoded cell death program that is activated in response to a variety of cellular signals. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspases are expressed as inactive proenzymes that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases-8, -9, and-3 are involved in apoptosis induced by the extrinsic pathway, which involves the binding of ligands to cell surface receptors. The intrinsic pathway involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to activate caspase-3 and-7. Caspases-8 and-9 both activate the effector caspases-3, -6 and-7, which in turn cleave cellular substrates to cause cell death. Caspases are inhibited by IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) family members, which include XIAP (X-linked IAP). IAP proteins bind caspases directly to inhibit their activity, and also block caspase-8 activation by TNF-family receptors. Caspases are inhibited by the IAP-family member FLIP (FLICE-like inhibitory protein), which is induced by TNF family receptors to oppose apoptosis. Caspases are also inhibited by Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2, which inhibit apoptosis by opposing the action of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Caspases are activated by two proteolytic cleavage events. The first activation event occurs at the apex of the cascade and is mediated by caspase-8 or -9. The second cleavage event is mediated by the effector caspases-3, -6 and-7.",
  "The sense of taste is mediated by specialized cells, the taste bud cells, which are found in taste buds in the oral epithelium. Taste buds are found in the epithelium of the tongue, palate and soft palate. Taste receptors are found in taste receptor cells, which are located in the basal layer of the epithelium. These cells are stimulated by tastants, which are recognized by specific taste receptors. The tastant receptors are coupled to signal transduction pathways that lead to the release of neurotransmitters from the taste cells, which in turn activate nerve fibers that carry the information about the taste quality to the brain. The tastant receptors are GPCRs. The receptors for umami (monosodium glutamate) and for sweet, sweet-umami and amino acids are coupled to the gustducin alpha-gustducin subunit. The receptors for bitter, amino acids and lipids are coupled to the G-protein alpha-subunit gustducin, but also to the G-protein beta-subunit. The receptors for salty and for acids are coupled to the G-protein alpha-subunit GNAS. The receptors for the tastants are also coupled to phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 opens ion channels in the taste cell membrane, leading to the depolarization of the cell. DAG activates protein kinase C, which may also activate the ion channels. The receptors for nucleotides are coupled to adenylate cyclase, increasing the intracellular cAMP concentration. The receptors for sugars are coupled to the G-protein alpha-subunit GNAL. The opening of the ion channels leads to the influx of cations, which depolarizes the cell and activates the nerve fibers.",
  "The exosome is a conserved, multi-subunit complex that plays a central role in RNA processing and degradation. The exosome exists in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, the exosome functions in the processing of stable RNAs, such as 5. 8S rRNA, 5S rRNA, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs, and some noncoding RNAs, such as the MRP and RNase P RNAs. In the cytoplasm, the exosome functions in the turnover of normal mRNAs and aberrant mRNAs that are generated by aberrant translation or transcription. The exosome contains a ring-shaped, catalytically inactive core complex, which is composed of three proteins (Rrp4 1, Rrp4 2 and Rrp4 6). The core complex is associated with one or two proteins to form various nuclear or cytoplasmic exosome complexes. The nuclear exosome contains Rrp4 and Rrp4 3, which are involved in 3 'to 5' exoribonuclease activity, and the cytoplasmic exosome contains Ski7. The exosome also contains several cofactors, such as the Paf1 complex, the Trf4 / 5-Mtr4 complex, the SKI complex, and the ENTH complex.",
  "The ECM provides structural support and a three-dimensional framework for cells in tissues. It also provides signals that regulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, differentiation, and other processes. The ECM is a complex mixture of structural and functional molecules, including collagen, laminin, and proteoglycans. Cells interact with the ECM through transmembrane receptors, integrins, which bind to specific ECM ligands. The ECM also interacts with growth factors and cytokines. The ECM and its associated molecules provide spatial and temporal signals that regulate cellular functions. Disruption of the ECM can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and other abnormalities.",
  "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). It is thought that the donor T cells recognize host antigens and injure the tissues and organs of the recipient. GVHD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after BMT. The pathogenesis of GVHD is not well understood. It is believed that the target of the attack is the host's hematopoietic cells. The effector cells are activated T cells. The target cells are hematopoietic cells. The effector cells are activated T cells.",
  "The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family. It is activated by retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A. RAR regulates transcription of genes involved in cell differentiation and apoptosis. The RAR gene is located on chromosome 3p2 5. 1. The RAR gene is transcribed into a single mRNA of approximately 4kb. The RAR protein is composed of three domains: the N-terminal activation domain, the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal ligand binding domain. The ligand binding domain is the site of activation by RA. The RAR gene is transcribed into two isoforms, RAR-alpha and RAR-beta. The RAR-beta isoform is expressed in a tissue specific manner. The ligand binding domain of the RAR protein is the site of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation. Phosphorylation of the RAR-beta protein by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibits the transcriptional activity of the RAR-beta protein. Acetylation of the RAR-beta protein by the transcriptional coactivator CBP / p30 0 blocks the phosphorylation of RAR-beta by PKA. The phosphorylation of RAR-beta by PKA is a reversible modification, since the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors blocks the inhibition of RAR-beta activity by PKA.

  "The NF-kB transcription factor regulates expression of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. The NF-kB family is formed from five subunits, p5 0, p5 2, p6 5, c-Rel, and RelB. The p5 0 and p5 2 subunits are generated by the proteolytic processing of the larger precursors, p1 0 5 and p1 0 0. The precursor proteins contain an N-terminal dimerization domain, a C-terminal DNA binding domain, and a regulatory domain that contains the site of proteolytic processing. The precursor proteins are retained in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory complex that contains an ankyrin repeat region and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat. The inhibitory complex is disrupted by various stimuli, including the phosphorylation of IkB by the IkB kinase (IKK1 and IKK2). The dissociation of the inhibitory complex allows the NF-kB subunits to translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific DNA sequences. The IkB kinase complex is a multi-subunit complex that includes the kinases IKK1 and IKK2, and the regulatory subunit NEMO / IKKgamma. The activation of NF-kB by a variety of stimuli, including TNF-alpha, IL-1, LPS, and T cell receptor activation, requires the phosphorylation of IkB by the IKKs. The IKK complex is also involved in the activation of NF-kB by the Tax protein of HTLV-1, and the Epstein Barr virus BNLF2a protein. The activation of NF-kB by Tax requires the phosphorylation of the IKK complex, but does not require the degradation of IkB. The activation of NF-kB by BNLF2a does not require the phosphorylation of the IKK complex, but does require the phosphorylation of IkB. The activation of NF-kB by Tax also does not require the phosphorylation of IkB, but does require the degradation of IkB.

The activation of NF-kB by BNLF2a does not require the phosphorylation of IkB, but does require the degradation of IkB.",
  "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are a key component of the immune system that kills cells that have been infected with foreign pathogens or that have undergone malignant transformation. CTLs kill cells by two main mechanisms: the first is through the release of granules that contain perforin and granzyme proteins that induce apoptosis in the targeted cell. The second mechanism is through the interaction of Fas ligand on the CTL with Fas on the target cell, activating the apoptotic pathway. The Fas-mediated pathway is used by CTLs to kill cells that are virus infected or that have undergone malignant transformation. The interaction of CTLs with their targets leads to the release of perforin from the CTL into the intercellular space between the two cells. Perforin forms pores in the membrane of the targeted cell, allowing granzymes to enter the cell and activate apoptotic pathways. The interaction of CTLs with their targets also activates the transcription factor NF-AT, which induces the expression of FasL on the target cell, allowing the CTL to kill additional target cells.",
  "The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The innate immune response is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of PRRs that recognize PAMPs and play a key role in the innate immune response. Upon recognition of PAMPs, TLRs activate signaling pathways that lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines and interferons. The downstream signaling pathways activated by TLRs are highly conserved and are similar in all cell types. The first TLR signaling pathway identified was the MyD8 8-dependent pathway. In this pathway, the Toll / IL-1R domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) is recruited to the plasma membrane by the activated TLR. TIRAP then recruits the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) to the receptor. IRAK is then phosphorylated and dissociates from the receptor complex. IRAK then interacts with TRAF6, a ubiquitin ligase that activates the transcription factor NF-kB. TRAF6 also activates the MAP kinase pathway, leading to the activation of AP-1 and the production of inflammatory cytokines. In addition to the MyD8 8-dependent pathway, several other pathways have been identified that activate NF-kB and MAPKs. These pathways are dependent on the specific TLR and the ligand recognized by the receptor. For example, in response to LPS, TLR4 activates the MyD8 8-independent pathway through the adaptor TRIF. TRIF activates the transcription factor IRF-3, leading to the production of interferon.",
  "Cutaneous melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer, accounting for approximately 4% of all cancer deaths. The incidence of melanoma has been on the increase for the past 3 0 years, with a peak incidence in the 54years of age. The prognosis for patients with metastatic melanoma is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 1 5%. The molecular pathogenesis of melanoma is complex and heterogeneous. The majority of melanomas arise from the clonal expansion of melanocytes with the acquisition of one or more mutations. These mutations include those in the genes for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B), and the v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT). Other genes that have been implicated in melanoma pathogenesis include the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), the p53 tumor suppressor, the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and the micro-opthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). The majority of melanomas are sporadic, with an estimated 8 0% of cases arising from the combination of environmental and genetic factors. The role of the environment in melanoma pathogenesis is supported by the fact that the incidence of melanoma is increasing at a greater rate than any other cancer. The role of genetic factors is supported by the fact that familial melanoma accounts for only 1-5% of all melanoma cases. The inheritance of melanoma susceptibility genes is complex, with multiple genes involved and an array of phenotypes.

  "The RAB proteins are a family of small GTPases that regulate intracellular membrane traffic. They are involved in the formation of vesicles from the donor membrane, their movement along the cytoskeleton, and their fusion with the acceptor membrane. The RAB proteins are activated by exchange of bound GDP for GTP and are deactivated by hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. The RAB proteins are regulated by a variety of proteins that stimulate or inhibit the exchange of GDP for GTP. The exchange factors include the GDS family and the SEC7domain family. The GAPs include the RABGAP family and the TBC family. The GAPs inactivate the RAB proteins by stimulating their own GTP hydrolysis. The GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) inhibit the activation of the RAB proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from the RAB proteins. The GDI proteins bind to the RAB proteins in the cytosol and keep them in the inactive, GDP-bound form. The RAB proteins are transported to their target membranes where they are activated by the exchange of GDP for GTP and are inactivated by the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. The target membranes include the plasma membrane, the Golgi complex, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The RAB proteins are inactivated on the target membrane by the action of the RAB-GAPs. The RAB-GAPs include the RN-tre family, the ALX family, and the GAP1 family. The GEFs include the SEC7domain family and the GDS family. The GAPs and GDIs inhibit the activation of the RAB proteins on the target membrane. The target membranes include the plasma membrane, the Golgi complex, and the endoplasmic reticulum.",
  "Blood coagulation is a series of reactions that result in the formation of a clot at the site of a wound or rupture of a blood vessel. The clotting factors in the clotting cascade are serine proteases. The clotting cascade begins with the activation of prothrombin by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin, the major protein in blood clots. The fibrin clot is a mesh-like structure that protects the wound from bleeding. The clotting cascade is completed when activated factor XIII cross-links the fibrin fibers to form a clot. The clotting cascade is regulated by a variety of proteins that either activate or inhibit the cascade. The prothrombin activating complex is a complex of factors V, VII, and X and a phospholipid surface. The prothrombin activating complex is activated by tissue factor, a membrane bound protein that is expressed by damaged cells. The prothrombin activating complex is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a plasma protein that is released into the blood by the damaged cells. The prothrombin activating complex is also inhibited by antithrombin III, another plasma protein that is activated by thrombin. The clotting cascade is also inhibited by heparin, a negatively charged polysaccharide that binds to antithrombin III. Antithrombin III and heparin bind to thrombin and block the interaction of thrombin with other proteins in the clotting cascade. The prothrombin activating complex is also inhibited by heparin cofactor II, a plasma protein that is closely related in sequence to antithrombin III. The prothrombin activating complex is also inhibited by the serpin protease nexin-1 (PN-1). PN-1 is a secreted protein that is activated by thrombin to form an inactive complex with thrombin. The activated form of PN-1 also inhibits factors IXa and Xa in the clotting cascade. The clotting cascade is also inhibited by the fibrinolytic system. The fibrinolytic system is a cascade of enzymes that lyses clots. The initial step in the fibrinolytic system is the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Plasmin then digests fibrin clots and other proteins in clots. The inhibition of the clotting cascade by heparin is due to the binding of heparin to thrombin and the subsequent inhibition of the thrombin by heparin cofactor II.",
  "Interleukin-1 2 (IL-1 2) is a key cytokine in cell-mediated immune response. IL-1 2 induces the differentiation of Th1 cells from naive T cells and stimulates the proliferation and activation of Th1 cells.

  "The MYC transcription factor is a key regulator of cell proliferation and growth. MYC stimulates cell cycle progression by inducing the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, including cyclin D1 and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) Cdk4 and Cdk6. MYC also stimulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), and this contributes to cell growth in addition to cell cycle progression. The induction of rRNA synthesis by MYC contributes to the ability of MYC to stimulate cell growth. MYC also stimulates the expression of genes involved in the synthesis and assembly of ribosomes, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal proteins (rDNAs, RPSs, and RPLs). The coordinate induction of these genes by MYC contributes to the increase in ribosome biogenesis that occurs during cell growth.

  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a key component of the cAMP signaling pathway. It is activated by the binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit of PKA, releasing the catalytic subunit to phosphorylate downstream targets. The catalytic subunit of PKA phosphorylates a variety of substrates including ion channels, transcription factors, and other kinases. The PKA regulatory subunit is encoded by four genes (Prkar1a, Prkar1b, Prkar2a, and Prkar2b) that produce four different isoforms (RIalpha, RIbeta, RII\u03b1, and RIIbeta) that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. cAMP signaling is terminated by the action of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that hydrolyze cAMP to 5 '-AMP. There are 1 1 families of PDEs, each with different regulatory properties and tissue distributions.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. They are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. The three PPAR subtypes (alpha, beta / delta, and gamma) have distinct expression patterns and biological functions. PPAR alpha is a key regulator of lipid metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. It controls the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and transport. PPAR beta / delta is involved in lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

Disruption of this structure can lead to heart failure.",
  "Hypoxia is a common feature of rapidly growing tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. Cells respond to hypoxia by increasing the expression of genes that allow the cell to survive and proliferate in low oxygen. One of the genes induced by hypoxia is that for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a secreted protein that stimulates angiogenesis by inducing the growth of new blood vessels. The induction of VEGF by hypoxia is mediated by a hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the VEGF promoter. Binding of the transcription factor HIF-1 to the HRE is required for VEGF induction by hypoxia. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of two subunits, HIF-1alpha and ARNT. ARNT is a member of the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors that also includes Arnt. HIF-1 is degraded rapidly under normoxic conditions, but is stabilized under hypoxic conditions. The HIF-1alpha subunit is hydroxylated by a family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that include FIH-1. The hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha targets it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. The hydroxylases are oxygen-dependent, suggesting that they are part of the cellular oxygen sensing mechanism. HIF-1 activates the transcription of a number of other genes involved in response to hypoxia, including those for glycolytic enzymes, transferrin, and erythropoietin. ARNT is also required for HIF-1-dependent transcription, but is not itself regulated by hypoxia. HIF-1 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer and ischemic diseases.",
  "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR is a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The binding of ligands to the PPAR-RXR heterodimer induces a conformational change in the receptor, which leads to the release of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators. The coactivators then interact with the basal transcriptional machinery and other transcription factors to regulate gene transcription. The PPAR-RXR heterodimer regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation. PPAR-RXR also regulates cell differentiation and proliferation. The ligands for PPAR include fatty acids and eicosanoids. The expression of PPAR is tissue-specific. PPARa is expressed in skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, heart, liver, and macrophages. PPARb is expressed in brown adipose tissue, heart, liver, and macrophages. PPARg is expressed in adipose tissue and macrophages. The expression of PPARg is induced during adipocyte differentiation.",

  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is composed of an alpha, beta, and gamma chain in a 1: 1: 1 ratio and a delta chain in a 1: 1 ratio. The TCR complex is associated with the CD3 complex, which is composed of the gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu chains. The TCR complex recognizes specific peptide antigens in the context of self-MHC molecules and is required for the activation of T cells. The activation of T cells requires two signals. The first signal is the recognition of antigen by the TCR complex and the second signal is the interaction of costimulatory molecules on the T cell with their ligands on the antigen-presenting cell. The binding of antigen by the TCR complex induces a conformational change in the TCR complex that results in the activation of src family kinases and the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the cytoplasmic domains of the CD3 chains. The phosphorylation of the ITAMs recruits and activates the ZAP7 0 kinase, which in turn activates the downstream signaling pathways. The activation of src kinases and the phosphorylation of the ITAMs are required for the initiation of T cell activation, but do not appear to be sufficient for T cell activation. The activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by the T cell receptor complex is required for the full activation of T cells. The activation of PKA by the TCR complex is not required for the initiation of T cell activation, but is required for the full activation of T cells. The activation of PKA by the TCR complex is not required for the phosphorylation of the TCR complex or the activation of src kinases, but is required for the full activation of src kinases and the downstream signaling pathways.

  "The calcium-activated protease calpain cleaves a variety of cellular proteins, including the cytoskeletal protein spectrin. The cleavage of spectrin by calpain produces a breakdown product that is a marker of calpain activation. The activation of calpain by calcium influx into neurons may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta protein (A beta), which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, may cause calcium influx into neurons, activating calpain and causing the cleavage of cellular proteins. The cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by calpain may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The activation of calpain by amyloid beta protein may also lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, another factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The activation of calpain by amyloid beta protein may also lead to the cleavage of the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase. Calpain activation may also play a role in the toxicity of the prion protein.",
  "Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize extracellular molecules and their ligands by forming vesicles and delivering them to lysosomes for degradation. Endocytosis is also involved in the uptake of nutrients and lipids into cells. There are two major pathways of endocytosis: clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) and clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). CDE is the uptake of ligands bound to their receptors by forming clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). The formation of CCVs requires the assembly of clathrin and adaptor protein 2 (AP2), clathrin adaptors, dynamin, and lipids at the plasma membrane. Some CIE pathways are characterized by the formation of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) -enriched early endosomal compartments (GEECs), caveolae, macropinosomes, and lipid rafts. These pathways do not require clathrin or AP2. They require actin filaments and lipid rafts.",
  "Oxidative stress is a condition in which there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cells to detoxify them. ROS are oxygen-containing molecules with high reactivity. ROS include the superoxide anion (O2 -), hydroxyl radical (OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ROS are produced as by-products of aerobic metabolism and are also produced as part of the immune response. ROS can damage cellular macromolecules such as DNA, lipids, and proteins. The lung is continuously exposed to environmental oxygen and is therefore particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. ROS are produced in the lung by a variety of sources, including the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inflammatory cells, and environmental pollutants. ROS can damage the lung epithelium, causing barrier dysfunction and allowing the passage of inflammatory cells into the lung. ROS can also damage the lung endothelium, causing barrier dysfunction and allowing the passage of inflammatory cells into the lung. ROS can also activate inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells, that produce ROS themselves. ROS can also activate signaling pathways that lead to the production of inflammatory mediators. ROS can activate the transcription factor NF-kB, which regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation. ROS can also activate the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates the expression of antioxidant genes. Nrf2 is activated by oxidative stress and translocates to the nucleus to activate the expression of antioxidant genes. Nrf2 activation may be protective against oxidative stress, but prolonged activation of Nrf2 may lead to the production of excessive ROS and chronic inflammation. ROS can also activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p3 8 pathways. These pathways are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. ROS can also activate the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), which regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis. ROS can also activate the transcription factor NF-kB, which regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis. NF-kB activation can also lead to the production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha and IL-1. ROS can also activate the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), which regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis. ROS can also activate the tyrosine kinase c-Src, which can activate NF-kB and AP-1. ROS can also activate the protease caspase-3, which can activate NF-kB and AP-1. ROS can also activate the kinase p38, which can activate NF-kB and AP-1. ROS can also activate the transcription factor Egr-1, which can regulate the expression of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis. Egr-1 is activated by ROS through the activation of p38 and JNK. Egr-1 can also be activated by growth factors and cytokines, including PDGF, EGF, and TGF-beta. Egr-1 is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis.",

  "The glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type (GRIN1) is a ligand-gated ion channel that is activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The GRIN1 protein is a tetramer consisting of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits (A-D). The NR2 subunits determine the type of ion channel that is formed and the subcellular localization of the receptor. The NR2 subunits are also targets for phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases including PKA, PKC, PKG, and CAMKII. The NR2 subunits are phosphorylated at multiple sites, and the phosphorylation state of the NR2 subunits can alter the properties of the receptor.",
  "The complement system is a group of more than thirty plasma proteins that are part of the immune response to infection. When activated, complement proteins recruit and opsonize bacteria, recruit and activate phagocytes, and directly lyse bacteria. The complement system is activated by three different pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin-mediated pathway, and the alternative pathway. In the classical pathway, antibodies bound to the surface of bacteria activate the complement cascade. In the lectin-mediated pathway, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds to carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria activating the complement cascade. In the alternative pathway, spontaneous activation of complement occurs without the presence of antibodies. In all three pathways, a series of proteolytic reactions lead to the formation of a pore in the bacterial membrane that allows the complement proteins to lyse the bacteria.",
  "The interferon (IFN) family of cytokines includes at least 1 3 distinct members that are involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. The type I IFNs, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, are induced by viral infection and are involved in the early innate response to viral infection. The type II IFN, IFN-gamma, is induced by cytokines such as IL-2 and is involved in the adaptive immune response. The type III IFN, IFN-lambda, is induced by viral infection and is involved in the innate immune response. The IFN-alpha and -beta proteins bind to a cell surface receptor and signal through the JAK / STAT pathway to induce expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The ISGs encode proteins that inhibit viral replication and other processes involved in viral infection. The JAK / STAT pathway is also activated by IFN-gamma, but the JAK kinases involved in this pathway are different from those involved in the IFN-alpha / beta response. The IFN-gamma receptor activates JAK kinases and the STAT transcription factors to induce expression of ISGs. The IFN-alpha / beta receptor also activates the JAK / STAT pathway, but the receptor does not contain JAK kinases. The IFN-alpha / beta receptor also activates the NF-kB transcription factor, and like the JAK / STAT pathway, NF-kB is involved in the immune response to viral infection. The NF-kB pathway is activated by many different stimuli, including cytokines, bacterial products, and viral infection. The IFN-alpha / beta receptor and the JAK / STAT pathway also activate NF-kB, but the role of NF-kB in the IFN response is not clear. The IFN-gamma receptor activates JAK kinases and the STAT transcription factors, but does not activate NF-kB. The IFN-alpha / beta and IFN-gamma receptors activate distinct JAK kinases and STAT transcription factors, but both pathways activate NF-kB. The IFN-alpha / beta and IFN-gamma receptors activate distinct pathways, but both pathways activate NF-kB. The role of NF-kB in the IFN response is not clear. Some studies indicate that NF-kB is involved in the IFN response, while other studies indicate that NF-kB is not involved.",
  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is over-expressed in many different types of cancer. It is a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival and is a target for cancer therapy. The ligand for EGFR is EGF, which is released from cells and binds to EGFR on the cell surface. The binding of EGF to EGFR activates the receptor and causes the receptor to dimerize. The two receptors in the dimer are activated by each other, and each receptor has an active site that phosphorylates other proteins in the cell. One of the targets of EGFR is GRB2, which binds to EGFR and activates the MAP kinase pathway. Another target of EGFR is p21-activated kinase (PAK2). PAK2 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and is activated by EGFR. The activation of PAK2 by EGFR may contribute to the role of EGFR in cell migration and metastasis.",
  "Base excision repair (BER) is the predominant mechanism for the repair of small base lesions such as the alkylated bases and oxidized bases. BER is initiated by a lesion-specific DNA glycosylase that recognizes and excises the base lesion, generating an apurinic / apyrimidinic (AP) site. In the next step, an AP endonuclease (APE1 in human) incises the DNA 5 'to the AP site, generating a single-nucleotide gap with a 5' -deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) residue. In short-patch BER, DNA polymerase (pol) beta removes the dRP and fills in the single nucleotide gap, followed by DNA ligase (Lig) I or Lig III (x-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) and x-ray repair cross-complementing 2 (XRCC2)) -mediated ligation. In long-patch BER, DNA pol delta / epsilon and DNA ligase (Lig) I or Lig III are involved. In single-strand break repair (SSBR), DNA damage is detected and processed by the BER proteins, and the ends are then processed to generate 3 '-OH and 5' -P termini, which are then restored to intact DNA by DNA pol lambda or pol beta.",
  "Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron by increasing the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). ENaC is a member of the ENaC / degenerin family of ion channels. ENaC is expressed in the apical membrane of tight epithelia, such as the distal nephron, lung, and colon. ENaC is formed by three homologous subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) that combine to form a channel with 2alpha1beta1gamma1subunit stoichiometry. ENaC is a limiting step in sodium absorption in tight epithelia and is regulated by a variety of factors, including serum sodium, vasopressin, and aldosterone. Aldosterone acts through the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family, to increase sodium transport. Aldosterone binds to MR in the cytoplasm, causing translocation of the MR-ligand complex to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the MR binds to specific hormone response elements in the regulatory region of ENaC genes, increasing transcription. In addition to transcriptional regulation, aldosterone increases ENaC activity by a rapid, nontranscriptional mechanism. This nontranscriptional mechanism does not require MR or the nucleus. Aldosterone increases the open probability of ENaC channels in the apical membrane by a kinase-dependent mechanism. The kinase SGK1, which is transcriptionally induced by aldosterone, phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, causing Nedd4-2 to bind more tightly to ENaC, resulting in increased ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of ENaC. The nontranscriptional effect of aldosterone does not require SGK1. The rapid effect of aldosterone on ENaC is independent of SGK1 and Nedd4-2.",
  "Protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism of regulating protein activity. Protein kinases are enzymes that transfer a phosphate group from ATP or GTP to specific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in other proteins. The eukaryotic protein kinase PKR is an interferon-induced protein kinase that plays a key role in the anti-viral response. PKR is activated by binding to dsRNA, a by-product of viral replication, and then phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the initiation factor eIF2, inhibiting protein synthesis and viral replication. In addition to its role in the anti-viral response, PKR also plays a role in other cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation. PKR is activated by a variety of cellular stresses, including oxidative stress, heat shock, and amino acid starvation. These stresses activate PKR through a mechanism that does not involve dsRNA binding. Instead, these stresses activate PKR by inducing autophosphorylation of PKR at multiple sites. Once activated, PKR phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eIF2, inhibiting the formation of the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi) and blocking translation.",
  "The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor gene family and is activated by its ligand all-trans retinoic acid (RA). RAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to RA response elements (RAREs) in the promoter region of RA-responsive genes. The transcriptional activity of RAR is regulated by a variety of coactivators and corepressors. The coactivators include CBP / p300, SRC-1, p160, CBP / p160 / RAC3, ACTR, and p / CIP. The corepressors include N-CoR, SMRT, and Alien. The binding of coactivators or corepressors to RAR is ligand-dependent. The coactivators and corepressors bind to the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of RAR through a conserved LxxLL motif. The binding of coactivators to RAR is inhibited by the corepressors in the absence of ligand. Binding of RA to RAR induces a conformational change that dissociates the corepressors and allows the binding of coactivators. The coactivators and corepressors are recruited to the promoter region of the RA-responsive genes through interaction with other transcription factors. The coactivators and corepressors also play a role in the repression of RA-responsive genes by other transcription factors. The binding of corepressors to RAR is inhibited by the transcription factor YY1. The binding of YY1 to RAR is inhibited by the transcription factor NF-Y, which binds to the same site as YY1 in the RA-responsive promoter.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors that are required for the development and survival of specific populations of neurons. NGF binds to TrkA, a member of the trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, to initiate signaling. NGF-TrkA signaling activates several signaling pathways, including the Ras / mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway. The activation of these pathways leads to the induction of neuronal survival and differentiation.",
  "The interferon (IFN) family of cytokines includes several members that are involved in antiviral responses. One of the key actions of type I IFNs is the induction of an antiviral state in cells. The antiviral state induced by type I IFNs is mediated by the transcriptional activation of a set of genes known as the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The products of these genes inhibit viral replication at various steps. One of the key transcription factors involved in the induction of ISGs is the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). In the absence of IFN signaling, IRF-3 is maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. Viral infection or treatment with type I IFNs activates the JAK / STAT signaling pathway, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3. Activated IRF-3 translocates into the nucleus and binds to the ISRE (IFN-stimulated response element) in the promoter of ISGs, leading to their transcriptional activation. Another key transcription factor involved in the induction of ISGs is NF-kB. NF-kB is maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by association with IkB. Viral infection or treatment with type I IFNs activates the IKK kinase complex, which phosphorylates IkB, leading to its degradation and the release of NF-kB. NF-kB then translocates into the nucleus and binds to the NF-kB site in the promoter of ISGs, leading to their transcriptional activation. The IRF-3 and NF-kB transcription factors cooperate to induce the full set of ISGs.",
  "The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that protects the body against invading organisms and aberrant cells. The antigen-specific immune response is initiated when foreign antigen is recognized by T cells. The T cell receptor recognizes antigen in the context of MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The T cell response is regulated by a variety of costimulatory signals provided by other cells in the immune system. The interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells is enhanced by the interaction of the CD40 molecule on the T cell with its ligand, CD137 on the antigen-presenting cell. The CD80 / 1heterodimer on the T cell interacts with the CD8alpha / 1heterodimer on the antigen-presenting cell to provide a costimulatory signal. The interaction of CD40 with CD137 is enhanced by the interaction of CD40 with the B cell costimulatory molecule, CD54. The interaction of CD80 / 1with CD8alpha / 1is enhanced by the interaction of CD8alpha / 1with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). The interaction of CD40 with CD137 is enhanced by the interaction of CD40 with the T cell costimulatory molecule, CD28.",
  "N-linked glycans are attached to asparagine residues of polypeptide chains via an amide bond. N-glycans are classified into four groups: high-mannose, hybrid, complex and neutral glycans. The biosynthesis of N-glycans starts with the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to the lipid precursor, dolichol-P, to form GlcNAc-PP-GlcNAc. This GlcNAc can be transferred several times to a growing polypeptide chain, and the resulting Man5GlcNAc structure is then extended by the addition of mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine to form the core structure, Man3GlcNAc. The addition of glucose residues by the enzyme ER glucosyltransferase (ERGT) represents the first sign of the formation of a complex N-glycan. If the glycan is to be further modified, the mannose residues are extended by the addition of fucoses and N-acetylglucosamine residues by a series of glycosyltransferases. The last three steps in the assembly of a complex N-glycan are catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme complex, the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (ALG).",
  "The chemokine receptors are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that bind to chemoattractant ligands and are expressed on leukocytes. They are involved in leukocyte trafficking and activation. The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are used by HIV-1 as coreceptors along with CD4 for viral entry into cells. The CCR5 receptor is used by macrophage tropic HIV-1 strains, while the CXCR4 receptor is used by T-cell tropic HIV-1 strains. The expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 is regulated by cytokines and other factors. The expression of CCR5 is induced by interferon-gamma and other factors that activate macrophages, while the expression of CXCR4 is induced by cytokines that activate T cells. CCR5 and CXCR4 are also involved in the migration of leukocytes in normal immune responses.",
  "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the key regulator of reproduction in all vertebrates. It is synthesized in the hypothalamus and secreted into the hypophyseal portal circulation, which then travels to the anterior pituitary to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The two forms of GnRH, chicken GnRH I and GnRH II, are found in most vertebrates. In mammals, GnRH I is the major form, whereas in nonmammalian vertebrates, GnRH II is the major form. The GnRH receptor belongs to the 7TM receptor gene family and is coupled to Gq / 1 1, which activates phospholipase C. The resulting second messengers are IP3 and DAG, which mobilize intracellular calcium, and activate protein kinase C. These second messengers are essential for GnRH receptor signaling. The activation of the MAPK cascade by the receptor also requires the activation of PKC. The activation of the PKC pathway is calcium dependent, whereas the activation of the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway is calcium independent. The GnRH receptor is also coupled to the Gs / AC / cAMP pathway, which is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of the gonadotropins. The activation of the Gs / AC / cAMP pathway is also involved in the regulation of the synthesis of the gonadotropins.",
  "The main transduction pathway for olfaction is through activation of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) cascade in the cilia of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). The main excitatory stimulus is binding of odorants to a receptor coupled to a Gs protein. Activation of the Gs protein stimulates adenylyl cyclase (AC), which converts ATP to cAMP. The elevated intracellular cAMP activates a cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, leading to influx of Na + and Ca + +, and a small depolarization. The depolarization opens a transduction channel, which is permeable to Na +, Ca + +, and less permeable to K +. The increase in intracellular Ca + + activates a Cl \u2212 channel, increasing the Cl \u2212 concentration in the cilia, which further depolarizes the cell. The Ca + + also activates a Ca + + -activated Cl \u2212 channel, which may further depolarize the cell. The Ca + + also activates a Ca + + -calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaM kinase), which may modulate the activity of other proteins. The activation of the kinase cascade may also modulate the activity of the CNG channel.",
  "Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors that support the survival and differentiation of specific neuronal populations. The neurotrophins include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). Neurotrophin binding to Trk tyrosine kinase receptors activates several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The PI3K pathway is activated by binding of neurotrophins to Trk receptors, and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt. The activation of Akt by neurotrophins leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. The phosphorylation of Bad by Akt leads to the formation of a complex between Bad and the survival factor Bcl-xL, preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and blocking apoptosis. The activation of the MAPK pathway by Trk receptors leads to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, which can lead to the activation of genes involved in neuronal survival.",
  "Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that consist of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences and associated proteins. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that adds de novo telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes using an RNA template. Telomerase activity is low or undetectable in most human somatic cells, but is activated in germ cells and in most cancer cells. Telomerase activity is repressed in most human somatic cells, and this repression is one mechanism by which cells achieve the limited proliferative capacity that characterizes normal human cells in culture. Telomerase activity is repressed in most human cells in culture due to the progressive shortening of telomeres with each round of cell division. When telomeres become critically short, a checkpoint in the cell cycle is activated that leads to cell death by apoptosis or a senescence program. Telomerase activity is repressed in most human cells in culture due to the progressive shortening of telomeres with each round of cell division. When telomeres become critically short, a checkpoint in the cell cycle is activated that leads to cell death by apoptosis or a senescence program. Telomerase activity is repressed in most human cells in culture due to the progressive shortening of telomeres with each round of cell division. Telomerase activity is activated in most human cancer cells, and this activation is one mechanism by which cancer cells achieve the unlimited proliferative capacity that characterizes cancer cells. Telomerase activity is repressed in most human cells in culture due to the progressive shortening of telomeres with each round of cell division.

  "The peptide hormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that is also mitogenic and pro-fibrotic. ET-1 is secreted by endothelial cells and binds to two G-protein coupled receptors, ETAR and ETBR, expressed in many cell types. Binding of ET-1 to ETAR stimulates phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol to generate inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol trisphosphate stimulates release of calcium from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (PKC). PKC activation also stimulates the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway, leading to activation of the transcription factor AP-1. PKC also activates the Map kinase pathway, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. Activation of AP-1 and NF-kB stimulates transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and inflammation. Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) stimulates cell proliferation through multiple pathways, including activation of ras and the Map kinase pathway. ET-1 also stimulates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) through activation of the EGFR. ET-1 also stimulates proliferation of fibroblasts and epithelial cells through activation of the EGFR. ET-1 also stimulates production of extracellular matrix proteins by fibroblasts and other cell types. The proliferative and pro-fibrotic actions of ET-1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal diseases. ET receptor antagonists are being developed as potential therapeutic agents.",
  "Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone that regulates growth and metabolism. The GH receptor (GHR) is a member of the cytokine receptor gene family. Binding of GH to the GHR activates the JAK / STAT pathway, the MAPK pathway, and the PI3 kinase pathway. These pathways in turn regulate gene expression.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly coordinated sequence of events that includes DNA replication and cell division. The G1 to S phase transition is a key regulatory checkpoint in the cell cycle. This transition is regulated by the concerted action of the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and their associated regulatory subunits, the cyclins. The activity of the cdks is regulated by the association of the cyclins with the cdk inhibitors. The cdk-cyclin complexes phosphorylate specific proteins that regulate the G1 to S phase transition. The phosphorylation of the Rb protein by the cdk4-cyclin D and cdk6-cyclin D complexes releases the inhibition of the E2F transcription factors that are required for progression into S phase. The cdk2-cyclin E complex also phosphorylates the Rb protein, and the phosphorylation of the histone H1 protein by the cdk2-cyclin A complex completes the release of the E2F transcriptional activation. The cyclin-cdk inhibitors, such as p16INK4a, p15Ink4b, and p27Kip1, inhibit the phosphorylation of the cdk substrates and act as tumor suppressors. The p16INK4a-cdk4-p60Rb pathway is frequently disrupted in human cancer. The p15Ink4b-p90Rsk pathway is also frequently disrupted in cancer. The p27Kip1 protein inhibits the formation of the cdk2-cyclin E and cdk2-cyclin A complexes and acts as a tumor suppressor. The TGF-beta signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle. Binding of TGF-beta to its receptor activates the receptor-associated Smad proteins, p23 and p37. The activated Smads translocate to the nucleus and interact with other transcription factors to regulate the expression of cell cycle inhibitors, such as p15Ink4b and p27Kip1.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly regulated process that ensures that DNA is replicated only once per cell cycle and that the cell cycle is separated into four phases: G1, S, G2 and M. The G1 phase is the period of preparation for DNA replication and the restriction point is the point at which the cell no longer responds to growth factors. The restriction point is just one point in the cell cycle. When the cell cycle is paused at the restriction point, the cell is no longer able to enter S phase and DNA replication does not occur. The restriction point is regulated by the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDKs are a family of proteins that are activated by the binding of a cyclin subunit and are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. The CDKs are activated by the phosphorylation of threonine 1 6 1 by the CDK activating kinase (CAK). The CDKs are negatively regulated by the CDK inhibitors (CDKIs). The CDKIs are a family of proteins that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and are classified into two groups: the INK4 inhibitors (p1 5, p1 6, p1 8 and p1 9) and the KIP / Cip inhibitors (p2 1, p2 7 and p5 7). The INK4 inhibitors specifically inhibit the CDK4 and CDK6 kinases that phosphorylate the Rb protein to release the transcription factor E2F-1. E2F-1 is involved in the transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and progression through the cell cycle. The KIP / Cip inhibitors inhibit the activity of CDK2 and CDK1, which are involved in the transition from G1 to S phase. The CDKIs are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The phosphorylation of the CDKIs by the CDKs targets them for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The ubiquitination of the CDKIs is carried out by an SCF complex that includes the proteins Cul1, Skp1, Roc1 and CD34. The ubiquitination of the CDKIs by the SCF complex targets them for degradation by the 2 6S proteasome. The degradation of the CDKIs by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway allows the CDKs to phosphorylate the Rb protein and release the transcription factor E2F-1. E2F-1 then activates the transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and progression through the cell cycle. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway also plays a role in the DNA damage checkpoint. The phosphorylation of the CDKI p21 by the checkpoint kinase ATM stabilizes p21 and prevents the activation of CDKs and the cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage.",
  "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin that promotes the survival and differentiation of specific neuronal populations. NGF binds to TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, to initiate signaling. NGF binding to TrkA activates Ras / Map kinase signaling and also phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1). The Map kinase pathway includes activation of p38 and p21, which regulate transcription. The p38 pathway includes induction of c-fos and Egr-1, and the p21 pathway includes induction of Egr-1. The Map kinase pathway also includes activation of the transcription factor SRF. NGF also activates the AKT pathway, which regulates the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1. NGF also activates the small G protein Rac1, which regulates the JNK pathway. NGF also activates PI3 kinase, which activates p44 / 42 and regulates other pathways.",
  "The sense of taste is mediated by specialized receptors located in the taste bud that respond to a variety of taste stimuli. Taste receptors are found on both the apical and basolateral membranes of taste cells. On the apical surface of taste cells, there are ion channels that transduce taste stimuli into electrical signals. These include amiloride-sensitive Na + channels for salt, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) for sour, and the two pore-domain K + channels (Kcn2s) for bitter and sweet. On the basolateral membrane, taste cells are stimulated by taste-detecting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These GPCRs include the heterodimer taste 1 receptor (T1R) for sweet and umami, and the heterodimer taste 2 receptor (T2R) for bitter and sweet. In addition to these GPCRs, taste cells express a variety of taste signal transduction elements including PLCbeta2, which produces IP3 and diacylglycerol, which in turn activate a transient increase in intracellular Ca2 +. This Ca2 + signal activates the TRPM5 channel, which is required for the transduction of all taste qualities.",
  "Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted protein that plays a key role in the development of many tissues. In the developing cerebellum, Shh secreted by the Purkinje cells acts on the granule cell precursors (GCPs) in the external granule cell layer (EGL) to stimulate their proliferation. The proliferating GCPs then migrate into the internal granule cell layer (IGL) and differentiate. Shh signaling is also involved in the proliferation of other cell types, including neural precursors in the developing retina and the developing brain. The Shh receptor is a transmembrane protein called Patched (Ptc). In the absence of Shh, Ptc inhibits the activity of Smoothened (Smo), a G-protein coupled receptor. Smo then activates several signaling pathways, including the Gli family of transcription factors. The role of Shh signaling in cancer has been the focus of considerable recent research. Mutations in the Shh receptor Ptc or in the Shh signaling pathway components Smo or Sufu have been found in a large fraction of human cancers, including basal cell carcinomas, meduloblastoma, and some forms of pancreatic cancer. The discovery that Shh signaling is involved in cancer has led to the development of drugs that block the Shh pathway and are being tested as anti-cancer agents.",
  "The T-cell receptor (TCR) complex is a multimeric complex that is expressed on the surface of all T cells and is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens in the form of peptides bound to MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The TCR complex is composed of five subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon. The CD3 complex is composed of three heterodimers, gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta. The TCR complex is responsible for the recognition of specific antigens in the form of peptides bound to MHC molecules, and the activation of T cells. The interaction of the TCR with the MHC / peptide complex is the key event in the activation of T cells. The interaction of the T-cell receptor with MHC / peptide is a two-step process. The first step is the interaction of the T-cell receptor with MHC / peptide. The T-cell receptor binds to the MHC / peptide complex in a peptide-specific manner, but the affinity of the interaction is low. The second step is the interaction of the T-cell receptor with the CD4 or CD8 coreceptor. The coreceptor increases the affinity of the interaction of the T-cell receptor with MHC / peptide and increases the specificity of the interaction. The coreceptor is responsible for increasing the sensitivity of T cells and is also involved in the regulation of T-cell activation. The coreceptor is not required for T-cell activation, but increases the sensitivity of T-cell activation. The coreceptor is not required for the binding of the T-cell receptor to MHC / peptide, but is required for the activation of T cells by T cells. The coreceptor is required for the interaction of the T-cell receptor with the tyrosine kinase Lck. Lck is a member of the src family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in signal transduction pathways. Lck phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 subunits of the T-cell receptor complex. The phosphorylation of the ITAMs increases the affinity of the T-cell receptor for the tyrosine kinase Zap-7 0, which is associated with the T-cell receptor complex. Lck also phosphorylates the coreceptor CD8beta, which is required for the coreceptor activity. The activation of Lck and Zap-7 0 by the coreceptor increases the number of T-cell receptors that bind MHC / peptide and increases the sensitivity of T cells to antigen. The interaction of the T-cell receptor with the coreceptor CD8beta also regulates the specificity of T-cell activation. T cells that do not express CD8beta are anergic to antigen and do not respond to antigen presented by MHC-I molecules.

  "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The etiology of PD is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1, parkin, PINK1, DJ1, and LRRK2 have been identified as causative factors for familial PD. Environmental toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and rotenone have been shown to induce PD-like symptoms by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, leading to oxidative stress and dopaminergic neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction may also be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial complex I deficiency is found in the substantia nigra of patients with PD. Moreover, it has been suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction may be caused by oxidative stress, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the depletion of ATP. These events may trigger the abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein, which is a hallmark of PD.",
  "Inflammation is a response to injury or infection that can result in the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. These mediators cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation. The inflammatory response is initiated by the interaction of the endothelium with inflammatory mediators such as histamine and serotonin. Histamine causes increased vascular permeability and activation of leukocytes. Serotonin is a potent vasoconstrictor that also activates leukocytes. Histamine and serotonin are released from activated mast cells at the site of inflammation. Activated mast cells also release the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. TNF causes increased vascular permeability and activation of leukocytes. TNF also activates endothelial cells, causing expression of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin that mediate the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation. TNF also activates the expression of IL-6, a cytokine that can activate the acute phase response in the liver and cause fever. Histamine and serotonin also activate endothelial cells, causing increased expression of the chemokine IL-8. IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and T cells and can also activate leukocytes. Histamine and serotonin also activate endothelial cells to express tissue factor, a cofactor for the activation of the clotting cascade. Tissue factor expression by endothelial cells is also activated by IL-1 and TNF. Tissue factor expression by endothelial cells is a key step in the formation of the blood clots that cause thrombosis. The activation of tissue factor by histamine and serotonin may also contribute to the localized inflammation that occurs in allergic reactions. The recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation is also mediated by adhesion molecules on the surface of the endothelium. Histamine and serotonin activate endothelial cells to express the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 bind to the integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1 on leukocytes, causing the activation of leukocytes and their recruitment to the site of inflammation. The interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium is also enhanced by the expression of P-selectin on the endothelium by histamine and serotonin. P-selectin binds to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes, increasing the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium. Histamine and serotonin also activate the expression of the chemokine IL-8 by endothelial cells. IL-8 activates neutrophils and T cells and also activates the expression of tissue factor by endothelial cells. The activation of tissue factor expression by histamine and serotonin may also contribute to the localized inflammation that occurs in allergic reactions. The recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation is also mediated by chemokines. Histamine and serotonin also activate the expression of the chemokine IL-8 by endothelial cells. IL-8 activates neutrophils and T cells and also activates the expression of tissue factor by endothelial cells.

The activation of the coagulation cascade by histamine and serotonin may also contribute to the localized inflammation that occurs in allergic reactions.",
  "Macrophages are cells of the immune system that respond to infection by ingesting and destroying bacteria and other pathogens. Macrophages produce a variety of factors that stimulate the immune system to respond to infection. One of the first steps in the immune response is the production of cytokines by macrophages in response to infection. Cytokines produced by macrophages include IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and colony stimulating factors (CSF). IL-1 is a cytokine that stimulates fever, inflammation, and other responses to infection. IL-6 is a cytokine that stimulates the immune response and is involved in the acute phase response to infection. TNF is a cytokine that causes inflammation and can cause septic shock. CSF is a group of cytokines that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of cells in the immune system. IL-3 stimulates the growth of eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells, and IL-5 stimulates the differentiation of eosinophils and basophils. IL-4 is a cytokine that stimulates the differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing plasma cells and stimulates the proliferation of B cells. IL-10 is a cytokine that inhibits the production of other cytokines by macrophages and other cells in response to infection. IL-15 is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils and other cells. The interferons are a group of cytokines that inhibit the growth of cells in response to infection. The interferons are induced by infection and other factors and stimulate cells to produce a variety of factors that help to fight infection. The major cell types that produce the interferons are cells in the immune system, including macrophages. The interferons include IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, and IFN-omega. Other cytokines produced by macrophages include IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-15. IL-10 is a cytokine that inhibits the production of other cytokines by macrophages and other cells in response to infection.",
  "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is a major signaling pathway that regulates cellular responses to growth factors and cytokines. The ERK pathway is also activated by oncogenic forms of Ras and is required for Ras-mediated cellular transformation. The ERK pathway is initiated by the binding of growth factors to their receptors, which leads to the activation of Ras. Activated Ras stimulates the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, which includes Raf, MEK, and ERK. Activated ERK translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates transcription factors such as Elk-1, causing induction of genes such as c-fos. The Crk adaptor protein is involved in the activation of the ERK pathway downstream of the Abl tyrosine kinase and the PDGFbeta receptor. Crk is a downstream target of the PDGFbeta receptor and binds to the tyrosine kinase c-Abl. Crk also binds to C3G, a Rap1 exchange factor, and stimulates Rap1, which activates B-Raf, a MEK kinase. The CrkL adaptor protein also binds to Abl and stimulates the ERK pathway. The CrkL-Abl complex also stimulates the Stat pathway, which also contributes to cellular transformation. The CrkL-Abl complex also stimulates the JNK pathway, which also contributes to cellular transformation. The CrkL-mediated activation of the JNK pathway is independent of the ERK pathway and does not require the kinase activity of Abl. The CrkL-Abl complex also stimulates the Stat pathway, which contributes to cellular transformation. The CrkL-Abl complex also stimulates the PI 3-kinase pathway, which contributes to cellular transformation.",

  "The meiotic cell cycle in oocytes is an example of the cell cycle, which is the process by which a cell prepares for and proceeds through the division of its chromosomes to two daughter cells. The maturation of oocytes is induced by the hormone, progesterone, and is followed by the extrusion of the first polar body. The maturation of Xenopus oocytes is a useful model system for the study of cell cycle control and meiosis. The maturation of Xenopus oocytes is accompanied by the activation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF), a heterodimer of a 3 4 kDa kinase subunit, p34cdc2 and a 14 kDa regulatory subunit, p25MAP. The activation of MPF is a key event in the initiation of oocyte maturation. The activation of MPF is a multi-step process. The first step is the synthesis of Mos, a protein kinase that activates the MAP kinase pathway. The second step is the synthesis of cyclins, which activate the maturation-promoting factor (MPF). The third step is the inactivation of Myt1 and of p27Mei2, two dual-specificity protein phosphatases that inhibit MPF. The final step is the inactivation of the CSF (cytostatic factor), a factor that prevents the metaphase II (MII) arrest of the eggs by inhibiting the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cyclin B by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). The CSF activity is regulated by the phosphorylation state of the MAP kinase kinase kinase, mos. The CSF activity is also regulated by the cAMP level.",
  "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that is produced by activated Th2 cells and that plays a key role in the differentiation of Th2 cells. IL-4 acts on a variety of cells, including B cells, mast cells, and macrophages, and can stimulate the differentiation of Th2 cells. IL-4 also acts on cells of the brain to alter the response to stress. The IL-4 receptor is a heterodimer, with a chain that is also part of the IL-1 2 receptor. IL-4 binds first to the IL-4 receptor alpha chain, which is a component of the IL-1 2 receptor. The IL-4 receptor beta chain is a member of the IL-2 receptor family. IL-4 does not bind to the IL-2 receptor beta chain alone, but requires the IL-2 receptor beta chain in addition to the IL-4 receptor alpha chain to form a functional IL-4 receptor. IL-4 does not bind to the IL-2 receptor alpha chain alone, but requires the IL-2 receptor beta chain to form a functional IL-2 receptor. IL-4 does not bind to the IL-1 0 receptor.",
  "The formation of heme, a cofactor in many essential cellular processes, is a highly complex process. In erythroid cells, the first step in heme biosynthesis is the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to form hydroxymethylbilane. This reaction is catalyzed by hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase). Hydroxymethylbilane is converted to porphobilinogen by uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS). The condensation of four porphobilinogen molecules with ferrous iron and succinyl-CoA to form hydroxymethylbilane is catalyzed by porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). The heme biosynthetic pathway is then completed by the insertion of ferrous iron and ligation of four hemes to the porphobilinogen to yield heme. The first step in heme biosynthesis is the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to form hydroxymethylbilane. HMB-synthase catalyzes this reaction in all organisms that make heme. HMB-synthase is a member of the highly conserved isochorismatase family. HMB-synthase is a homodimer with each subunit containing a covalently bound pyridoxal phosphate cofactor. HMB-synthase is feedback inhibited by heme. HMB-synthase is a potential drug target for the treatment of malaria.",
  "Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. It has been shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6. The anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 are mediated through the activation of a transcription factor, Stat6. In the absence of IL-10, Stat6 is not activated and pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced. The anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 are important in the regulation of the inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 are also important in the regulation of autoimmune disorders such as arthritis. The anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 are also important in the regulation of tumor growth. The anti-tumor properties of IL-10 are mediated through the activation of Stat1 and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. The anti-tumor properties of IL-10 are also important in the regulation of transplant rejection. The anti-rejection properties of IL-10 are mediated through the inhibition of Th1 cell differentiation and the inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inhibition of Th1 cell differentiation is mediated through the inhibition of IL-12 production by IL-10. The inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production is mediated through the inhibition of NF-kB activation by IL-10. The inhibition of NF-kB activation by IL-10 is also important in the inhibition of tumor growth.",
  "The scanning model of translation initiation states that 4 0S ribosomal subunit binds to the 5 'end of mRNA and scans the mRNA until it encounters the initiation triplet. The scanning ribosome then binds to the initiator tRNA and the other factors to form the 4 8S initiation complex. The binding of 60S subunit to the 4 8S complex leads to joining of the ribosomal subunits and elongation of the peptide chain.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) is a cell surface receptor that recognizes specific peptide antigens bound to MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Interaction of the TCR with antigen-presenting cells activates a signaling pathway that leads to T cell proliferation and differentiation. The Rho family of small GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc4 2, are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and other cellular functions. The Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are upstream activators of Rho GTPases. The Dbl family member Lbc is a GEF for RhoA, and also has a kinase domain that is specific for p190RhoGAP. The p190RhoGAP protein is a negative regulator of RhoA signaling. The Lbc Dbl homology (DH) domain catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP, activating the Rho protein. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain regulates the DH domain. The kinase domain is not required for GEF activity, but is required for p190RhoGAP phosphorylation and activation. The Dbl family member Lbc is involved in signaling by the TCR. Interaction of the TCR with antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell activates the tyrosine kinase Lck, which phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic domain of the TCR-associated CD3 proteins. The phosphorylated ITAMs recruit and activate the tyrosine kinase Zap-7 0. Lck and Zap-7 0 phosphorylate each other and other proteins, including the adaptors LAT and SLP-7 6. The Tec family kinases Itk and Rlk are also recruited to the LAT-SLP-7 6 complex by binding to SLP-7 6. The Tec kinases phosphorylate SLP-7 6, and the Tec kinases and p190RhoGAP phosphorylate each other. The activated Rho GTPases regulate downstream effectors, including the kinases MRCK and PKN, and the formins Dia1 and FMNL. Downstream of Rho, the kinases ROCK and MRCK regulate the actin cytoskeleton and other cellular functions. The formins regulate actin polymerization and other cellular functions.

  "The T cell receptor complex is composed of at least six different polypeptides (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta) and is associated with the CD3 complex in a 1: 1ratio. The CD3 complex is composed of gamma, delta, epsilon, and either CD24 (for CD24) or CD12 (for the rest of the complex). The T cell receptor complex is responsible for the recognition of specific antigen in the context of MHC proteins by T cells. The binding of antigen to the T cell receptor leads to T cell activation and proliferation. The CD28 protein is a co-stimulatory molecule that is induced by T cell receptor activation and is required for full T cell activation. The CD28 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin gene family and is expressed on the surface of T cells only after T cell activation. CD28 binds to the tyrosine kinase Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) and is required for the activation of T cells by CD28. The T cell receptor is a multimeric complex with each receptor complex containing one alpha and one beta chain that bind the specific antigen and one gamma, delta, epsilon, or zeta chain that is responsible for the association of the complex with the CD3 complex. The zeta chain is responsible for the association of the T cell receptor with the CD3 complex and is responsible for the association of the T cell receptor with Lck.

The activation of Lck by CD28 leads to the phosphorylation of the T cell receptor and other T cell signaling molecules and the full T cell activation.",
  "Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. The EPO receptor is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain. The receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor family that includes the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, and LIF. Binding of EPO to its receptor activates JAK kinases that phosphorylate the receptor and downstream signaling molecules. One of the downstream signaling molecules activated by EPO is the transcription factor NF-kB. Activation of NF-kB by EPO may play a role in the neuroprotective effects of EPO. The activation of NF-kB by EPO may also play a role in the anti-inflammatory effects of EPO. Another downstream target of EPO is the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is a transcription factor that is activated by hypoxia and plays a key role in the response of cells to hypoxia. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of two subunits, HIF-1alpha and ARNT. The HIF-1alpha subunit is degraded under normoxic conditions by the proteasome, but is stabilized under hypoxic conditions. The stabilization of HIF-1 by hypoxia leads to the activation of genes involved in oxygen delivery and erythropoiesis. EPO activates HIF-1 through a pathway that does not involve hypoxia or reactive oxygen species. The activation of HIF-1 by EPO may play a role in the neuroprotective effects of EPO.",
  "The adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium is a key event in the inflammatory response. The interaction of leukocytes with the vascular endothelium is mediated by a family of adhesion molecules on the leukocyte and endothelial cell surface. The interaction of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) with ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) on the endothelium is a key step in the inflammatory response. ICAM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells. LFA-1 is a member of the integrin family of adhesion molecules and is expressed on the surface of leukocytes. The interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 is required for the extravasation of leukocytes from the blood into tissues during inflammation. The interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 is regulated by the leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (macrophage adhesion protein 1). Mac-1 is also an adhesion molecule, but it does not bind to ICAM-1.

  "The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells are the key players in innate immunity. Macrophages phagocytose and kill bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and are responsible for the recruitment of other immune cells to the site of infection. Neutrophils release reactive oxygen species and proteases to kill bacteria and fungi. NK cells are cytotoxic cells that kill infected cells and secrete cytokines to stimulate the immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved microbial structures and activate innate immunity. Macrophages and neutrophils express several TLRs that recognize bacterial cell wall components. NK cells express TLR2 and TLR4 and respond to bacterial components by secreting cytokines that stimulate the immune system. Neutrophils and macrophages also express the costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 that stimulate T cell activation. T cells respond to antigen presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are the most potent APCs and are required for the activation of T cells. Macrophages and DCs phagocytose and present antigen to T cells. Macrophages and DCs also secrete cytokines that stimulate the immune response. Macrophages and DCs secrete IL-12 that stimulates T cell activation and polarization to a Th1 phenotype. Macrophages and DCs also secrete IL-15 that stimulates NK cell activation and proliferation. Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are a subset of T cells that respond to specific antigen and cause cell death of infected cells. The Th1 phenotype is characterized by the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, while the Th2 phenotype is characterized by the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. Macrophages and DCs also secrete IL-10, a cytokine that inhibits the Th1 response. The balance of Th1 and Th2 cells determines the type of immune response and the type of inflammatory response.",
  "The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) family is a group of enzymes that catalyze the release of fatty acids from membrane phospholipids. The release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids, a family of biologically active lipids that include prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes. The PLA2 superfamily is classified into four main groups: group I (Ca (2 +) -independent), group II (secreted), group III (cytosolic), and group IV (GV, adipose). The group IV enzymes are further subdivided into group IVA (Ca (2 +) -dependent) and group IVB (Ca (2 +) -independent). The group IVA enzymes are further subdivided into groups IVA1 (platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase), group IVA2 (cytosolic phospholipase A2), and group IVB (lysosomal).

  "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is activated by peptide growth factors including EGF. The EGFR is widely expressed in many tissues and is involved in a variety of cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. The EGFR is a member of a family of closely related receptors that also includes the human platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2). The EGFR is over-expressed in a number of human cancers and is a target for cancer therapy. The EGFR is a heterodimer with another member of the EGFR family, most commonly with ERBB2. The binding of growth factor to the EGFR induces receptor dimerization and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. The activated receptor phosphorylates itself as well as other cellular proteins on tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues act as binding sites for proteins containing src homology 2 (SH2) domains. These proteins include the GRB2 adaptor protein that in turn binds to Sos-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. The activation of Ras induces a series of downstream signaling events including the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the PI3 kinase pathway. Other downstream signaling pathways include the JAK / STAT pathway and the p21-activated kinase (PAK) pathway.",
  "Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion in the presence of insulin resistance. The disease is associated with insulin resistance, which is caused by obesity and / or a genetic predisposition. The insulin resistance leads to a compensatory increase in insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells, but the insulin response is inadequate to compensate for the insulin resistance. The inability of beta-cells to secrete insulin results in hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its etiology. The genetic component is estimated to account for 4 0-6 0% of the heritability of type 2 diabetes. The genetic defects that lead to type 2 diabetes affect beta-cell function and / or insulin action. The genetic defects may be in genes that regulate beta-cell function (e.g., transcription factors that regulate the expression of insulin and other beta-cell-specific genes) or genes that regulate insulin action (e.g., the insulin receptor and its signaling molecules).",
  "Leukocyte migration is a key process in inflammation and host defense. Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium is a prerequisite for their subsequent diapedesis. Leukocyte adhesion is mediated by a family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including selectins, integrins, and cadherins. Leukocyte integrins bind to their ligands on the endothelium at sites of intercellular gaps. The interaction of P-, E-, and L-selectins with their ligands on the endothelium initiates a cascade of events that culminates in the firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. This is followed by the activation of leukocyte integrins, which strengthen the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. The activation of leukocyte integrins also triggers the opening of endothelial intercellular junctions, allowing leukocytes to migrate across the endothelium. The opening of endothelial junctions is mediated by a family of molecules collectively known as occludins and junction adhesion molecules (JAMs). Once leukocytes have transmigrated, they are retained in the vascular space by interactions with the junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) 1and 2.",
  "The cell cycle is a sequence of events that lead from a resting state (Go) to DNA replication (S phase), followed by two (M and G1), and then a return to Go. The cell cycle is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), a family of serine / threonine kinases that include CDK1 (also known as CDC2), CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, and CDK6. The CDKs are activated by binding to cyclins, which are in turn regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). The CDKIs include p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, p19ARF, and p21Cip1 / Waf1. The CDKs and CDKIs form a regulatory network that monitors the integrity of the genome and controls the progression through the cell cycle. Many of the genes that are mutated in cancer are components of the cell cycle control machinery. For example, the CDKIs are tumor suppressors that prevent inappropriate cell cycle progression, and the CDKs are positive regulators that promote cell cycle progression. Mutations in the CDKI genes or in CDKs that lead to their constitutive activation are associated with cancer.",
  "The chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) is a G-protein coupled receptor that binds the chemokine ligand, eotaxin. Eotaxin is a chemokine that attracts eosinophils and basophils to sites of inflammation. The CCR3 receptor is expressed on a variety of cells including eosinophils, Th2 lymphocytes, basophils, and Th2-like cells. The activation of eosinophils by eotaxin leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of additional eosinophils to the site of inflammation. The activation of Th2 cells by eotaxin also leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of eosinophils. The activation of basophils by eotaxin also leads to the release of inflammatory mediators. The activation of Th2 cells by eotaxin leads to the release of Th2 cytokines that recruit additional eosinophils and basophils to the site of inflammation. The activation of Th2 cells also leads to the production of IgE antibodies that bind to allergens and activate an allergic response. The activation of CCR3 by eotaxin leads to the activation of the G-protein, Gq, and the subsequent activation of phospholipase C beta 1. The activation of phospholipase C leads to the production of IP3 and diacylglycerol, which leads to the release of intracellular calcium and the activation of protein kinase C. The activation of CCR3 also leads to the activation of the small G-protein Rho. The activation of Rho leads to the formation of stress fibers and the activation of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK). The activation of ROCK leads to the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and the formation of stress fibers. The activation of ROCK also leads to the phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, which inhibits the activity of myosin phosphatase. The activation of CCR3 also leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The activation of MAPK pathways leads to the activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression of inflammatory genes.",
  "The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is triggered by the recognition of conserved microbial structures by a set of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of membrane-bound PRRs that recognize conserved microbial components and activate signaling pathways that induce innate immune responses. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and signals through the adaptor protein MyD8 8 to activate NF-kB and MAPK pathways, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR4 also signals through a MyD8 8-independent pathway that leads to the activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and the induction of interferon beta. The complement system is a plasma protein cascade that lyses bacteria and engulfs foreign cells. The complement system is activated by three distinct pathways, the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the mannose-associated pathway. The C1 complex, which consists of a tetramer of C1q and two molecules of C1r and C1s, is the recognition molecule in the classical pathway. The C1 complex binds to antigen-antibody complexes on the surface of cells in the classical pathway. The alternative pathway is activated by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 and is amplified by the mannose-associated pathway. The alternative pathway is also amplified by the formation of C3 convertases. The third complement pathway is independent of these three activation mechanisms. Neutrophils and macrophages are the effector cells of innate immunity. They phagocytose and kill bacteria through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Macrophages also induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.",
  "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells. The IL-2 receptor is composed of three chains, alpha, beta and gamma. The alpha chain is specific for IL-2 and is responsible for ligand binding. The beta chain is shared with IL-4 and IL-7 and the gamma chain is shared with the receptors for IL-4 and IL-9. The beta chain is also shared with the IL-1 5 receptor. The gamma chain is also shared with the receptors for IL-2 1 and IL-2. The activation of T cells by antigen binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) is accompanied by the induction of IL-2 production. IL-2 acts on T cells that have been activated by antigen-MHC complexes on an antigen-presenting cell. IL-2 acts on T cells through the IL-2 receptor, which is expressed at low levels on the surface of unstimulated T cells. Binding of IL-2 to the IL-2 receptor leads to activation of the JAK / STAT signaling pathway and the MAPK pathway. JAK kinases are activated by phosphorylation by the IL-2 receptor and phosphorylate STAT transcription factors that translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of genes involved in T cell growth and differentiation. The MAPK pathway is also activated by IL-2 and leads to activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-AT that regulate transcription of T cell growth and differentiation genes. The activation of T cells by IL-2 is accompanied by the induction of apoptosis in a small fraction of the cells. The mechanism of apoptosis induction by IL-2 is not yet clear. One mechanism of apoptosis induction by growth factors is through the induction of expression of the protein BIM, a member of the BCL-2 family that induces apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-xL. BIM is induced by IL-2 in activated T cells and may play a role in apoptosis induction by IL-2.",
  "Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine that regulates red blood cell production. Epo binds to its receptor on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells and stimulates proliferation and differentiation. The EpoR is a member of the cytokine receptor gene family and is coupled to several different signaling pathways. The JAK / STAT pathway is one of the pathways activated by the EpoR. The JAK kinases are protein tyrosine kinases that are activated by cytokine receptors and that phosphorylate and activate STAT transcription factors. The JAK kinases are also activated by the EpoR and are required for activation of the STAT pathway by Epo. The Ras / Map kinase pathway is another pathway activated by cytokine receptors and can be activated by JAK kinases. The Map kinase pathway is activated by Epo and is required for Epo to stimulate proliferation of erythroid cells. The Map kinase pathway is activated by the EpoR and is required for Epo to stimulate proliferation of erythroid cells. The transcription factor AP-1 is also activated by Epo and is required for Epo to stimulate proliferation of erythroid cells. The transcription factor Stat5 is activated by Epo and is required for Epo to stimulate proliferation of erythroid cells. The transcription factor Stat5 is activated by the EpoR and is required for Epo to stimulate proliferation of erythroid cells.",
  "The activation of T cells is a complex process that requires the interaction of multiple signaling pathways. The T cell receptor (TCR) and the costimulatory receptor CD2 8 provide the two signals that are required for T cell activation. The TCR activates a number of signaling pathways, including the phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) pathway, which leads to the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates the transcription factor NF-AT, causing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. IP3 causes the release of calcium from intracellular stores, which activates calcineurin, a phosphatase that activates the transcription factor NF-AT. The costimulatory signal provided by CD2 8 activates a number of signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway. The activation of PI3-K leads to the activation of the serine / threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates and activates phospholipase D1 (p1301). The activation of phospholipase D1 (p1301) leads to the production of DAG and the activation of PKC. The activation of the p1301 pathway also leads to the activation of the small G protein Rac1, which activates the p121ras / map kinase pathway. The map kinase pathway activated by the TCR and CD2 8 contributes to T cell activation by a number of different mechanisms. Map kinases phosphorylate the transcription factor ELK-1, which contributes to the activation of T cells. Map kinase also phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor AP-1, which contributes to T cell activation. Map kinase also activates the transcription factor NF-AT, which contributes to T cell activation by activating the transcription of IL-2.",
  "The immune system is comprised of two distinct cell types, lymphocytes and cells of the monocyte / macrophage lineage. The immune system must respond to a wide variety of foreign antigens, both foreign and self, in the form of proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, and whole cells. To respond to foreign antigens, the immune system must generate a large number of different types of lymphocytes. The T cell receptor is a heterodimer of two polypeptide chains, alpha and beta, each with a variable domain and a constant domain. The T cell receptor can recognize a single foreign antigen in the form of a small peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule on the surface of a cell. The CD40 ligand is expressed on the surface of B cells and macrophages and is involved in the activation of B cells. The CD40 ligand is also called CD25. The T cell receptor is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for the recognition of foreign antigens by T cells. The T cell receptor is a heterodimer of two polypeptide chains, alpha and beta.

  "The immune system is comprised of two major components, the humoral or serum immune system and the cellular immune system. The humoral immune system consists of antibodies that provide protection against specific infectious agents. The cellular immune system consists of a variety of different cell types, including B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. B cells produce antibodies that bind specific antigens and T cells and NK cells respond to specific antigens by proliferating and secreting cytokines that stimulate other cells in the immune system. The T cell receptor (TCR) is a cell surface protein complex that recognizes specific antigens associated with MHC proteins on the surface of other cells. The TCR is a heterodimer of alpha and beta chains in the case of the T cell, and gamma and delta chains in the case of the NK cell. The alpha and beta chains are each encoded by a separate gene, but the gamma and delta chains are encoded by the same gene as the CD3 genes that encode the CD3 complex that associates with the TCR to form the functional receptor. The CD3 complex is composed of three non-covalently associated polypeptides, CD3gamma, CD3delta, and CD3epsilon. The CD24 molecule is a single chain protein that is associated with the CD3 complex and is also a component of the TCR complex. The CD28 protein is a costimulatory protein that is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and is required for T cell activation. The CD28 protein binds to the T cell costimulatory receptor CD2 8 and is required for T cell activation.",
  "The transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed in Th2 cells and is involved in the regulation of Th2 cell differentiation. GATA-3 binds to the IL-4 promoter and activates the IL-4 gene. The activity of GATA-3 is regulated by post-translational modification and interaction with other proteins. Phosphorylation of GATA-3 by PKA and CaMK activates GATA-3. GATA-3 interacts with FOG-1, a cofactor that enhances GATA-3 activity. The interaction of GATA-3 and FOG-1 is mediated by the zinc finger domains of GATA-3 and the N-terminal domain of FOG-1. GATA-3 also interacts with CBP and P / CAF, two transcriptional coactivators that interact with other transcription factors. CBP and P / CAF interact with the N-terminal activation domain of GATA-3. CBP and P / CAF interact with the activation domains of CREB and NF-AT, transcription factors that also interact with GATA-3. CBP and P / CAF also interact with each other and may serve as a platform for the assembly of multiprotein complexes involved in gene regulation.",
  "The heat shock protein 4 0 (HSP4 0) family of proteins is involved in a variety of cellular processes including protein folding, assembly and translocation. The HSP4 0 proteins are cochaperones for the heat shock protein 7 0 (HSP7 0) family of proteins. The HSP4 0 proteins are also cochaperones for the immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), a member of the HSP7 0 family. The HSP4 0 proteins bind to unfolded proteins and deliver them to the HSP7 0 proteins, which then bind to unfolded proteins and assist in their folding. The HSP4 0 proteins are also cochaperones for BiP. The binding of unfolded proteins by the HSP4 0 proteins is regulated by the HSP4 0-associated proteins, HDJ-1 and HDJ-2. HDJ-1 and HDJ-2 are members of the HSP4 0 protein family that bind to the HSP4 0 proteins and regulate their activity. HDJ-1 and HDJ-2 are induced by heat shock and other stresses.

  "The development of blood vessels is essential for embryonic development and is also involved in a variety of pathological processes, including tumor angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis, stimulating endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival. The expression of VEGF is induced by hypoxia, and the resulting VEGF protein acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner to induce further VEGF expression and promote angiogenesis. The VEGF gene is transcriptionally activated by a number of stimuli, including hypoxia, growth factors, and oncogenes. The promoter region of the human VEGF gene contains several regulatory elements, including a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding site, an activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site, an E-box binding site for upstream stimulatory factor (USF), and a cyclic AMP-response element (CRE). The binding of HIF-1 and AP-1 to their cognate sites is required for the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene by hypoxia. The USF and CRE sites are also involved in the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene by growth factors and oncogenes. The activity of HIF-1 is regulated at the protein level by oxygen tension and growth factors. In the presence of oxygen, HIF-1alpha is rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets HIF-1alpha for degradation by the proteasome. The binding of VHL to HIF-1alpha is required for the degradation of HIF-1alpha. The binding of growth factors to their receptors leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) / AKT pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of VHL, thus increasing the levels of HIF-1alpha. The binding of growth factors to their receptors also leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor AP-1.",
  "The enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. ALAS is found in animals, plants, and bacteria. In animals, the gene for ALAS is regulated by heme. In bacteria, the gene for ALAS is found in the heme biosynthesis operon. In animals, the gene for ALAS is regulated by a feedback mechanism in which heme binds to the ALAS protein and blocks the translation of the mRNA. In bacteria, the gene for ALAS is not found in the heme biosynthesis operon. Instead, the gene for ALAS is regulated by a different mechanism in which heme activates the transcription of the gene for ALAS. In bacteria, the gene for ALAS is activated by the transcriptional activator HMP-synthase (HEM). In animals, the gene for ALAS is activated by the transcriptional activator GATA-1. In addition to the heme regulation of ALAS, there is also a second level of control of ALAS activity. In animals, the activity of ALAS is inhibited by succinyl-CoA. The binding of succinyl-CoA to ALAS causes a conformational change in the enzyme that inhibits the activity of ALAS.",
  "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a long-lasting increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission that is thought to be the molecular basis of learning and memory. It has been proposed that LTP is a result of the potentiation of AMPA receptor-mediated responses by a process involving the insertion of new AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. This process is triggered by the activation of NMDA receptors and is dependent on the influx of calcium through these receptors. The influx of calcium activates several signal transduction pathways, including the CaM kinase, PKC and MAPK cascades. These pathways in turn activate transcription factors such as CREB, CREB-2 and Elk-1, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression.",
  "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a major mediator of the actions of the second messenger cAMP. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two catalytic (C) subunits and two regulatory (R) subunits. The R subunits bind to four different inhibitory molecules, two cAMP molecules and two molecules of ATP. Binding of cAMP to the R subunits causes the C subunits to be released and to phosphorylate substrates. The R subunits are encoded by two genes, PRKAR1A and PRKAR2B, which are alternatively spliced to produce a variety of R subunit isoforms. The PRKAR1A gene is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations lead to the disease Carney complex. The PRKAR1A gene encodes two protein products, RIalpha and RIIalpha. The PRKAR1A gene is also the locus of mutations in the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. The PRKAR1A mutations lead to a reduction in the level of the normal RIalpha protein, which may contribute to the development of the disease. The PKA regulatory subunits are also substrates for PKA phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the PKA regulatory subunits by PKA results in the dissociation of the tetrameric holoenzyme and the activation of the C subunits. The PKA C subunits are constitutively active and are able to phosphorylate their substrates without further activation by cAMP. The PKA C subunits are able to phosphorylate a variety of substrates, including other protein kinases such as the PKC isoforms, and transcription factors such as CREB. The PKC isoforms are a family of kinases that are activated by lipids such as diacylglycerol and are involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation. The PKC isoforms are encoded by a family of genes, and the PKC isoforms are differentially regulated by both lipids and calcium. The PKC isoforms are differentially regulated by both lipids and calcium. The PKC isoforms are also differentially regulated by phosphorylation. The PKC isoforms are also differentially regulated by phosphorylation. The PKC isoforms are also differentially regulated by phosphorylation. The PKC isoforms are also differentially regulated by their own dephosphorylation.",
  "Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a mitogen for a variety of cells including fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. PDGF binds to two receptor tyrosine kinases, the alpha and beta receptors. Binding of PDGF to the receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase. The PDGF receptor is a member of the tyrosine kinase gene family. The PDGF receptor is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is the ligand binding subunit and the beta subunit is required for signaling. The PDGF receptor is structurally similar to the EGF receptor with an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain containing the tyrosine kinase domain. The PDGF receptor is activated by dimerization induced by ligand binding. The PDGF receptor is constitutively associated with src and other tyrosine kinases. The src kinase phosphorylates the PDGF receptor on tyrosine residues. The src phosphorylated PDGF receptor is a substrate for the PDGF receptor kinase. The src phosphorylated PDGF receptor is a more potent substrate for the PDGF receptor kinase. The src phosphorylated PDGF receptor is more potent as an activator of ras mediated signaling. The src kinase also phosphorylates and activates phospholipase C gamma 1. The src activated phospholipase C gamma 1 is more active in hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate to form inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate is a second messenger that mobilizes intracellular calcium. DAG activates protein kinase C and activates ras mediated signaling. The activation of ras and phospholipase C by src contributes to the mitogenic response to PDGF. The activation of p21 (RAC1) by PDGF contributes to the mitogenic response to PDGF. The activation of p21 (RAC1) by PDGF contributes to the activation of the Jun kinase pathway by PDGF.",
  "Fibrinogen is a soluble plasma protein that is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin, the major protein of blood clots. The cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the A and B chains of fibrinogen. The A alpha chain is the N-terminal of the three chains. The B beta chain is the C-terminal and the gamma chain is a disulfide linked dimer. The fibrin clot is stabilized by the interaction of the gamma chains. The cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the N-terminal peptide of the A alpha chain and the C-terminal peptide of the B beta chain. The cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin releases the N-terminal peptide of the A alpha chain and the C-terminal peptide of the B beta chain. The removal of these peptides by plasmin and other enzymes releases the peptides that form the fibrin clot.",
  "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Viral nucleic acids are recognized by two classes of PRRs, membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic receptors. In the cytosol, viral nucleic acids are recognized by two classes of receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) -like receptors (RLRs) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). These two classes of receptors induce the expression of type I interferon and other cytokines, which are important for eliminating viruses. The first line of defense against viruses is the recognition of viral nucleic acids by PRRs. In the cytosol, viral RNA is recognized by two classes of receptors, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS).

These two classes of receptors induce the expression of type I interferon and other cytokines, which are important for eliminating viruses. In the RLR family, RIG-I and MDA5 are RNA helicases that recognize viral RNA in the cytosol. In contrast, the third RLR, LGP2, has a helicase domain but lacks the domains required for downstream signaling. It is thought that LGP2 positively regulates RLR signaling by facilitating the recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I and MDA5. In addition to RIG-I and MDA5, cGAS is a sensor of DNA in the cytosol. Upon recognition of DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP, which activates the adaptor protein STING (also known as MITA, ERIS, or MPYS). cGAMP then activates the transcription factor NF-kB and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which induce the expression of type I interferon and other cytokines.",
  "Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play a key role in apoptosis. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens (pro-caspases) that are cleaved to generate two subunits, one containing the active site and the other containing a region that determines the substrate specificity of the protease. Caspases are separated into two groups based on their structure and function. The first group includes caspase-1, -2, -4, -5, and -1 1, which are called inflammatory caspases, and are involved in the cleavage of procytokines to produce cytokines that stimulate inflammation. The second group includes caspase-3, -6, and -7, which are called apoptotic caspases, and are involved in the cleavage of key cellular proteins leading to the destruction of the cell. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are the apical caspases in apoptosis. Caspase-8 is activated by the Fas receptor and other death receptors, and then cleaves and activates caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6, and-7 are the main effector caspases that cleave cellular proteins leading to the destruction of the cell. Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent apoptosis, and Bax and Bak promote apoptosis. Bax and Bak induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which activates caspase-9 and the downstream caspases. IAP proteins block apoptosis by binding to caspases and inhibiting their activity.",
  "Eph receptors are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by their membrane-bound ligands, ephrins. Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in a highly coordinated fashion during development, and are involved in a variety of developmental processes, including axon guidance, angiogenesis, and topographic mapping of the nervous system. The Eph receptors and ephrins are also expressed in the adult nervous system, where they may play a role in synaptic plasticity. The signaling pathways downstream of Eph receptors are not well characterized, but appear to involve the ras-MAP kinase pathway and cytoskeletal elements.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that signals through a receptor complex that includes gp8 0 and gp1 3 0 subunits. The gp8 0 receptor is used by the IL-6 family of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM. The gp1 3 0 receptor is used by the IL-6 family of cytokines as well as the IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1 3, and IL-15 cytokines. The gp1 3 0 receptor is used by these cytokines to activate the JAK / STAT, Ras / MAPK, and PI3 kinase pathways. The JAK / STAT pathway is the best characterized of the signaling pathways activated by the IL-6 family of cytokines. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor complex results in activation of the associated JAK kinases. The JAKs phosphorylate the receptor subunits, creating binding sites for the STAT transcription factors. The STATs are then phosphorylated and activated by the JAKs. The STATs then translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. The Ras / MAPK pathway is also activated by the IL-6 family of cytokines. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor complex results in activation of the JAK kinases and the subsequent recruitment of Shc and the Grb-2 / Sos complex to the receptor complex. Ras is activated by the Grb-2 / Sos complex and activates Raf-1, MEK-1, and MAP kinase. The Ras / MAPK pathway is also activated by growth factors and cytokines that activate the JAK / STAT pathway. The Ras / MAPK pathway is involved in many cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The activation of the Ras / MAPK pathway by the IL-6 family of cytokines may be involved in the activation of acute phase genes in hepatocytes and other cells.",
  "Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow direct communication between cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of two hemichannels (or connexons), each contributed by each of the neighboring cells. Each connexon is made up of six connexins (Cx). Each of the 2 1 known mammalian connexin genes can form a connexon when paired with another connexin. Each of the three major connexin subtypes (Cxs 2 6, Cxs 3 2, and Cxs 6 0) is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Each connexin has its own specific properties, including their permeability, voltage gating, and turnover rate. Each of the three major connexin subtypes can form a connexon with each of the other subtypes. The formation of gap junctions is a complex process that involves the oligomerization of the six connexins into a connexon, the docking of two connexons, and the anchoring of the channel to the cytoskeleton. Gap junctions are essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and electrical coupling of cells. Gap junction channels allow the direct transfer of ions, small molecules, and second messengers between cells. The permeability of gap junction channels is determined by the connexin type and the composition of the connexons. The transfer of small molecules is regulated by transjunctional voltage, transjunctional pH, and transjunctional and intracellular Ca2 + concentration. Gap junction channels are permeable to ions, small metabolites, and second messengers. The gating of gap junctions is influenced by a variety of factors, including transjunctional voltage, transjunctional and intracellular Ca2 + concentration, pH, and redox state. Gap junctions are essential for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Mutations in connexin genes have been associated with a number of human diseases.",
  "The cytochrome P4 5 0 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes is involved in the oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. The human genome contains 4 8 genes that encode CYPs, which are classified into five families and 3 0 subfamilies on the basis of their amino acid sequence similarities. The first four families are classed as the CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3 families, and the fifth is classed as the CYP4 family. The CYP4 family includes CYP7A1, CYP8A1, CYP7B1, CYP1A4, CYP1A5, CYP2B1, CYP2B2, CYP2Cs, CYP2Es, CYP2Fs, CYP2Gs, CYP2Js, CYP2U1, CYP2W9, CYP2U1 0, CYP2W11, CYP2X1, CYP2X2, CYP2VA1, CYP2X1and CYP2W12 genes. The CYP4 family is responsible for the metabolism of cholesterol and the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. The CYP7A1, CYP1A4, CYP1A5, and CYP2B1 genes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. The CYP1E1, CYP2A6, CYP2J2, CYP2R1, and CYP3A4 genes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. The CYP7A1, CYP1E1, CYP2J2, and CYP2R1 genes are involved in the metabolism of vitamin E. The CYP2F, CYP2W, CYP2X, and CYP2Z genes are not functionally characterized.",
  "The cell cycle is a highly conserved process that consists of four distinct phases, G1, S, G2 and M, and is regulated by a variety of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The G1-to-S phase transition is the major regulatory point in the cell cycle. The activity of CDKs is positively regulated by cyclins and negatively regulated by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs). The activity of CDKs is further regulated by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CDKs. The phosphorylation of RB by CDKs leads to the dissociation of RB from E2F and the subsequent activation of E2F-dependent transcription. The activation of Cdc2kinase by Cdc2-cyclin A or Cdc2kinase by Cdc2-cyclin B is required for the G1-to-S transition. The activation of Cdc2kinase by Cdc2kinase-cyclin Db1and Cdc2kinase-cyclin Db2triggers the initiation of DNA replication. The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures the attachment of all chromosomes to the mitotic spindle before anaphase.",
  "The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is a multisubunit structure that is expressed on the surface of T cells and is responsible for the recognition of specific antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of other cells. The TCR complex is composed of two chains, the alpha and beta chains that are responsible for binding antigen and two or three gamma, delta, or epsilon chains that are responsible for binding MHC. The CD3 complex is associated with the TCR complex and is responsible for the transduction of activation signals in response to antigen binding. The CD28 molecule is a T cell costimulatory molecule that is involved in the activation of T cells. The CD24 molecule is a cell surface marker that is upregulated after T cell activation and is involved in T cell differentiation. The Fas-Fas ligand interaction is involved in the regulation of the immune response through the induction of apoptosis of activated T cells.",
  "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacterium that lives in the human stomach. It colonizes more than half of the world's population. Colonization of H. pylori causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. H. pylori infection induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, and the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. The vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) is a major virulence factor of H. pylori. It is a secreted protein that forms anion-selective channels in membranes. The VacA induces intracellular vacuoles in cultured cells. The induction of vacuoles by VacA is dependent on the cellular endosomal system. The intracellular delivery of VacA causes the swelling of late endosomes and lysosomes. The vacuolating activity of H. pylori is also dependent on the endosomal system. The cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA) is another virulence factor of H. pylori. It is translocated into the cytoplasm of gastric epithelial cells by a type IV secretion system. Once inside the cell, CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by the src family kinases, which leads to the activation of the transcription factor AP-1. AP-1 activation by CagA is involved in the induction of cell elongation and motility by H. pylori.",
  "Lysosomes are membrane-delimited organelles that contain more than 50 hydrolases, including proteases, phosphatases, and glycosidases, and are ubiquitous in animal cells. Lysosomes are the major site for the degradation of macromolecules internalized via endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy. The degradation of macromolecules takes place in the acidic environment of the lysosome, and the liberated amino acids and monosaccharides are transported out of the lysosome into the cytoplasm for new synthesis of macromolecules. Lysosomal membrane contains a variety of proteins that are involved in the formation of the membrane boundary, the regulation of membrane permeability, the uptake and transport of substrates, and the coupling of these processes to the proton-motive force.",
  "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that is involved in the regulation of many different cellular processes. One of the cellular processes regulated by IL-6 is the immune response. IL-6 also plays a role in the response to injury and infection. IL-6 is also involved in the regulation of the acute phase response, liver metabolism, and bone resorption. IL-6 signals through a receptor complex that is composed of two different subunits, the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and the glycoprotein 1 3 0 (gp1 3 0). Binding of IL-6 to the IL-6R causes the recruitment of gp1 3 0 to the receptor complex and activation of signaling pathways. The JAK / STAT pathway is one of the pathways activated by IL-6. JAKs are a family of tyrosine kinases that are activated by cytokines and are involved in the activation of signaling pathways. One of the targets of the JAK kinases is the STAT family of transcription factors. STAT proteins are activated by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in response to JAK activation. Once phosphorylated, STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of genes containing STAT binding sites. One of the genes activated by STAT proteins is SOCS-3, a negative regulator of JAK / STAT signaling. Another target of JAK / STAT signaling is the AP-1 transcription factor. The Jun and Fos proteins form the AP-1 transcription factor. IL-6 activates both the Jun and Fos proteins to activate AP-1 transcription. The activation of AP-1 transcription by IL-6 is involved in the activation of many different genes by IL-6. The activation of AP-1 transcription by IL-6 is involved in the activation of the acute phase response.",
  "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that lack antigen receptors and do not rearrange antigen receptors but are able to lyse cells that display foreign antigens on their surface. NK cells are classified into two groups: the first group kills target cells without prior sensitization, and the second group requires prior sensitization. The first group of NK cells is responsible for spontaneous cytotoxicity. The second group of NK cells is activated by cytokines such as IL-2, IL-1 2, and interferon-gamma. The activation of NK cells is associated with the expression of adhesion molecules and the release of cytotoxic granules. The main effector molecules of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity are perforin, granzyme, and Fas ligand. Perforin is a protein that forms pores in the membrane of the target cell, allowing the release of proteases. Granzymes are proteases that enter the target cell and activate caspases, which lead to apoptosis. Fas ligand is a membrane protein that binds to Fas on the surface of the target cell and activates apoptosis.",
  "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that signals through a receptor complex that includes the IL-4Ralpha chain and the IL-13Ralpha chain. The IL-4 receptor complex is expressed on many cell types and is involved in the regulation of cells involved in allergic responses. The IL-4 receptor complex activates several signaling pathways, including the JAK / Stat6 pathway and the Map kinase pathways. The Map kinase pathways activated by IL-4 include the Erk, JNK and p3 8 pathways. The Map kinase pathways activated by IL-4 are distinct from the Map kinase pathways activated by growth factors and cytokines that activate the Ras / Erk pathway. The JAK / Stat6 pathway is also activated by IL-4 and is involved in the regulation of gene expression by IL-4. The Map kinase pathways activated by IL-4 are involved in the regulation of gene expression by IL-4. The Map kinase pathways activated by IL-4 are involved in the regulation of the Map kinase pathways by other cytokines and growth factors. The Map kinase pathways activated by IL-4 are involved in the regulation of gene expression by IL-4. The JAK / Stat pathway is also involved in the regulation of gene expression by IL-4. The Map kinase pathways activated by IL-4 are involved in the regulation of gene expression by IL-4.",
  "The coagulation cascade is a series of enzymatic reactions that lead to the formation of a clot. The cascade begins with the exposure of tissue factor (TF) on the surface of activated cells. The TF / VIIa complex activates factors IX and X, which combine to form the protease Xa. The activated factors IXa and Xa then activate factors II and V, which form thrombin. Thrombin activates factors V and fibrinogen, which combine to form fibrin. The fibrin clot is then stabilized by the action of factor XIII. Antithrombin III (AT-III) is an important inhibitor of coagulation. The thrombin-antithrombin III complex inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, and also degrades fibrinogen. Congenital deficiency of antithrombin III is associated with venous thrombosis. Congenital deficiency of protein C or protein S is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Congenital or acquired deficiency of these natural anticoagulants results in a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Congenital deficiency of protein C or protein S is found in 1-2% of the population. Acquired deficiency of these proteins is seen in patients with autoimmune disease, malignancy, or the use of certain drugs. Acquired deficiency of these proteins is seen in patients with liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, and in patients receiving oral contraceptives. Congenital or acquired deficiencies of these natural anticoagulants result in a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Congenital deficiency of protein C or protein S is associated with a mild to moderate increase in the risk of arterial thrombosis. Acquired deficiency of these proteins is seen in patients with autoimmune disease, malignancy, or the use of certain drugs. Acquired deficiency of these proteins is seen in patients with liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, or in patients receiving oral contraceptives. Congenital or acquired deficiency of antithrombin III is associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis. Congenital or acquired deficiency of antithrombin III is associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis."
